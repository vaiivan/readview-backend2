    "Updated review with additional thoughts and reading recommendations:\n\nKeep in mind that this book is written to address a person who is in the anxious role, so it has a reassuring and quelling tone that may not be relatable for a partner who is using de-activating strategies and shutting down. The unfortunate cost of this tone in the book is also that it inadvertently condones or, at least, doesn’t sufficiently take a stance on abusive behaviors. The book omits a critical perspective on the intersection of attachment patterns and gender. Put simply, while attachment styles themselves aren’t gendered, the strategies available for expressing these styles have a socially determined component. For example, when a male-identified individual who is in an anxious role in a relationship resorts to strategies such as controlling behaviors, name-calling, yelling and demanding, etc, there is a gender violence element here that has a social dimension and needs to be named. Attached takes no stance on this and, in the wrong hands, can be quite harmful for this reason rather than empowering.\n\nIn my view, the reason for this failure is that Attached treats all anxious-avoidant attachment style mismatches as problematic and doesn’t make a clear distinction between when these patterns are abusive versus when they are a normal part of the differences in a relationship (after all, to some extent, all relationships have some degree of attachment style mismatch). The cost of erasing this distinction is that abusive behaviors aren’t named and, on the flip side, relationships that are salvageable and hopeful are treated as a dead-end that will probably always have problems; the book makes a lackluster note about how to use communication to try to improve an anxious-avoidant relationship but its resounding message is clear: you will probably “always” have these problems and the gold star solution is to find a partner with a “secure” attachment style.\n\nAs a therapist—and as a therapist who uses attachment theory in my work—I found this overarching message in the book bizarre. There already exists a method of couple's therapy based on attachment called Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) and it has a high success rate helping couples in anxious-avoidant patterns. So, I was quite surprised by the overriding message in Attached about finding a \"securely attached\" partner as the solution to relationship mismatches. The very premise of attachment-based couple's therapy from day one is that the problem is not one’s partner--it's the painful pattern both are stuck in and the pattern can be modified. The communication strategies in Attached fall short of how to address the attachment mismatch because the book is overly focused on helping one leave a relationship and find a “securely” attached partner.\n\nIf you are in an anxious-avoidant relationship pattern, and want a more hopeful, effective approach, I recommend instead that you try reading Sue Johnson’s “Hold me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love”. I also recommend reading/watching more about EFT—there is a great YouTube channel by Anabel Bugatti, for example, and many others. When you look for a couple’s therapist, interview them to see if they know about attachment and, if you can, find someone versed in EFT.\n\nThere is a clear method for helping anxious-avoidant couples and it’s pretty straightforward but there is an order to it: the “avoidant” partner has to be engaged first (in EFT, this step is called “withdrawer re-engagement”), and then the “anxious” partner is able to communicate more clearly and listen with less blame, once they hear a non-defensive version of their “avoidant” partner’s attachment needs (this step is called Blamer Softening in EFT); the cycle is repeated several times until the couple integrates a new, less defensive pattern. Attached, though, flies right in the face of what we know about attachment itself when it recommends to an anxious partner (to whom the book is addressed) that they can try to apply healthy communication strategies to try to improve the relationship. This is probably an impossible emotional feat for someone caught up in the more intense mismatches (fears of abandonment, need for reassurance, etc)— at least not without individual therapy and without couple’s therapy whose interventions are applied in the correct order. There is an interview somewhere online with Sue Johnson where she says that once partners are activated in an argument, they can’t just easily apply communication strategies to calm down (I’ll share it when I find it). That doesn't mean it's hopeless or that the solution is to externalize the problem and look for a \"securely attached\" partner or to become resolved to always having such problems, as the book seems to suggest.\n\nThat being said, as I mentioned in the beginning, there are times that it’s important to make a distinction between a difficult relationship dance and unacceptable abusive behaviors that warrant leaving. I don’t think Attached is much help with this distinction. In addition to being mum about abusive relationships, the book is also pretty mum about trauma and its impact on relationships. Down-regulating behaviors that look like shutting down and withdrawal can be responses to trauma. There is next to no empathy in Attached toward such down-regulating behaviors and no acknowledgement that they are understandanble and protective responses to trauma triggers. On the other hand, control, name-calling and blame can be expressions of anxious attachment and also signs of abuse and gender violence. Keep in mind, something can be both abusive *and* anxious attachment at the same time. Similarly, something can be both a response to trauma *and* avoidant attachment at the same time. Attachment patterns are a surface presentation—they can be a very useful lens to look through if you and your partner are willing to work through the problems together and look for couple’s counseling. But, there are times when it is also important to name that something more than attachment is at play— abuse, trauma, etc.\n\nOn this last note, as in my original review, I want to say a little bit about going beyond attachment in order to understand one’s relationship choices better. Attachment patterns are the surface and they don’t speak to underlying dynamics. Attached makes a puzzling and simplistic suggestion that, through conscious intention, you can somehow train yourself to be interested in partners who do not register to you as exciting or familiar. There are issues that cannot be resolved simply by switching partners. For example, if one tends to take on more “anxious” roles in relationships with partners who act more “avoidantly”, there are a host of important questions to understand there that will not be resolved, but repeated (or simply inverted), by switching partners. Growth for a person in such a role could come from owning that connecting to loving/desiring emotions is only possible for them at a distance and working through what that is all about. A person in this role might very well react avoidantly themselves when faced with a partner who is trying to be closer.\n\nThere is an idea in an approach called Imago Therapy that every individual has an early imprint or working model of what they find attractive based on experiences with those closest to them. Attraction, on this view, comes from finding a partner who at once resembles a familiar trait that felt problematic in a parent/caregiver but also that carries hope of a solution to the problematic trait. For example, if one felt constrained by a controlling parent, a hopeful match for that individual might be a partner who resembles the parent in some way yet who is willing to expand and offer autonomy. What’s crucial is that the person in this basic example does not simply desire autonomy from just any partner—they desire autonomy from someone who they experience as controlling. Both pieces are important— the familiar and the missing quality. On this view, the best chance for growth and contentment comes when partners who are excited by a familiar unconscious bond both own their part of their pattern and agree to the work together, something Attached barely encourages.\n\nUnconscious dynamics are something to focus more on in one’s individual therapy— I still think attachment theory, when applied correctly, is the most hopeful lens we have when it comes to couple’s therapy. For anyone struggling in an anxious-avoidant relationship pattern, I highly recommend looking into Emotionally Focused couple’s therapy for a more hopeful and effective approach than in this book. Good luck and thanks for all the comments/questions about my original review!\n\n----- Original review below----\nAs a counselor, I give this book to people (most usually women) who are in abusive relationships where their physical and emotional safety is on the line and who need to empower themselves to flee, but I typically do not recommend it to anyone else. One of the main principles of therapy is that, in order to grow, a person first has to locate the problem as internal to the self, i.e. be able to take ownership. This book is in many ways simplistic and misleading in that it seems to confuse maladaptive relationships with abusive ones and reads as though it is helping a victim get out of a trap, reinforcing a lack of ownership that is a prerequisite for any form of personal or relational growth.\n\nThe deeper issue is that the book, perhaps in an effort to present an oversimplified version of attachment theory to the layperson, does not make it clear that “avoidant”, “secure” and “anxious” are patterns of relating *between people* rather than something that lives within people as an essential identity. These are dimensions, not categories, so people can locate their responses along a continuum on the avoidant and anxious dimensions depending on many contextual and relational factors. It is common, perhaps expected, for relationships to suffer from maladaptive patterns over time (it's like a car that needs maintenance) and these are fixable when both partners own their piece and do the work. Unfortunately, this book discourages partners who have taken on a more anxious role in a pattern from locating any internal ownership and suggests that if they roam the world and find one of these magical partners called “secures”, all their problems will be resolved. This is not any different than the trite self-help advice we have heard before about finding a partner with x,y,z characteristics as a solution to internal problems, just dressed up in the sexy, recently prominent language of attachment theory. Rather than locating the problem in the pattern and suggesting that changing your relationship to a partner is possible with ownership on both sides, the book suggests that the problem lives in the partner.\n\nI have sat with many couples during therapy where one partner has taken on a more anxious strategy and the other a more avoidant strategy. Many of these couples love each other deeply and are able to fix the pattern between them. This book seems to suggest that these roles are somehow essential traits rather than strategies that can be modified, and discourages a focus on fixing the pattern. This book further seems to suggest that the attraction between such partners rests on a confusion of chaotic feelings that come from attachment distress with genuine love, which is very misleading and does not do justice to the meaningful and deep connection partners in this pattern have to each other.\n\nEDIT: Many folks in the comments have asked about what books I would recommend instead. I highly recommend books about Emotionally Focused Couple's therapy-- it's an approach developed by Sue Johnson and it's based on attachment theory, too. But I find that the application of attachment theory in EFT's approach isn't oversimplified the way it is in this book and it offers a lot of hope to couples in anxious-avoidant patterns. EFT has a high success rate working with these dynamics and views them as a normal part of the dance of relationships. If you are struggling in such a pattern, I would recommend Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love by Sue Johnson.\n\nAnother very puzzling and simplistic suggestion in the book is that through conscious intention, you can somehow cause yourself to be interested in partners who do not register to your unconscious mind as exciting or familiar in any way. Every person has an early imprint or working model of what they find attractive and exciting, based on experiences with those closest to them. People who register as boring and unexciting to us do so for an important reason—they are people whose “crazy” does not fit our “crazy” in a way that has the potential to heal us and teach us the most important lessons about ourselves that we need to learn. For example, if one tends to take on anxious roles in relationships with partners who then respond more avoidantly, there are a host of important questions to work through that won’t be resolved, but simply replicated, by switching partners. Such a person, to grow, needs to own that connecting to loving and desiring emotions is only possible for them at a distance, and they need to look inward to figure out what that is all about in order to stop acting in those ways. Could such a person take in affection and care when a partner tries to come close to them, or will such a person in turn react avoidantly themselves? How many times have we seen an anxious person turn avoidant when caring and available partners come their way? In this way, the book fails to address that there are deeper dynamics responsible for attraction that cannot be resolved by switching partners and that “anxious” and “avoidant” are surface presentations of underlying dynamics that need to be worked through to be resolved. For example, if one felt unloved and constrained by a controlling parent, happiness for that individual comes from finding a partner who at once resembles that familiar parent yet who is willing to expand and offer autonomy. What’s crucial is that the person in question does not simply desire autonomy from any random person— they desire autonomy from someone whom they experienced as controlling. And you can bet your life that this individual will keep reenacting this scenario by picking controlling partners and then struggle to twist autonomy out of them. Both pieces are important— the familiar and the missing quality. The best chance for growth and contentment comes when partners who are excited by a familiar unconscious bond both own their part of the pattern and agree to do the work together, something this book barely encourages.",
    "My psychiatrist pretty much made me order this book even though in my mind I was dead set against, thinking it was going to be a waste of time, perfectly convinced I knew everything about myself and whatever kind of \"attached\" I was.\n\nWhoa.\n\nWas I wrong.\n\nAnd I hate to be wrong. Thanks, Dr. D.\n\nGeneral Information: This book is an easy read. It's not that stuff you need to be a rocket-scientist to figure out - in layman terms it briefs you on the broader different styles of attachment: secure, anxious and avoidant. The book helps you determine what kind of attachment styles you have via reading examples of others attachment styles and there are also some quizzes if you're still not sure, all of which I found useful. I really liked that the authors presented examples of scenarios of attachment styles and encouraged the reader to read through the scenarios and guess the kind of attachment styles that were presented based on the knowledge we had already been given in the earlier part of the book. I find that a helpful way to learn.\n\nGiven that I was not into reading this in the first place - the fact that it was light reading, interesting and at times fun - made me very attuned to what this book had to say. I agree it wasn't super in-depth but I don't fault this book for that because if it was super in depth I would have not even read it. My psychiatrist knows what the heck she is talking about and she choose this book for a reason - so I have zero complaints. I think she was even impressed with how much I was able to take away after reading it in one day.\n\nPersonal Information:\n\nThis book taught me a lot about myself. With women, I have anxious attachments - stemming from an unpredictable childhood. I pretty much tend to gravitate toward any one who acts maternal with me and cling to her. This isn't necessarily about romantic attachment for me, it spelled out a lot of patterns with all the people I have in my life: from friends, family members, partners and even my doctors.\n\nI had started to notice that I was feeling unsettled in my relationship with my fiance. I was getting annoyed at everything he did. Little things, like the way he chewed. I would get annoyed when he would text me and completely ignore him for hours at a time. Until I read this book, I didn't realize the problem was me and that with men I have a very avoidant attachment style. I was able to take the criticism to heart without feeling persecuted because the book doesn't make you feel that way even though avoidants can come off as very very harsh and cruel and indifferent.\n\nI'm now able to communicate more effectively, recognize my own patterns of behavior, identify that I am responsible for my own actions and feelings and now I feel a real sense of control and independence because I have that knowledge. I have that security. I can reciprocate with my fiance now and not be so dismissive of him and I'm able to be a bit more open without feeling that he's trying to stop me from being my own person or that he's suffocating me.\n\nI highly recommend this book. If you want to delve super deep into this attachment thing - some other reviewers mentioned additions and alternatives but I wouldn't. I am a very learned person, a very intelligent person and I didn't need anything more in depth than this book to help me to start to recognize patterns that needed to change. I think this book is best served to people who can admit where they are on the attachment continuum. I happen to be at a place in my life now, thanks to my psychiatrist and therapist, where I am able to let my guard down a bit and accept things that are difficult for me to accept.. Maybe even just six months ago I wouldn't have been ready to admit this. But given my ability to be ready and my desire to make things right in my life now that I have a child - I didn't need a guide book to tell me how to figure out the things I needed to do to fix the areas that needed work in my life regarding my attachment styles.\n\nI disagree with the reviews that claim this book doesn't offer us any insight as to why we are the way we are and what we can do about it. Several times this book mentions the theories of infant and other kinds of attachments but does say that it's not the purpose of this book to delve into that. That's good enough for me. I was able to discern from the minimal but powerful examples they give of the attachment styles of infants to their caregivers to know why I am the way I am and I wrote a whole essay about it to share with my psychiatrist.... thanks to this book.\n\nAs for what we can do about it - this was also something I didn't need a road map for. This is going to sound pretty darn simplistic but maybe that's just because it is. Kind of just do the opposite of what you're doing....???? That is how this has been working for me, anyway. But of course, I relied on the examples in the book to help direct my behavior without needing a \"HOW TO\" direction stamped across the page. You rely on your intuition. You rely on your knowledge. You rely on your empathy and most of all you rely on your willingness to enact change.\n\nThe examples in this book were definitely not apples to apples with how I am with my fiance - but it was enough of an eye-opening experience for me to say to myself: \"Oh geez..... I do things like this all the time and this is how my fiance must feel. He's just reacting to my avoidance. If I start to try to be less avoidant and give him a little bit more security by acknowledging him maybe he won't feel so frustrated or taken advantage of or hurt.\"\n\nAnd that's what I started to do. I started to recognize the behaviors I have that are avoidant and started to replace them with more healthy behaviors. At first this wasn't easy. I felt like I was losing a part of myself by giving in to him but then I realized that's silly and I went back to the book for guidance and reassurance and that's when I decided to feel more secure and in control. I'm far more independent by making the right, healthy choices for our relationship than I am being a slave to my fear of dependency. I really feel empowered by this and I thank the authors for putting this out there in a way that isn't complicated but that is so very helpful.",
    "First of all, I really enjoyed reading this book. This is far more insightful than what I learned in my psych courses on attachment theory. I also appreciated the sheer number of examples used in the book, which helped to clarify the authors’ points.\n\nIt was illuminating to see the many tendencies of different attachment types, especially when we see some attitudes that are prevalent in society. (E.g. The avoidant’s complaints that their partner is being needy, clingy, or demanding; the anxious partner’s apprehension towards the fate of their relationship if their mate takes too long to reply to their text messages.) Because such attitudes and beliefs are widely heard of in our society, we might believe that they are all true and valid beliefs. They are not. In fact, I recognize that they are the products of emotional reasoning—“I feel like this, therefore it’s true.”\n\nThe self-assessment was helpful, as it uncovered some misunderstandings I had about myself. I thought I was mostly secure but with an avoidant bent, and that I was rarely anxious. However, in the test results, I am indeed predominantly secure, with a few anxious and avoidant tendencies—but I had more anxious than avoidant characteristics! This was quite a surprise. What’s more, I realized that I have fantasies about taking care of and comforting an anxious partner.\n\nIn addition, I loved the special sections on the avoidant-anxious couple, and why they tend to attract each other. The chapter on effective communication was enlightening too.\n\nThere are a few things that I would have liked to see in the book, though. For starters, I was struck by how all of the example couples were of the opposite gender (male-female). There was not a single same-gender couple. And there was only one potentially gay person, who was portrayed in a negative light. He was a guy figuring out his sexual orientation, and was depicted as a guy who was stringing women along, even though he was slowly discovering that he was not into females. He apparently had intentions to bring home a girlfriend to please his family too.\n\nNot that I think anyone should use someone of the opposite gender to pretend to be heterosexual to their parents. However, it felt disheartening as a gay person myself, to see the only explicitly queer person in the book perceived in such a poor light. It’s like reading those stories where the only gay character in the book is the main villain. It feels terrible.\n\nAlso, I know most people are still unaware of this, but it bothers me that many books, including this one, are still using the phrases “he or she,” “him or her,” “his or her,” “(s)he,” etc. I would really appreciate it if they used the gender neutral “they,” “their,” “them” instead, since not all folks use “he” or “she” pronouns. Plus, some folks are nonbinary, i.e. neither “male” nor “female.”\n\nSecondly, the authors say that anxious men and avoidant women exist, so we shouldn’t assume that anxious and avoidant attachment styles are tied to gender. Yet, in this book, the vast majority of anxious people were women, and almost all of the avoidant people were men…I wish we could see more avoidant females and anxious males in the examples.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I felt that there was a strong sympathy for anxious individuals, whilst the avoidants were often seen as the bad guys, the jerks, and the heartbreakers. Some examples of avoidants in the book, were downright emotionally and verbally abusive! (Being afraid of closeness, does not give anyone the excuse to belittle and insult their partner.) I don’t doubt that some avoidants treat their partners terribly, but surely there are other avoidants who are not that cruel, as well as some anxious and secure partners who are nasty too.\n\nVery many, if not most, of the avoidants in this book behaved so coldly and hurtfully, that this sample of avoidants inevitably demonizes them. Even some of the behaviors and attitudes listed for avoidants were quite atrocious, e.g. more likely to be unfaithful, denigrating and devaluing their partner, etc. It would be very nice if there was a more sympathetic perspective on avoidants, so we can understand their world more. Since most avoidants in the book were men, and there is already so much vilification of men in our society, the avoidants were made to look even worse. I don’t believe that all, or even most, avoidants are horrible and selfish romantic partners, though.\n\nThere were some points made about avoidants that could be confused with aromantics. I know aromantics are generally unknown or misunderstood by the general population, but still, I wish there was more differentiation between aros and avoidants here.\n\nFurthermore, I would love to know more about how an anxious-avoidant couple could still work, aside from having the anxious partner lower their standards for closeness (a one-sided compromise). Couldn’t the avoidant partner make some compromises too?\n\nThere was a section on finding and emulating secure role models, which sounds promising, but it was not as detailed or in depth as I hoped it to be. How can an avoidant partner make themselves more responsive and available to their partner? Is there any way they can become more comfortable with closeness over time? Instead of just making grudging accommodations for their anxious partner? On the other side of the coin, is there a way that anxious folks can become more comfortable with space and distance? Related to this last point, I’ve heard of one writer, who might have an avoidant attachment style, explain it like this (not the exact wording): “We need time away from our partner to rest and replenish our energy. Afterwards, we will be happy to engage with our partner again. Wanting to take a break from you doesn’t mean we don’t love you. It just means we need some time alone to recharge.” Isn’t this a much more positive and sympathetic portrayal of avoidants? This way, they don’t look like heartless, cold-blooded people.\n\nI would be quite curious to learn about secure-avoidant couples. From what I understood, secures do crave emotional closeness, so even though they don’t take their partner’s distance personally, would the secures still feel a little sad inside? Also, just because someone is avoidant, does that mean they can never give and receive emotional intimacy at all? My impression is that they do have some moments of closeness or emotional expressiveness. In fact, I recall one avoidant in the book who had no problems saying the words, “I love you.”\n\nIn a similar vein, I would like to see more examples of an avoidant partner who uses effective communication to tell their partner their needs, where their partner (even an anxious one) accepts, and where it doesn’t sound like the avoidant is Mirandizing their lover, and absolving themselves of all responsibility. The relationship is not just about the avoidant’s needs and desires, after all. It’s also about their partners’ wants and needs.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see how an anxious-anxious couple would be like. Would they fare better than the typical avoidant-anxious couple?\n\nFinally, there were two concepts that were briefly mentioned but not elaborated on: What is disorganized attachment? And how are people who are both avoidant and anxious like? I would be happy to know more about these two categories of folks.\n\nI loved this book very much, thus the five stars. There were just a few areas I described above that I thought the book could improve on.",
    "Expected more explanation of how people come to have there 'style attatchment' in the first place, understanding background would have made this much more enlightening for me",
    "I'm 33 and this is the first review I'm giving as it it beyond words how much I appreciate this book has been written.\nIf I had to name one single thing that was most helpful in emotional hardship, it would be this book!\nI'm just out of another painful breakup; but reading this book was really soothing and healing me from the recent experience, also from past disappointments and hopefully it will protect me from future ones.\nI realised that this partner was completely unsuitable for me, I even got almost grossed-out and appalled by his confusing behaviour, finally understanding that every single characteristic of it is a symptom of avoidant attachment style.\n\nIf I ever had a daughter, this book would be the first thing I'd give her \"on the way\" when she's a young adult.\nReading it made me finally understand why my past relationships with those people I \"loved\" very much were always so destructive. Eventually it turns out that it wasn't love but rather some unhealthy dynamics, a lot of confusion and pain through mixed messages by the other part, that caused me to constantly doubt and dwell on someone excessively, even after breaking up myself because I was so emotionally drained already.\n\nIf I had known earlier how to spot out and not attract these men that are unsuitable for me, I would probably not have wasted years with the wrong people and I'd be in a happy and stable relationship by now. It is so important to realise and understand these patterns.\n\nDon't confuse feeling anxious about someone with \"love\" !\nDon't let emotional unavailability turn you on!\nDon't get hooked on the hight& lows, on inconsistency of someone's affection.",
    "I read this book as I am going through a divorce and it was recommended to me by my therapist. Similar to the book 'He's Not That Into You', I found myself applying the attachment theory to more than just romantic relationships.\nThe lengthy amount of examples to really show how easy it is to pick out secure, anxious or avoiders really helped stress the clues to figuring people out. Taking the test at the beginning for myself then taking the test for my ex partner really showed how it was easy for things to go wrong between us.\nAm I now an expert? No. However, I feel there are a lot of things I will be applying to all relationships going forward.\nI would recommend buying this book in a hard copy as it requires you to sometimes flip back and forth and that was a bit difficult to do on my Kindle.",
    "I am anxiously attached and this has been an issue in almost all of my relationships. There were several times when I had lightbulb moments reading this book. I kept a journal while I read it and made notes throughout. I'm going to read it again so that I can better put the suggestions into practice. I wish that they discuss anxious-anxious relationships because I've been in a couple of those and found that I tend to get avoidant for whatever reason. But when I'm with an avoidant person (or even with a secure person in a long distance relationship, which I am at this moment) I become very anxious and preoccupied. I like how they include stories of other couples as examples. The entire book was very organized. That said, I feel that it could have been beefed up a bit with more examples of different situations. Otherwise, 5 stars."

    "It's not exactly a review but some thoughts after reading this book and observing current events.\n\nCan you imagine life being upended in a matter of weeks? You were forced to board a train to Auschwitz for a new life of unknowns. When you arrived, you were either directed to the left or to the right. You and your family were separated. You were instructed to go right while the rest of your family were instructed to go left. The life for the right group turned out to be half a decade of dehumanizing tortures. As for the left group, they were murdered within 24 hours of arrival to Auschwitz. You learned about the fate of the left group by realizing what all the smokes were rising above the structure your family went into. I was in shock and disbelief when I read about this in Man’s Search for Meaning but this crazy thing DID happen 80 years ago, just a few years before my parents were born. How could this world be so barbaric?\n\nBefore Auschwitz, most people were living a fairly normal life worrying about paying their bills, raising their family, advancing their careers, etc just like us ordinary beings today. People know there’s war but I doubt people thought about how they could be swallowed by the wars in a matter of weeks started by sinister people who only care about their own power. The whole thing is just insane and ridiculous and you would hope humanity learned its lessons. Nonetheless, 80 years later, we are back to square one. The war in Ukraine is ruthless and absurd. It destroyed a country where hardworking people falsely thought they could live in peace and prosperity. The Russian soldiers are asked to invade and to do cruel things Putin asked them to do: murdering, vandalizing, setting things on fire and destructing instructures that took years to build. I don’t think these Russian soldiers out of their own will would want to do this. What exactly is this evil power force making people do crazy and destructive things? Is it really just Putin? Or somehow our world allows this to happen.\n\nThis reminds me of the story Haruki Murakami wrote about his father. His father was forced to go to China to fight the war for Japan during WWII. He was a 19 year-old, having grown up in a Buddha temple in Kyoto. Despite the Buddhist teachings, he was forced to go to war by the government. His father witnessed the killing of Chinese prisoners of war and might even be forced to do the executions. Part of the military training at the time was for new soldiers to practice killing POW to get them into “the zone”, to become a competent fighter. His father told Murakami about this and this made a huge impression on him. He could sense his father was deeply affected by this experience for the rest of his life, with grief and guilt. After all, he was complicit. But he as an individual had no choice. If the government forced him to choose war, he could not choose peace instead. If the government goes completely insane, we as citizens have no recourse.\n\nAs I am typing this up, I am wondering how long the peaceful life we have in America would last. Three months ago most Ukrainian people probably couldn’t imagine what lay ahead. Should I worry about my family in Taiwan? Things can change drastically in a very short period of time. My husband and his family left Vietnam in 1982 to escape communism. They endured several years of communism rule and my father in law was jailed for a couple of years for “helping Americans”. Prior to the communist takeover, the family ran a large rice mill and owned a substantial amount of prime real estate in Saigon. Then Americans left. Overnight they lost all their assets to the communist regime. They went from a materially rich life to a life of hunger and partial homelessness. Young women had to hide to avoid being raped. My mother in law sold her gold jewelry in the black market to get her husband out of jail and the family escaped to America penniless. Who is responsible for all the sufferings? They did nothing wrong. They were hardworking people running an honest business. Perhaps they didn’t pay enough attention to international politics. But the price they had to pay was absurdly high.\n\nWe individuals are so small and powerless we don’t know what current of our crazy time can swallow us despite our innocence and futile efforts. The thought that we are in control is an illusion. When I think about the great suffering in Auschwitz, China, Vietnam and endless other man-made tragedies, I am so grateful for the peaceful time I still live in and whatever worries I have seem so trivial. If we strive for anything for the world, we should strive for peace.",
    "Part 1 of this book is a memoir, where Frankl describes (admittedly without a huge amount of detail) his experiences in several Nazi concentration camps between 1940 and 1945. It's every bit as tragic as you would imagine. Part 2 is where things get more interesting. Frankl employs all his knowledge as a psychologist and expert on the human brain to gain insight into these experiences. Why did the Nazis behave the way they did? How do such horrifying movements take root? Why did some prisoners give up, while others continued to fight and find meaning in their hellish experience?\n\nWhat makes this book great is that Frankl seems absolutely hell-bent on packaging all of this in such a way that you feel empowered to take on your own life's struggles. He succeeds. I'm still thinking about my own flawed perspectives on things, and working hard to employ the strategies he describes in this book.\n\nAre you in a dark place? Having an existential crisis? Wondering about the meaning of life? Read this book.",
    "I recently completed a master's in counseling and guidance and have been reading to find a set of books that will best address some of the disorders in the DSM-IV. Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a \"normal\" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.\n\nDepression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths\n* Book = \"Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity\"- David H. Rosen\"\no I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend \"The Essential Jung\" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.\n* Book = \"Man's Search for Meaning\" - Viktor Frankl\no I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered - and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.\n\nDepersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there\n* Book = \"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel\no Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we \"are\" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question if we are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the \"normal\" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.\n\nBipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program\n* Book = \"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness\" by Kay Redfield Jamison\no Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.\n\nADHD (attention deficit disorder)\n* Book = \"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It\" - Gabor Mate\no This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.\nOCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)\n* Book = \"Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\" - Ian Osborn\no Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.\n\nThat is all for now, but I am still reading",
    "THIS BOOK REVIEW IS ONLY BASED ON MY FEELINGS DURING READING THE BOOK. IT DOES NOT INTENT TO HURT ANYONE’S FEELINGS, AND DOES NOT MEANT TO COMPARE WITH ANY OTHER REVIEWER’S FEELINGS.\nWell writing a review for this kind of extraordinary book is a big audacity for me. however here I’m, trying to give some brief review of the book.\n\nThe book is basically divided into three parts, the first one describes the way the Jews prisoners were treated in the Nazi Concentration Camps and how their lifestyle was. In the second part, the author described the basics of Logotherapy, a way of treatment of the Psychotherapeutic Patients. And finally, in the third part, he described what he actually meant by Man’s Search for meaning.\n\nBeing a Jew, the author was transferred to the Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps during the Nazi occupation in Austria. Here, in the first part of the book, the author described his days in those concentration camps, where is were no chance of seeing the morning sun in the next day. And this happened every day. He described the way the SS guards used to treat the prisoners, the corruption prevailed in the camps, the malnutrition, the lifestyle of the camp Jews etc. The way he described the tortures the prisoners suffered, would surely bring tears to your eyes. During his description, he also pointed out the psychological condition of the other comrades in those camps. When most of the prisoners lost all hope of his life, some of them still kept the faith, that good days were coming.\n\nIn the second part, the author basically described the Logotherapy Techniques. And the most interesting part of the book is the third part. Here the author describes “Man’s search for meaning”. We, the human beings on this planet are living for a purpose. Until & unless we can’t find the purpose of our life, there is no reason for us to be here alive. Most of the prisoners in the camps lost all of their hopes and then died because they lost their purpose, as per the author. It is a must-read book for all I think.\n\nThe book also consists of few life-changing quotes which I liked in the book and would like to share:\n\n1. For success, like happiness, can’t be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.\n\n2. There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.\n\n3. Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great of little. Therefore the ‘size’ of human suffering is absolutely relative.\n\n4. No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.\n\n5. The human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.\n\n6. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life can’t be completed\n\n7. Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\n\n8. There is no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.\n\n9. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any ” how”.\n\n10. The body has fewer inhibitions than the mind.\n\n11. No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.",
    "The book says, ‘The Classic tribute to hope from Holocaust’. And Sir Frankl was a “Holocaust survivor\".\n\nThis book has two parts:\n1.Experiences in a Concentration Camp.\n2.Logotherapy in a Nutshell\n\nThe second part is so impactful and unique that you will re-read this book. The first part mainly is the autobiographical account of Sir, Frankl and the best part is both parts mutually support their credibility.\nThe way he has poured all the pain in this book is not so easy and that too after experiencing it, I was literally shocked because firstly, I was unaware of the term “Holocaust”, maybe I have read before somewhere in History but I was unaware while reading and Secondly, I had never come across something like this.\n\nHe has talked about everything related to life in this book and you know what the best part is even after so much pain, I felt sad but I wasn’t demotivated, I could relate it and with each page-turning, what I found was ‘I am into the book’, suffering all this but I wasn’t tackling all the worst situation in my life as he did.\nSuddenly I started understanding that what life is? what suffering is? and what surviving is? and where am I lacking?\n\nSo, in another way, I discovered the answer to three most important questions which I wanted to be answered since maturity.\n\nI came across a new word “Logotherapy” and I loved that section so much that I will re-read this book.\nIn one line, I learned a lot from this book, which I can further practice to live a peaceful and beautiful life ahead. And this what makes this book worth reading.",
    "Very moving book, in a kind of Dith Pran way... he is clearly mentally resilient and robust to find a way of dealing with the harsh conditions of a slaughter camp called Auschwitz, without being dehumanised. Two quotes really moved me \" if you can understand the why in your suffering, you can find the how in your suffering\". And after being released in 1945, although depersonalised by the awful conditions there, 3 weeks later he was able to say\" I give thanks to God who has led me to a spacious place\".. He reluctantly agreed to write a script which as we know became this book.\nAnyone who feels their life has no meaning or purpose, as our society has become increasingly Dickensian in the last 10 years, will find hope, as I did, to motivate myself to lead a fuller life, in spite of some of life's setbacks. I feel a winner, now, and am grateful for a special mentor who gave me her copy to learn wisdom.... I bought my own copy, as above to refer to it in times of stress. Other than that, it is a great read, which casts an objective eye on a period of history, some would rather forget.",
    "This is wonderful book, inspiring and wise. My uncle was taken by the Nazis and was almost dead due to typhus when the camp at Dachau was liberated. He was discovered in a heap of bodies by a doctor who noticed a flicker of his eyelids. He was taken to hospital in Budapest and survived until 1967. This book gave me an insight into what he must have suffered. He never complained was always cheerful and full of mischief. The second half of the book about logotherapy is also very interesting and worth reading.",
    "I knew that this book would be affecting and impactful, but I hadn’t actually realised how. I thought it would be a traumatic read, overly empathic response, too immersed in the emotive horrors.\n\nBut actually it’s a detached prose (insofar as a scientist who lives his unchosen experiment can write) which signifies the importance of finding meaning in life.\n\nIt’s like a really visual, visceral reminder that we can survive anything if we choose to. If we have our attitude reframed or we do it ourselves. If we see purpose or meaning in suffering, we cannot die.\n\nQuite a profound read that gave rise to new thinkings and questionings in my head, and which I intend to follow for my own personal development and flourishing but also as a path to teach others.\n\nThank you, for going through it, sharing it, understanding it."

    "It came recommended but without a warning. For me, its a must read to get an inside view of attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the US.

Many blessings to him.",

Don’t miss this story! He captures both the beauty and the horrors of the migrant experience.",
    "I applaud the brave nine year old and the man brave enough to look back on his journey. I applaud all the migrants with stories like this one. Stories like Javier's need to be told more often, and not only told, they need to be read and listened to. This book one day will be a classic.",

    "Great version of a classic! It’s really tough for kids to relate to the 1930s and to understand the Great Depression. It may be helpful to give a little synopsis of the storyline without giving away the ending. I also purchased a companion guide to help our chapter discussions.",
    "The story is short but has substance. I felt bad for George and Lennie but Gorge really tried his best. Well written short story.",
    "A must read classic. Not my first genre of choice but an important piece of literature to read and understand.",
    "Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, is a classic story written in the early 1900's. The story is based on two men and their struggle in life. One man, George, small in nature, looking over his large friend Lennie. This is a definite must read for anyone. This story is very popular and is frequently used as a beginner's read by many high schools across the nation.\nGeorge and Lennie first set out to find new jobs after being forced to flee from their current jobs. At first you are not told why they were fleeing but you knew from the dialect that something bad had occurred and Lennie was to blame. Lennie was a friendly, child-like dimwitted man. What he lacked in brain power he made up tenfold in brawny. He had a large muscular build which enabled him to be a good worker. George on the other hand, was the complete opposite of Lennie. He was small but definitely smarter than his counterpart Lennie. George looked out for Lennie and tried to keep him out of trouble, albeit an impossible task.\nWhile reading the story you inevitably know the ending before you even get there. At every turn you are expecting the well intended Lennie to do something horrible. George tries to keep him in line and is successful for most of the story.\nThe main idea is the search for happiness. George and Lennie are working to save enough money to buy their own land and work their own fields. George constantly reassures Lennie that they can achieve their goal and Lennie can have his rabbits to tend to. If Lennie ever slips up then George has to remind him of the future they intended.\nJohn Steinbeck has a tremendous ability to set up a visual representation of his story. In the beginning to every chapter, the landscapes and surroundings are vividly detailed making the reader actually believe he is there watching the events take place. Steinbeck follows his structure throughout the book. Each chapter sets up the scene and the conversations between characters tell the story for the remainder of the chapter.\nEach character in the story is well described. Always described upon first entering the story. Steinbeck also ensured that each person was flawed in some way. Each one had their good traits and their bad. George and Lennie seem to be the good guys in the story even though Lennie is a walking nightmare waiting to happen.\nYou can tell George and Lennie develop a loving relationship. Lennie listens to George and George in return keeps an eye on Lennie. This is definitely a heavy burden placed on George. Finally, in the end Lennie slips up. He kills the boss' daughter-in-law. The event that was being set up all along. A lynch party is sent out to find Lennie. Ultimately it is George that find Lennie. George is forced to kill Lennie for his discretions. Lennie died at the hand of George whilst being promised that brighter future yet another time.\nSteinbeck makes it seem as though we're all searching for that brighter future that's just out of our grasp. This is one of those books that you can't put down. Although it is not a long read, it is extremely well written.",
    "The positive side of this book: all of the content of the original book is in there.\nThe negatives: It's absurdly small and hard to even comfortably hold onto while reading. This book will appeal to people who are concerned with the amount of paper used for book printing; words are piled on the pages, making it a slim publication. It may also appeal to people who really want to confirm that bifocals are what they need to see very small print.\nThose seeking a comfy-to-hold book that doesn't give an instant headache trying to follow one jammed-in line to the next may be disappointed.",
    "This is another one of the classic works of American literature that is frequently assigned to high school students. As always, there are the idiotic 1-star non-reviews as a result, but compared to most other \"assignment\" books, relatively few compared with the 5-stars, so it must still hit a responsive chord in high school. Though I have been re-reading numerous high school \"assignment\" books, in order to judge how my impression changed over the decades, regrettably this was a first-time read for me, thanks to the encouragement of a fellow Amazon reviewer. I have read, and some cases re-read some of Steinbeck's other works, most notably  The Grapes of Wrath , as well as  Travels with Charley in Search of America , East of Eden (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)  and  Cannery Row: (Centennial Edition) . \"Of Mice and Men\" is set during The Great Depression, in California, and there are similarities between it and \"Grapes\" as well as \"Cannery,\" which also portray the \"down and out\" who are sometimes \"abstracted\" into terms such as \"surplus labor\" or \"lumpen proletariat.\"\n\nOne of the beauties of this book is that there is nothing \"abstract\" about Steinbeck's heart-rendering depiction of two \"drifters,\" Lenny and George, who move from farm to farm, as \"casual\" laborers, harboring dreams of being able to set just enough aside to get their own place, where they will be eternally happy. Seemingly an odd couple, Steinbeck describes a symbiotic relationship. Lenny is of barely functioning intellectual capacity, but has enormous strength. George is wiry, with the relative brains to take care of the two of them. The foreshadowing of ultimate doom occurs early, around the campfire along the river, as they discuss how they will act at the next farm, with George doing the talking.\n\nAt the farm, a small group of other characters is revealed. Perhaps the most interesting is Crooks, the only Black in the group, who endures the segregation and second class status due to his skin color that was all too prevalent as an \"acceptable fact\" during the 1930's. Curley is ugly and vicious, and very insecure, having married a \"tart,\" who still harbors her lost opportunities of making in big in the pictures. She taunts virtually all the men with her sexuality. Slim is the straw boss, and seems to fulfill that role admirably. And the amusements and diversions of migrant men are also depicted, in the trips into town when the work is done, and all the hard-earned money is frittered away on an evening's pleasure. An thus those dreams of a place of one's own all too often remain only that.\n\nAh... the ending is a fulfillment of that initial \"doom\" that was forecast, like an ancient Greek play. Utterly unforgettable. Throughout this rather short book, Steinbeck proves a master at furnishing the details that develop the characters. Sparse, while maintaining high dramatic tension. 5-stars, plus.",
    "I didn’t really know much about this book going in. The only reference I had of it was from ‘Lost’ when Sawyer and Ben mention it on the top of a mountain holding a bunny! I now get the reference!\nI don’t remember it being on the curriculum for school books, but when I was researching the category of ‘a classic you didn’t read in school’ this came up.\nAs I’ve said many times I’m not a big fan of ‘classic’ books, they usually seem non-sensical, and I can’t usually follow them. So, I chose this because it was short and I wouldn’t have to suffer for too long.\nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. It was simply written, easy to follow and straightforward in its storyline.\nThe characters were likeable, although there are a lot to remember and most beginning with the letter C. So they did become a little inter-mixed, and I’d have to stop and remember who everyone was.\nIt wasn’t overly descriptive, as there is a lot of dialogue. I loved the representation of the dialect; this really made it feel as if you were on the ranch with them listening to them chew the fat!\nI even teared up a little at the end (and during with the dogs), but I wasn’t expecting the outcome, and it was really sad.\nSo this was a pleasant surprise of a read. I read it fast as it was so easy and had a relaxed style of writing.",
    "My daughter had to buy this book for her English Literature GCSE Exam and she told me it was very convenient. The pages that summarise the chapter helped her find the main points she needed to revise for her exams. They were also a useful way to go back and remember what happened without having to re-read the entire chapter.\n\nThere were questions at the end of the book that you could answer that helped her to understand the context, content, author and characters better.\n\nMy daughter tells me Of Mice and Men is a detailed and intricate story written in the 1930s by John Steinbeck. It tells the story of George and Lennie, two migrant ranch workers, sharing a dream of one day owning their own ranch and also their struggle of trying to survive due to lack of money. The book also includes the most important issues regarding society in America during the great depression which were my daughters GCSE topics for this novel such as racism, sexism, prejudice and the American Dream. It is a highly thought provoking story wherein the simplest of sentences has a profound deeper meaning.\n\nOverall it’s a very good book with useful summarised pages and questions that make it easy to understand and use as a revision tool for GCSE English Literature. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who either is doing this for their GCSEs or has a teenager that is.",
    "Before you finish the first page you realise that you’re reading an authentic poetic piece of literature. As with other John Steinbeck works, his recognition and homage to hard economic times in America, and the transient workforce is so subtly and vividly portrayed.\n\nLennie and George are two immortal characters that live well beyond the pages of this book. It is a heart-breaking story of loyalty and love, of friendship and society, and of hope and despondency. Lennie is the main discussion point in the book and it is such a sad story about the impact of a serious personality disorder, and how it can have devastating consequences to the person and those around them. I did, however, think a lot about George and how he had enabled the friendship to grow and how he tried to provide a protective shield around Lennie. He was constantly driving Lennie to remember statements he needed to recite if challenged or actions he needed to follow if confronted. They dreamed and talked constantly about the smallholding they had been saving for. They would have different crops and animals (particularly rabbits for Lennie) and be masters of their own domain. Life can be cruel when hope and aspirations can be dashed with an unforeseen event and twist of fate.\n\nThe story does have a sexist feel to it in the sense that the woman (no name) was the downfall of Lennie and was only ever referred to as Curley’s wife. There is an inference that she was Curley’s possession and perhaps her behaviour was to illustrate she was not the possession of one, but free to be with many.\n\nGeorge showed sincere and deep love for Lennie in resolving the issue in a way which was best for Lennie while leaving himself with remorse, guilt and loss for the rest of his life.\n\nWhy oh why did it take me so long to read this book – don’t make the same mistake.",
    "Of Mice and Men is the story of George and Lennie. They work various jobs and travel around looking for new work as one job runs out or they run out. The story begins as they head towards their next job. George has a dream to one day own his own plot of land and Lennie is happily caught up in this vision of the future. Lennie is a gentle giant of a man and is referred to as being not very bright but will work hard and do as he is told.\n\nGeorge looks out for Lennie and knows that many would not want a man like Lennie working for them, prejudice at this point in history is ripe so anyone being slightly different is not acceptable to many. Even though George is often frustrated by the simple nature of Lennie, he is a friend and will support him. They are each other has.\n\nThis is a simple tale of friendship between two men travelling for work. Rather than being loners as many travelling labourers are, they have a bond in their friendship, they are able to talk about their dreams for the future and it gives them hope. George tries his best to keep Lennie out of trouble, but this is not always possible and misunderstandings do happen.\n\nThis is a quick read at only 121 pages and is easy to read in one sitting. It’s style is one I like, a slow meandering yet descriptive and emotional one. It explores various inequalities and prejudices that were relevant at the time. A wonderful read that slowly rolls along until it picks up speed as a sense of tension begins to build.\n\nThis is a book I would recommend to readers who enjoy American Social History, Literary Fiction and Classic Fiction.",
    "The best laid plans of men and mice often go awry.\n\nSuch a short book, only 112 pages, but its powerful.\n\nNot an awful lot happens, the pace is slow, your strolling. Your meet George, Lennie, spend two days together and finish where you started but I'm sure you wont feel the same.\n\nI didnt expect much from this novella, total credit to Steinback, he has created a lot in very few words. In fact I've read much longer books that will prove to be less memorable.\n\nThis is a definite cigarettes and whiskey kind of book and well worth reading."

    "“Sloppiness, errors, biased conclusions, and even outright fraud had become so prevalent in scientific research that a staggeringly high percentage of research papers—up to 85 percent in some fields—reached radically wrong conclusions. And the most fascinating thing of all, from a psychological point of view: Most researchers were utterly convinced they were conducting their research more or less correctly. Somehow, they failed to realize that their research was not bringing them closer to the facts but instead was creating a fictitious new reality.’’\n\nNow, I’ve recently read several books about this problem. It’s well known to scientific, academic world.\n\nBut, why connect to totalitarianism?\n\n“This, of course, is a serious problem, especially for contemporary societies that place their faith in science as the most reliable way of understanding the world.’’\n\n‘Faith in science’ is the cause of . . .\n\n“. . . problem is directly related to the phenomenon of totalitarianism. In fact, this is precisely what Arendt exposes: The undercurrent of totalitarianism consists of blind belief in a kind of statistical-numerical “scientific fiction” that shows “radical contempt for facts”: “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction and the distinction between true and false no longer exist.”\n\nFrom ‘science’ to ‘science fiction’. So . . . so . . . sad.\n\n“The poor quality of scientific research reveals a more fundamental problem: Our scientific worldview has substantial shortcomings, the consequences of which extend far beyond the field of academic research. These shortcomings are also the origin of a profound collective unease, which, in recent decades, has become increasingly palpable in our society. People’s view of the future is now tainted with pessimism and lack of perspective, more so everyday. Should civilization not be washed away by rising sea levels, then it certainly will be swept away by refugees. The Grand Narrative of society—the story of the Enlightenment—no longer leads to the optimism and positivism of yesteryear, to put it mildly.’’\n\n‘Grand narrative’ from the enlightenment has broken down.\n\nAnd this is key theme here. He credits Hannah Arendt for this insight. In fact, this work uses her book as foundation. Nevertheless, Desmet writes like a journalist, not like Arendt, who is a philosopher.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n“However, from the beginning, the tree of science also sprouted a branch in another direction—the exact opposite direction of that original scientific practice. Based on the great achievements of science, some people tipped from open-mindedness to belief; for them, science became ideology.’’\n\nChanged from an open mind to closed belief. Right.\n\n“It was mainly the mechanistic-materialistic branch, the so-called hard sciences, that most enraptured us. Simple in its principles (the laws of mechanics), specific in its object (the tangible, visible world), and awe-inspiring in its practical applicability (from the steam engine to television and the atomic bomb to the Internet), this science has everything to seduce human beings. With this branch of science, man conquers space; it enables us to see and hear what is happening on the other side of the planet and visualize brain activity; it gives us the ability to move faster than sound and to perform microsurgical procedures. In the past, people waited in vain for God to perform miracles, but this science made them actually happen. Man had left the stage of believing and could now rely successfully on what he knew. At least, so he believed.’’\n\nLeft belief and found certainty! Wow!\n\nHow bad is this?\n\n“To the extent that the scientific discourse became an ideology, it lost its virtue of truth-telling. Nothing illustrates this better than the so-called replication crisis that erupted in academia in 2005. This crisis emerged when a number of serious cases of scientific fraud came to light. Scientific scans and other imaging were proven to have been manipulated, archaeological artefacts were found to be counterfeit, embryo clones had been forged;8 some researchers claimed to have successfully transplanted skin from mice, whilst they had simply dyed the skin of the test animals without performing any surgical procedure. Other researchers had manufactured missing links from pieces of skulls of humans and monkeys; and yes, it appeared that some even completely made up their research.’’\n\nPublic not (yet) aware of this disgrace. What will be damage when absorbed?\n\nWhat about scientific ‘facts’?\n\n“By attempting to measure the unmeasurable, measurement becomes a form of pseudo-objectivity. Instead of bringing the researcher closer to his research object, the measurement procedure leads him further away. It hides the examined object behind a screen of numbers.’’\n\nFalse objectivity. True deceit.\n\nPART I Science and Its Psychological Effects   \n1  Science and Ideology\n2:  Science and Its Practical Applications   \n3:  The Artificial Society   \n4:  The (Im)measurable Universe   \n5:  The Desire for a Master\n\nPART II Mass Formation and Totalitarianism   \n6: The Rise of the Masses   \n7: The Leaders of the Masses   \n8: Conspiracy and Ideology\n\nPART III Beyond the Mechanistic Worldview   \n9:  The Dead versus the Living Universe\n10:  Matter and Spirit\n11:  Science and Truth\n\nWhat about trusting the ‘numbers’?\n\n“The German philosopher Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for his uncertainty principle—“It’s not a matter that we’re not yet sure now; the point is that we can never be sure”—but we don’t like it. If the data don’t provide certainty yet, we’ll collect more. In this way, as a society, we are mesmerized by an endless procession of numbers and never arrive at what really matters: an open debate about the subjective and ideological frameworks from which we interpret the numbers.’’\n\nAll numbers must . . . always . . . be interpreted!\n\n“It is the unspoken tensions, fears, and disagreements on an ideological level that prevent the numbers from settling down and that makes society polarize. The real questions to be asked are situated at the ideological level. For instance: Do we view man as a biochemical machine that has to be technologically monitored and pharmaceutically adjusted, or as a being that finds its destination in mystical resonance with the Other and with the eternal language of nature?’’\n\nHuge difference. Are we machines or sons of God? Creates two completely different understandings.\n\nWhat can be done to dig for deeper insight?\n\n“The first and foremost guideline for members of this third group is that they should let their voices be heard and in as sincere a way as possible so as to not let the resonance of the dominant, hypnotic voice become absolute. The way in which this can happen varies throughout the process of totalitarianism (the dissident voice is progressively more censored and banned from mass media and from the public sphere), but there always remain opportunities. The assertion of a different voice always has an effect on the other two groups. As Gustave Le Bon described in the nineteenth century, dissonant voices (i.e., the voices of the third group) usually do not succeed in breaking through the hypnosis of the first group, but it does reduce the depth of the hypnosis and prevent the masses from committing atrocities. Also, the leaders prove sensitive to the dissonant voices, which is what we described in the previous chapter where we referred to the “waking up” of the Nazi leaders who were deployed to Denmark and Bulgaria. Asserting one’s voice should typically be done in the calmest and most respectful way possible, never in an intrusive way and always with sensitivity to the irritation and anger it may generate but with determination and persistence.’’\n\n(Recalls Peter’s direction . . .\n\n“ . . . always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.’’)\n\nWhat’s Desmet’s conclusion?\n\n“The journey of science does not end in superior knowledge but in a kind of Socratic modesty. A human who has traveled this journey far enough knows better—he just knows—that all rational knowledge is relative and remains alien to the essence of the object he is trying to understand. At the end of this journey awaits an encounter with something that cannot be grasped with logic and rationality. The great minds of science have testified to such encounter in many different ways. Albert Einstein liked to talk about the elusive mystery that he found everywhere in the universe and about the wonderful structure of reality. Niels Bohr understood that poetry has more grip on all things Real than logic. And Max Planck said that all matter is grounded in a conscious and intelligent Mind that holds the fate of the world and every human being in its almighty hand.’’\n\nI agree.\n\nThis is an important book. I didn’t provide the many connections Desmet makes to the ‘scientific’ reaction to the pandemic.\n\nOutstanding. Fascinating. Insightful. Important.\n\nDeserves ten stars!\n\nHundreds and hundreds of notes (linked)\n\nMany linked to references.\n\nTremendous scholarship!\n\nFrom blurb about author . . .\n\n“Mattias Desmet is recognized as the world’s leading expert on the theory of mass formation as it applies to the COVID-19 pandemic. He is a professor of clinical psychology in the Department of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University (Belgium) and a practicing psychoanalytic psychotherapist.’’",
    "Absolutely brilliant. Not only is this work critical to understanding the dynamics of what is occurring in the world today, Desmet has achieved the rare feat of making a deeply intellectual discussion thoroughly practical. (I also must say that Desmet’s writing is a thing of beauty. Despite its weighty subject matter and mind-blowing implications, it was a pure pleasure to read.)\n\nSure. This book might not be the political tome that some hoped for. However, political tomes are a dime a dozen. This analysis, by contrast, is foundational. Indeed, part of the angst (for lack of a better word) caused by the global pandemic response, both by governments and the masses, is that none of the observed phenomena can be understood, at all, through politics. Yet here we are.\n\nThere’s a great deal of hope in the truth that totalitarian regimes always implode and that remaining (or becoming) a dissident can at least slow the advent of atrocities. That fact is not chopped liver. Rather, it’s wonderfully liberating for those who accept it. We can’t crush the regime (global or local). Nor can we “take back” anything. That is fact. Once the totalitarian regime is established, it must exhaust and extinguish itself. On the other hand, we are not powerless. Our honorable and effective contribution to the implosion process is to remain dissident, hold ground, and remember that even little acts of speaking out are poignant and magnified in these times.\n\nIndeed, internalizing the fact that all your “little” acts of speaking truth do make a tremendous difference to the lifecycle of the totalitarian regime is exhilarating.\n\nWhile much of the analysis here is set out as the mass vs. the truth-speakers, in a more primitive sense it’s the fearful vs. the fearless. Specifically, those who dreadfully fear death vs. those who, for whatever reason, don’t. (Not that any of us are free of fear, but the old adage applies: courage isn’t the absence of fear, it’s the determination to keep going anyway.)\n\nBut this shows up a terrible irony. Clearly, there is an inverse relationship between fear and compassion. This inversion is at its zenith when it regards death. The more a person is whipped up to fear his own death, the less compassion he has on the dying. See seniors dying alone, without even any human touch, and no one within the mass cared. The response to children forcibly being carried off and “prophylactically” imprisoned. Much worse scenarios could be stated. The fear-generated lack of compassion becomes ruthless on every level.\n\nDr. McCullough talks often about the crisis of compassion among doctors and health care workers during the pandemic, at times to the point that he shed tears. The anti-human policies that were accepted are a testament to the power wielded through mass fear. A doctor who is part of the mass is suddenly psychologically able to hard-heartedly tell patients “no, you’re not allowed to even try that medicine,” even if the patient is dying and, under non-mass circumstances, the doctor would have been quick to prescribe that med for off-label use.\n\nAs fear burgeons and becomes the organizing principle of the mass, compassion plummets. Multiply that times a million individuals in various positions of power and authority—all in an intensely enforced positive feedback loop—and the mass becomes ruthless and brutal indeed.\n\nThus, it should come as no shock that those who integrate into the mass fear are stripped of their humanity first. Then they strip the Other.\n\nBut, again, the good news here is that no matter how overwhelming the mass may appear, history proves its vulnerabilities. There’s value in buying time and delaying the atrocities. There’s moral and practical value in speaking the truth in ways large and small, matter-of-factly declining to go along, in love, in living without fear of death. Light, no matter how small, does extinguish darkness. Thank you, Professor Desmet.",
    "This book is very well written and provides excellent examples of the points the author is trying to make. I always wondered how Hitler, Stalin and Mao were able to convince millions of people to go along with their evil plans. In the end, it is fundamental human psychology that 30% will believe a complete lie, 50% will follow along with the lie knowing that it is wrong and only about 20% will resist the lie. With odds like that, any organization or government is doomed to failure when the wrong leadership is in charge. The antidote to a lie is the truth, but society needs freedom of speech and the press to get the truth out there. As a U.S. citizen, I am proud of our constitution and what our founders tried to establish. Up till now our leaders tried to stick to these fundamentals. Our government has been corrupted over the years to the point where there is no branch left that does not rule by lies, with a willing press and big tech media to help spread the lies and squash the truth. Private corporations and academia have jumped on the bandwagon. Unfortunately we can see where this is all going and dear old Abe Lincoln will get an answer to his Gettysburg Address .... Government of the people, by the people and for the people .... Will perish from this earth.",
    "The book has a good description about the development of mass formation in society and explains why so many people have been caught up in the mainstream COVID narrative. However I strongly disagree on his assertion that there was no coordination behind the events that took place. In fact I cannot believe that an academic would make such a blatant blunder in his reasoning. There have been protocols developed over hundreds if not thousands of years about how to deal with a possible contagion. None of that was followed by the vast majority of countries in the world, it would be normal to stop infected people entering an uninfected area, it is normal to quarantine the sick not the healthy, a symptomatic transmission is a very rare event, not something that should take centre stage and warrant useless PCR testing. I could go on and on..... Combining this with Event 201, and the Rockefeller Lockstep document, I thing there is enough strong evidence to show intent, and those involved. However academics rarely know the meaning of \"always learning but never knowing.\" They never seem to question the origins of the mortar board they wear at a degree ceremony. So that leads to the question, has material been left out intentionally or is it simply a case of lack of knowledge ? Overall, its still a good book to read, as long as the reader doesn't give the author \"god like\" status and maintains their own critical reasoning abilities!",
    "Mattias Desmet's contribution to understanding the nature of the collective mind is incredibly grounded and immediately accessible. A profound book for our time, which everyone would benefit from reading.",
    "This really is an important book.\nIt's great value is that it offers an alternative explanation to stupidity with which to make sense of the immense cruelty and irresponsibility of so many compliant people towards the vulnerable, children and the elderly. I guess it's marginally better to be a hypnotised society than a cruel and abusive one. The book will enable more of us to wake up and challenge the biggest crime ever committed.",
    "A must read for everyone. Couldn’t put it down. It read like a thriller, yet is absolutely non fiction.\nDesmet writes in an easy and engaging way. I have been following his work for the past 7 months and was highly anticipating the English version of his book. If you think totalitarianism is a thing of the 20th century and could never happen again, think again.\n\n‘One who knows the limits of his intellect usually becomes less arrogant and more humane, more capable of allowing the other to be different.’",
    "In this short book Mattias Desmet sums up why so many people are behaving in such dangerously strange ways. He clearly explains that many people are in the grip of powerful group hypnosis and how that has spread around the modern world. I can't recommend highly enough that you read it."

    "the victim makes a demand of those around them.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy’s new book, “Nation of Victims”, is full of bold, common sensible statements like this, found in his opening chapter. He goes on to give personal examples, well know public examples and trace the history of racial victimization. The careful inquiry of Sally Hemings, Thomas Jefferson’s concubine/slave, shows how presenting the totality of a story can change the significance completely. We must not cancel our history no matter how unpleasant it is. By reading the whole story, Sally moves from rape victim slave to ferocious mother, hero negotiator and emancipator in waiting; quite the difference and one currently not learned by students because of CRT.\n\nVivek makes a strong case that looking for reparations is feeding the victim mentality. His chapter on CRT should be read by everyone who has children, is thinking about having them or cares about our education system. Here again, he traces this subject from its earliest historical manifestation; extremely informative.\n\nEveryone is taken to task in this book. Ramaswamy is a straight shooter and calls foul to conservatives and liberals equally. His mission is to inspire citizens to desire excellence and a spirit of national pride once again. Victim mentality has permeated philosophy, become a way of life and made for lazy people. Physical labor has almost disappeared for outsourcing, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs from middle America. We need to take back American pride, not import some low quality/cost stuff on a freighter with all the intendant issues.\n\nHow we accomplish this is an interesting discussion by Vivek. He looks at Roman history and the parallels to contemporary America are amazing. That’s why we shouldn’t cancel history. We need to learn from the good parts and the bad making sure to emulate where appropriate and avoid the same.\n\nVivek gets very personal sharing about Hindi beliefs of reincarnation and applying them to remaking our nation. It’s obvious how much he cares and that this is more than just 70K words in a book. This is a well tho’t out book that’s reasoned, fair, provoking and causing me to ponder. His ideas on raising taxes after death on the Uber rich are pure genius.\n\nMake a demand of yourself. Bring an open mind to this book. Read it, share it and pray to restore our country back to meritocracy and excellence📚",
    "Makes a valid argument on the dangers of our current politics focusing on identity versus a person's actual achievements.",
    "My wife and I both have enjoyed this book immensely, having said that some of his insights are hard to take but so is bitter medicine. I have often talked about “bread and circuses “ and you know you always like it when someone says the same thing. His talk about how conservatives are getting into the victim mode is distributing but after some thought I have to agree with him. The other thing that I already have noticed is the unwillingness of people to go back to work. Again we have really enjoyed listening to this book. Highly recommend!",
    "Nation of Victims lives up to the hype; and the\nattention surrounding Vivek Ramaswamy and this second book following Woke Inc. is well\ndeserved. In Nation of Victims, Vivek makes a\ncompelling case surrounding the death of merit\nand the need to revive a culture of excellence.\nImportantly, this is communicated in a POSITIVE way that can be unifying to our country. Clearly and effectively written.",
    "Vivek is one of the most important thinkers America has to offer today. This works is no different in that regard than his previous works. People are responsible for taking ownership of their own lives. This should not be a controversial idea. But in a nation where everyone is a victim and the State is savior, it is tantamount to heresy.",
    "Great book to understand the characteristics of victimhood and the foundation of woke culture — and how some individuals weaponize resentment to perpetuate a preferred critical narrative….",
    "So insightful and honest!",
    "Wow! I did not think Vivek’s next book would be as good as Woke Inc. It was better!! He’s quickly growing into a prominent thought leader in America. I’m sure there is more to come."

    "”Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,” by Ray Dalio, explains why the United States succeeded in becoming the dominant country in the world. It also explains why the United States is in decline, and more ominously, why Communist China is ascending.\n\nDalio’s book is refreshingly free of the ideological biases that often distort an explanation like this. Typically one blames what is universally deplored on what one personally dislikes. Howard Ruff’s “How to Prosper During the Coming Bad years,” was published in 1979, when everyone was worried about inflation.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UE3ODN950AAJ?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp\n\nRuff blamed the stagflation of the late 1970’s on welfare spending (he included Social Security and Medicare as welfare) and the sexual revolution. Most Republicans took the lead of Milton Friedman, and blamed Keynesian economic policies. Republicans had never liked Keynesian economic policies because those policies shifted wealth, power, and prestige from the business community to the government.\n\nI blame the stagflation of the 1970’s on rise on the world price of petroleum that followed the OPEC Oil Embargo of 1973, and the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Keynesian economic policies were not designed to respond to the shortage of a natural resource essential the the U.S. economy. Moreover, during the Great Depression the problem was deflation, not inflation. Republicans did not want to blame the OPEC Oil Embargo and the Iranian Revolution because they did not want to admit that foreigners they disliked had considerable control over the U.S. economy, and they did not want to admit that America’s reliance on automobile transportation was a national problem.\n\nRay Dialio sees the growing income gap as a problem. Because he is a self made billionaire investor who has made more money than Howard Ruff knows exists, he his opinions about economic inequality cannot be dismissed as “the politics of envy.”\n\nDialio’s main concern is with the rise of China and the decline of the United States. He also discusses how the Netherlands and Great Britain passed through the same cycle he claims that China and the United States are passing through. He mentions earlier nations which previously dominated the West, or the world. These include Macedonia, Rome, the Arabs, the Mongols, China, and the Ottoman Turks. With the exception of China, these never regained world dominance after they lost it.\n\nDialio claims that dominant nations go through six stages:\n\n“Stage 1, when the new order begins and the new leadership consolidates power;”\n\n“Stage 2, when the resource – allocation system system and government bureaucracies are built and refined.”\n\nIn the first two states the people of a soon to become dominant nation interact harmoniously. They work hard, save their money, and stay out of debt personally, and nationally. Those who perform well are rewarded, but economic inequality does not reach high levels.\n\n“Stage 3, when there is peace and prosperity.” During this time the descendants of those who lived through the first two stages become less interested in saving money and more interested in spending it, and enjoying life.\n\n“Stage 4, when there are great excesses in spending and debt, and the widening of wealth and political gaps.”\n\n“Stage 5, when there are very bad financial conditions and intense conflict,” and finally,\n\n“Stage 6, when there are civil wars/revolutions.”\n\nDalio believes that China is passing from Stage 2 to Stage 3, and that the United States is in Stage 5.\n\nThis scenario does not explain the American Revolution and the American Civil War. Neither was preceded by bad economic times. Efforts by the British Parliament to make the colonists pay their share of the costs of the French and Indian War were irritating to the colonists, but not impoverishing. The British victory in the French and Indian War created economic opportunities for the colonists.\n\nSimilarly, the decade leading up to the American Civil War was not a time of economic decline and distress. Few whites in the North would benefit economically by freeing the slaves. Most whites in the South would benefit economically if the slaves were freed. Family farms in the South could not compete with plantations worked by slaves. Nearly every skilled trade and profession paid less in the slave states than in the free states.\n\nNevertheless, more Americans died during the American Civil War than in all the other wars the United States has fought. The American Revolution and the American Civil War happened for reasons not explained in this book. Moreover, the Netherlands and Great Britain never passed into Stage 6. Nevertheless, Dalio’s postulated sequence does seem to explain what has been happening to China and the United States.\n\nChina is the only nation that has recovered from national declines. He provides a chart that shows that a cycle happened in each Chinese dynasty. I think another reason the dynasties rose and fell was because of problems inherent with the dynastic principle. Dynasties have been established by men who are charismatic, effective political leaders, and military geniuses.\n\nWith each generation the man who inherits the throne is likely to be progressively less talented than the man who created it. This is due to a well understood genetic phenomenon called “reversion to the average.” Exceptional characteristics are caused by rare and recessive gene alleles that are unlikely to match in the children of exceptional parents.\n\nThe Chinese benefit from a characteristic not mentioned in this book. Everywhere they live Chinese tend to be intelligent, obedient to the law, and monogamous. This is true even when they are poor and persecuted.\n\nThis gives the Chinese nation the ability to recover quickly from the bad decisions of incompetent leaders. It enables them to respond quickly to the good decisions of competent leaders, like they are doing now.\n\nThis also gives the Chinese nation an advantage over a multi racial country like the United States. We include races with average characteristics not conducive to creating and maintaining successful societies and civilizations. When the United States was ascending, ninety percent of the population was white. Most blacks were restricted to second class citizenship, despite the obvious intentions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n\nWhile the Chinese are perfecting their meritocracy we are using affirmative action programs to achieve diversity, inclusion, and equity. These in turn advance people to positions where they are unable to perform adequately. While Chinese geneticists are looking for gene alleles that influence intelligence, we pretend that the assertions in “The Bell Curve,” are pseudo science, and that “Race is only a social construct.”\n\nDiversity is not our strength: it is the main reason for the political polarization that makes it difficult for us to solve problems that would have been manageable before 1964.\n\nLike every sensible American, and unlike the insensible Americans I sometimes encounter on the internet, I hope America avoids a civil war or a revolution.\n\nI also expect China to achieve world hegemony by the end of this century, if not sooner. I hope that by the time this happens the Chinese mainland will have adopted a democratic government. The success of democracy in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan persuades me that democracy would work well on the mainland.\n\nMy love for the Chinese people and culture, although not for the present dictatorship, makes me sanguine about a world dominated by a democratic China.",
    "In this book, Dalio presents his model of the rise and fall of \"empires\". The closer it gets to the present day the more interesting the book is. The last three chapters of the book which deal with the rise of China, the current tensions between China and the US, the United States's alleged decline and Dalio's conjectures regarding the future are five stars. The build up to the final three chapters is decent, although only occasionally riveting: The book is only three stars before the strong close.\n\nIt is hard to evaluate the merits of Dalio's historical model given that he is only presenting it at moderate depths so as to introduce it all in one volume. The model says that empires rise and fall, no surprise, and talks about the interplay of economic, internal, and external factors that take an empire through the cycle. Dalio also mentions that inside the Big Cycle there are other cycles, and inside those cycles other cycles. He does not, however, go into much detail regarding the sub-cycles. This sounds reminiscent of Robert Prechter's Elliot Waves or perhaps, even, pre-Copernican astrology. Is this a model so loose, like Elliot Waves, that it can be found to fit anything that could happen? Is it falsifiable? Along the way was the validity tested by approaching an empire that there was little prior knowledge of to make \"forward predictions\" regarding what would happen? Has Dalio merely cherry picked the three examples which best seem to demonstrate the soundness of the model while omitting more problematic cases? There is not enough in this book to do a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe United States Civil War is a good example of something I had trouble thinking about in terms of the model. According to the model the final stage in an empire's breakdown is civil war or revolution. In the case of the United States, however, the Civil War occurred while the United States was still ascendant: in stage 2 out of 6 with stage 3 being the peak. Certainly there was no debt crisis which caused the Civil War and the United States had little going on in terms of external conflict at the time. So perhaps that could have been taken as a \"prediction\" that the United States would almost certainly have survived the Civil War in tact? The truth, however, is that the South came very close to winning the Civil War, in the sense of being recognized as independent, according to McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom.\n\nAnother thing that I am not sure how to evaluate using the model is the United States after the Civil War and after the Revolution. Although these were periods of rebuilding they do not seem to fit well into Dalio's model. After victory in these conflicts Americans were very magnanimous (as it was later after World War II). Far from being purged those who were on the wrong side of history ended up facing rather little in the way of consequences. So how does this fit into the model? Obviously, there will be some \"rebuilding\" after a Revolution or Civil War so is the model just saying there will be something which could not not happen? Indeed although the United States was vibrant after the Revolution, the period after the Civil War as described in Richard White's The Republic for Which it Standards seems in decline compared to the Antebellum period. According to Dalio's model, however, the United States was stage 2 rising into stage 3 during this period.\n\nRegardless of the merits of the model, which would probably require many in depth books to evaluate fully, there is definitely some good high level overviews of Chinese, European, and American history. There are many interesting charts and statistics thrown in.\n\nAs mentioned, the close of the book is far and away the best part of it. Dalio describes the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese people and their different outlooks toward governing. Dalio does not seem to be pushing any political agenda, at least not too hard, but rather what he has carefully measured to be objectively true. Although clearly an admirer of much about China, he is also willing to criticize some aspects of China. At the same time, his criticism omits its surveillance state.\n\nLooking forward Dalio presents some very interesting charts and statistics regarding America's growing internal conflicts. He even has a graph to show how bad it is now compared to early points in history. Dalio is willing to stick his neck out and quantify what his model is predicting as the probability of civil war in the United States and the probability of military war with China in the next decade.\n\nAlthough very thought provoking overall, one particularly persistent problem throughout the book is that many of the charts are very hard to read. There are graphs with eight different lines with some of the colors very hard to distinguish between. The book also almost never references its sources. Indeed, given how much history Dalio has obviously studied, a bibliography, or at least a list of recommendations, would be very nice.\n\nDalio is very repetitive regarding the inevitable death of fiat currencies through money printing. At the same time he also does provide concrete advise of how to prepare. He gives some definite timelines and the dates are very close. To qualify this, somewhat, however, his company Bridgewater Associates has basically had a \"lost decade\" using his models to generate any kinds of returns since his departure around 2012. Nevertheless it is interesting to think about whether or the US is on the verge of multiple simultaneous crises.",
    "I bought this book because I admire Ray's views in his book Principles.\nI read Changing World Order twice, analyzing and thinking over many passages and charts.\nHere is my short opinion:\na) the first part of the book \"How the world works\", I thought, gives an excellent overview of the history of the world, and the dynamics between world powers\nb) the 2nd and the 3rd part of the book appears to show Ray's heavy admiration towards China with hand-picked evidence to support his case.\nHere is why I think so:\na) In dozens of passages, Ray appears to focus on some negative dynamics in the US and not discuss similar negative dynamics in China.\nIn other words, Ray doesn't seem to compare apples to apples in the narrative.\nb) When looking at the charts, Ray appears vague about the data on which some charts were built.\nI couldn't judge the validity of the chart because I didn't see what went into the compound data shown in the chart.\nThere are so many examples of this in each chapter that it made me doubt the validity of 2/3 of the content I'm reading, let alone the conclusions Ray is drawing.

    "Another master piece by Ray. Personally I believe this book is great, but not limited for:\n- building a fundation of understanding the waves of cycles and developments\n- gaining a different thought prospect when observing events\n- learning how to put together an effective system for research and study",
    "He estudiado ciencias políticas y economía toda mi vida y nunca he leído tantas imprecisiones juntas . Si te interesa la coherencia, lógica o rigor, te vas a equivocar con este libro. En vez encontrarás muchas referencias a “causas y efectos\" (desconocidos por los demás), “mega movimientos sociales y económicos (\"cuyos rasgos solo se pueden describir grandes pinceladas”), “mi profundo conocimiento de la historia de los imperios”, “mi gran experiencia como inversor” etc. En otras palabras fuera de muchos conceptos que solo él dice que puede descifrar, aquí no vas a encontrar mucho mas de rigor científico o interés.",
    "While the past has been accurately examined, the enormous contingencies we are witnessing the last three years makes me doubt on the future vision. There are many avalanches at sight that might profoundly change current practices to deal with climate change, domestic energy sources, military spending, food production and health care. Current social institutions are not responding fast enough to all these exploiting unattended concerns of the whole population."

    "I'm far from 100% sold on the ideas Zeihan presents, but the massive amount of knowledge he brings to the table automatically earns this book five stars.\n\nThe challenge of this book for me is trying to judge Zeihan's views on a plethora of issues I know little about. But there was one issue I did feel I could judge somewhat. As a retired engineer I read things now and then about energy issues, and it is clear to me that there is a great deal of ignorance on the part of climate activists as to the capability of alternative energy technology which exists today to be deployed in a manner which allows fossil fuels to be phased out, without reverting the human race to a stone age existence. Zeihan passed the test in that regard, because it was clear he himself is keenly aware of those limitations. (examples being the intermittency of renewable electricity sources, the very limited extent of energy storage technology to mitigate that intermittency, the problems with electric-powered transportation (mining, recycling of batteries, etc), and the fact that fossil fuels are not just used as an energy source but are used heavily as ingredients for the production of a myriad of materials such as plastic, fertilizer, asphalt, concrete, etc. which are essential to modern civilization. So the one item I felt I could competently grade Zeihan on he gets an A.\n\nTaking a broader look at what's in this book I believe the key theme is the contention that 1). The globalized economy that exists today has ushered in a golden age of economic growth for the human race. 2). The conditions that enabled the globalized economy no longer exist. 3). Therefore, the world economy will de-globalize in the coming years. 4). De-globalization will have huge consequences for the nations of the world. 5). Most of these will be adverse. 6). Some countries will be much harder hit than others.\n\nMost of the book is devoted to providing an incredibly detailed description of what these consequences of de-globalization are likely to be. As logical and filled with detailed statistical information as these are, I am inclined to believe that there is a great deal of validity to those analyses.\n\nProbably the biggest point on which I am not convinced is that of how likely is the de-globalization to actually occur in the first place. It seems like a lot hinges on the premise that security for maritime trade is an expensive proposition and if the United States abandons its role of enforcing peace on the seas through its navy then maritime trade becomes largely uneconomic and shuts down. This ushers in all sorts of consequences for the world economy. These seem very believable to me, provided that the predicted shutdown of maritime trade does actually occur.\n\nWould it really cost that much for trading nations to spend some of their tax money for maritime security, to replace the role of the US navy? And to establish regional security agreements that allow them to cost-share those expenses between the stakeholder nations?\n\nOne of the frustrating things about Zeihan's work is it seems like he is about the only game in town when it comes to geopolitics. I see video presentations of his work all over youtube. There has got to be someone out there with counterarguments. At the very least there must be some ignorant counterarguments out there, if not some valid ones. I mean, in something like politics you can find beliefs all over the map.\n\nBack to the topic at hand. Another thing I wonder about is the demographics. Zeihan seems to be very focused on the demographic transitions, i.e. relative demographics, and not on the absolute numbers of populations. I am still a believer that overpopulation is a genuine concern. And I have also been of the opinion that the demographic transitions going from a growing population to a stable one (which even Julian Simon acknowledged would have to happen at some point, although he believed the world could handle a population in the trillions), would lead to transition issues (e.g. too many retirees, too few workers), but that was just a fact of life.\n\nSo anyway, on that issue, it would be interesting if Zeihan would discuss his views on the absolute numbers regarding population, what used to be expressed in terms of \"carrying capacity\" of the environment.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that it is reasonable for there to be much less concern about overpopulation today, considering the dramatic decrease in birthrates in recent decades. What I am not convinced of is that the consequences of the demographic transition will necessarily be as dire as Zeihan believes. For example I have long believed that a shrinking workforce may turn out to be a blessing for an economy in which automation is eliminating a large number of jobs.\n\nAnother observation about Zeihan's predictions is that he focuses on what I would call the \"medium term future\". (a few decades) Longer term the fossil fuel economy will end, like it or not, as fossil fuels run out. But it's reasonable not to get much into the longer-term future, because I'm not sure there's much that can be said. About all I can say about it is I wish there were more basic research going on in alternative energy and materials sources to replace fossil fuels.\n\nOne idea which isn't particularly relevant to the book but which I have seen Zeihan discuss: The Ukraine issue. If I am interpreting his position correctly, Zeihan believes Russia has the desire to occupy portions of a number of European countries to so that it will have a more militarily defensible border. The other school of thought (Mearschiemer (sp?)) is that Russia has specific historical and security issues regarding Ukraine, and thus Putin's territorial agenda solely involves Ukraine, and probably just portions of it. Mearscheimer asserts that it's possible that Russia may have the larger agenda, but that there is no actual evidence for that belief. So it would be helpful to know what specific evidence there is for the belief that Putin has the more expansive territorial goals.\n\nBack to the book: Overall, Zeihan's book is staggeringly impressive in the wealth of facts he assembles into his picture of the world in coming decades. I hope he inspires more people to pursue the study of geopolitics so that we can get some other perspectives. Until then, Zeihan is da man.",
    "A review of The End of the World is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan. This book is not just another doomsday prophecy but rather a careful mapping of the collapse of globalization. The doomsday scenario forecast by Thomas Malthus in his 1798 book An Essay on the Principle of Population, in which he predicted that improved nutrition and healthcare would cause a population explosion and result in widespread famine. He was wrong because the result of these improvements resulted in smaller families and a dramatically improved standard of living at the same time the industrial revolution was moving families from farms for which children were an important source of labor to small crowded flats in large cities where children were a rather costly inconvenience. In their 1968 book The Population Bomb, Stanford University Professor Paul Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich predicted worldwide famine in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation, as well as other major societal upheavals, and advocated immediate action to limit population growth. Their dire prophecy did not come to pass either, because as Ehrlich later admitted; he underestimated the effects of the Green Revolution. The problem with the predictions by Malthus and Ehrlich was that they were essentially one-dimensional. Zeihan’s study is multi-dimensional and, rather than an end of the world prophecy, is an account of a process that passed the point of no return in 1980. The world that will end is not the world most of us grew up in, but rather today’s globalized world. The end of globalization and total collapse of the complex digital electronics supply chain will be due to demographic collapse rather than the demographic explosions predicted by Malthus and Ehrlich. The birthrate among cohabiting couples fell to 1.1 to 1.3 in the EU as China implemented and enforced their one child policy. It takes a birth rate of 2.3 children per couple to sustain a population demographic. Zeidan presents evidence that the demographic collapse has already begun in the EU but that it will actually strike full force first in China. Within a couple of years China will no longer have enough skilled labor to fulfill their manufactured goods orders from all over the world. In fact they are already using Uyghur slave labor. So, China will crash first, and then the EU. What about the U.S. and Japan? Japan also has an aging demographic but they have carefully outsourced their manufacturing economy to the countries in which their good are sold so they will continue to import profits from those enterprises which still have viable local markets. The US birth rate did not fall below 1.9 per couple so we are not is as bad a shape as the EU or China as our skilled Boomer generation retires, but we will really be saved by immigration of young people from Mexico. Most emigrants take two or three generations to learn a new language and assimilate but Mexicans have shown they can do it in one generation. Germany will not be able to so easily assimilate largely illiterate emigrants from Africa and the Middle East to become skilled labor in the most complex manufacturing economy on Earth. We have to realize that while Canada, the U.S., and Mexico are three different political units, NAFTA is a single economic unit. Everything we make will be made from raw materials we already have and will mostly be sold within NAFTA without complex supply chains or containerized sea transportation in or out. This is a 500 page closely reasoned book and I have just given the basic argument here. There will be worldwide ramifications in what we call the developing world which will, for the most part, return to pre-globalization pursuits as they are reduced in population not so much by famine but rather by demographic collapse in the developed world due to refusal to be fruitful and multiply.",
    "An entertaining read, suffused with Peter Zeihan’s black humour – and humour is something we’re going to need bags of if we are to stay sane in the dystopian world the writer portends.\nThere are two main angles to the writer’s argument. First, the end of the world order due to the United States stepping down from their role as global policeman. This will leave shipping at the mercy of pirates and nefarious states, which will break down all important trade routes and end 70 plus years of globalisation. Second, ageing populations in the developed and newly industrialised worlds will put economies into free fall as consumer spending and tax revenues dry up and pension payments consume the bare bones of what is left.\nBoth discussions are interesting but full of holes. The writer makes no mention of NATO or America’s continued military presence across the world, including in the western Pacific. I was also baffled by the writer’s insistence that Japan’s navy would protect trade routes in the Pacific. A Google search will tell you that China has not only the largest navy in the region, but on the planet. Use that information as you will.\nAs for ageing populations, Japan seems to be doing okay despite it being a model of where many countries are headed. Mr Zeihan also fails to mention immigration, which has helped increase the birth rates in the US and could do the same for ageing societies such as Germany and countries in Eastern Europe.\nReading this book, you are left with the impression that the USA is a land of milk and honey that is about to get even sweeter. East Asia and most of the developing world are staring down an abyss of famine and de-industrialisation. It does come across as a PR exercise for the US, Mr Zeihan’s home. Much as I like the place, in my eyes it is a country riven by political differences, and which seems prepared to tear itself apart.\nRead this book for the entertainment value but for a more accurate – and positive - vision of the future, look elsewhere.",
    "This book provides a lot of detail on the risks that our current globalized system faces - and how it will all fall down like a Jenga tower if the American brick is moved. Its worrying stuff but I think Zeihan is doing a great job of helping ordinary folk understand the situation more clearly.\n\nIt is a highly readable step forwards from Zeihans previous books. The first 3 Zeihan books - \"The Accidental Super-Power\", \"The Absent Super-Power\" and \"Disunited Nations\" significantly overlap. I read them all but by the end felt as though it was just on repeat. This book concentrates more on the likely outcomes of collapse, working accross all significant areas of human existence as made possible by global economics; energy, resources, finance, manufacturing and agriculture. It adds significantly to overall theme that Zeihan likes to explore and of all his books I think it is the best one.\n\nThis book does not cover so much the reasons why a collapse is likely. So I would recommend to read just 2 of his books \"The Absent Super-Power\" and this one to get the full picture.\n\nHe is an engaging author and the often irreverant interjections had me laughing out loud. Above all this book has really got me thinking about things in a big way.\n\nAnother review dismissed one of his books as the mutterings of a racist taxi driver. He does sometimes come accross that way, yet the book is very well researched and convincing in its arguments, despite getting some of the details wrong. For example, he says that the British political left was all but captured by fascists under Jeremy Corbyn - the reality is that there was a succesfull smear campaign to paint Corbyn as a racist by a media that supported the other party and was prepared to do their dirty work. When you read things like that you do wonder how much of the subtleties of things he misses elsewhere coming from a USA centric viewpoint. Despite that, the overall arguments he makes are pretty convincing and I feel certain that many of his predictions are likely to come true.\n\nZeihan goes against much of contemporary thinking that sees the innevitable rise of China. He is very down on China and with well thought out reasons. Current China worries are hugely over-done, and I think we should be ready to be sympathetic towards the Chinese because their suffering is likely to be immense.",
    "I could not put this book down. Peter Zeihan has weaves together a brilliant book exposing the fragility of our fossil-fuel based globalised world that just does not work without America doing its thing. Depressing, fascinating and engaging. If he is anywhere near right then our world is about to literally come crashing down.",
    "The book itself offers some interesting insights and data; the author has a propensity (which might be cultural) to use hyperbole, whether warranted or not. Personally I find the authors writing style irritating, to be kind. I don't understand his need to intersperse his sentences with \"...like...\" \"uhhm\" \"totally\" plus the odd expletive. Not sure what he tries to accomplish; most likely he is targeting a millenial or Gen Z audience. However, bearing in mind that his own prediction of demographic collapse states that this is a narrow cohort he probably misses the target. In all likelhood Gen X'ers are the main readers for this book and -whilst this is obviously subjective - they would prefer a less lavatorial writing style. It's an interesting topic, but the author wastes a lot of momentum on completely unnecessary and inappropriate personal messaging. Shame.",
    "It's said that the Vatican has a letter from Britain dated AD410 asking Rome to send help (a legion or two) a problem with Saxon raiders. Rome had kept a sort of peace and allowed trade through out the empire. By AD400 this was starting to end the rich romans had lost interest and were not keen on paying their taxes. Western Europe fell into a dark age. Fast forward to now change Rome to Washington and the legions to US ocean fleets. Their my even be a e-mail on some hard drive in Washington from Britain about post Brexit blues. Life will go on of course but has Zeihan says some countries will have to have a rethink, a new dark age who knows."

    "It's hard to imagine a time when kids had a genuine classical education. When learning was centered around being virtuous and wise. When learning emphasized thinking for yourself. But that's the way it was 100 years ago, and it has obviously eroded thanks to progressives. I always had a hard time understanding how Marxists took over our education system--until I read this book. Pete takes us right to the beginning of when this started and just how things got worse over the years.\n\nI found myself longing for the education that might have been. Pete said he went to Harvard and Princeton and was never assigned readings of the great classics. And I long for the Socratic method--where students are challenged to make sure they understand what they are saying/thinking (critical thinking/logic). Since we don't have this today, we witness such nonsense as people shouting, \"MAGA is a threat to our democracy!\" In the past, they wouldn't get away with this. People would ask, \"How?\" No one asks today, so people just repeat the mantra with no shame about not understanding what they are saying.\n\nI was encouraged to read that hundreds of schools now have a traditional classical education, but there are thousands more to go. Pete provides a great battle plan on how to achieve this--an \"insurgency\" as he calls it.\n\nThis is an excellent and inspiring book and one which everyone should read, even if you don't have kids in school, because saving our country requires saving our schools.",
    "There were a few facts that I wasn't aware of specifically the time line of how the Marxists took over the education system. Since I belong to the last fully educated generation I don't feel like I was turned into a Marxist but rather the schools in the South had not allowed that to take over yet and I got the education that put men on the moon and won more Nobel Prize's than all the other countries in the world combined. I hold the history of America and how it was perverted like it is now. That's why the Left wants to kill us off or enslave us so we won't teach the young how America is supposed to be. It's been said that it took the Communists a hundred years to destroy America's education and it would take another hundred years to reconstruct it. For far to long American's have been \"to nice\" as far as treating others fairly. It's time we got mean and brutal with righteous indignation against those who have taken advantage of our \"niceness\". Even Jesus was mean towards those who took advantage of others and ran all the money changers out of the Temple, with a whip no less. If Christians strive towards being more like Jesus, then it's past time to pick up the whip and run the Marxists out of the Capitol building. It's the Democrats and their Republican followers. But they are so deeply entrenched now that you'd have to clean house and start over from scratch. Everyone would have to be imprisoned for life at the Super Max to make sure they didn't undermine you from the outside, and they already have sophisticated organizations set up on the outside in order to run things from the outside if they had to. The Left have covered themselves very well. To take the country back from them would take getting hold of someone who knows enough about the complexity of how things are tied together and walk you through the whole system and destroy it as you go to tear the whole monster down. It would have to be done with the same complexity as the Left put it together in order to make sure you clean all the rats out. And like President Trump said, \"drain the swamp\", and it certainly is a swamp! The NTE would have to be abolished and the Left would sound the alarm and then there would be a war against that juggernaut that would make WWII look like a Sunday school picnic.",
    "This book is spot on. For fifty years I have been saying that the public education system is a black hole, full of administrators making three times more than is reasonable and abusing tax payers money. At the same time the public education system (PES) treat parents like the enemy while at the same time begging for paper towels, tissues, hand sanitizer, etc. Teachers are told to teach for the test. Debate is discouraged. Disciplined has been abandoned unless the teacher gets mad because her class has been disrupted or something was directed at him/her. Teaching or even allowing critical thinking is considered treasonous. I get 1 to 10 page reports from people with master degrees and doctorate degrees that read like they are written by a sixth grader. Even with spell check multiple misspelled words, very poor grammer,, disorganized and lots of words that say nothing. Actually these reports would be an insult to most sixth graders from 40 years ago. This book takes one through the process of how this happened, the negative results of a century of children being used as lab rats by \"educators\", and how the trust of parents was abused. This book doesn't leave one feeling hopeless and helpless, in that it offers potential solutions. Great book, easy to read and understand and without question much needed by the general public.",
    "This is a book anyone concerned with the state of American Education should read.\nMy parents and grandmother were all teachers and professors. Education was always important and valued in our family.\n\nI'd wondered for a while why education seemed to be devolving so drastically. I thought I had an idea, but Pete's book filled in some pretty horrible gaps. I couldn't stop reading it and it made everything very clear. I also realized how much my family had supplemented my education with books and discussions.\n\nEvery parent who cares about their child's education, their lives, even their souls, needs to read this thoughtful and sobering book. The author's passion is on every page. Parents, aunts, uncles, educators, concerned citizens -- buy this book, read it, educate yourself, and finally, save our children's education.\n\nThis is a book that will literally open your mind and change your life -- and your family's -- for the better.",

Central to this crime is the deliberate suppression of the science of formal logic. (Formal logic, invented by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., is the science of evaluating arguments in order to determine if they are correctly reasoned. ) I will fully explain.\n\nYou see, the masses haven't been taught formal logic by State controlled public schools or media for many generations. (In his book ' The Underground History of American Education' John Taylor Gatto informs his readers that this deliberate dumbing down of the population through State controlled schools was adopted nationwide just after the completion of the U.S. Civil War.) Don't believe me? Just go out and ask some average U.S. adults how to determine if a deductive argument is both valid and sound; or the difference between a formal and an informal logical fallacy. (Both are very basic and essential knowledge of formal logic.) You'll find that not one in twenty have any idea. This is not an accident.\n\nThe terrible and murderous lies of our governments rely upon the masses being misinformed, ignorant, and intellectually crippled. And our State controlled schools and media have done this job very well, I'm sorry to say.\n\n\"Ignorance is strength.\"-George Orwell, 1984\n\nThe list of criminal conspiracies, committed by the oligarchs who control our governments, are difficult for most people to psychologically accept. They include the subversion of free systems of government, fraud, illegal war, and genocide on an almost unimaginable scale. Here are a few for which the available evidence is simply overwhelming:\n\n(1) Arab terrorists did not carry out the attacks of September 11, 2001.\n(2) Man never walked on the moon.\n(3) HIV does not, and never did cause AIDS, and our governments have always been aware of this fact.\n(4) JFK was not murdered by a lone assassin.\n(5) The Gulf of Tonkin Incident, which justified U.S. entry into the Vietnam War was a hoax.\n(6) The homicidal cyanide gas chambers of the holocaust are a fraud, devised by the Allies to dehumanize the German enemy, and generate support for the people and state of Israel. The Germans never murdered anyone with cyanide gas.\n\nThere are many, many more bloody lies, as you will see, if only you will accept George Orwell' s invitation to finally become conscious.\n\n\"If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within... But the proles, if only somehow they could become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And yet--!\"\n-George Orwell, 1984\n-------------------------------------------------------\nHere are few quote/definitions regarding formal logic that I hope you will find useful.\n\n\"Ignorance is preferable to error; and he is less remote from truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.\"\n-Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"We ought in fairness to fight our case with no help beyond the bare facts: nothing, therefore, should matter except the proof of those facts.\"\n-Aristotle, Rhetoric\n\n\"The truth or falsity of a statement depends on facts, not on any power on the part of the statement itself of admitting contrary qualities\".\n-Aristotle, Categories\n\n\"We suppose ourselves to posses unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and further, that the fact could not be other than it is\"\n-Aristotle, Posterior Analytics\n\n\"The province of Logic must be restricted to that portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences from truths previously known; whether those antecedent data be general propositions, or particular observations and perceptions. Logic is not the science of Belief, but the science of Proof, or Evidence. In so far as belief professes to be founded on proof, the office of Logic is to supply a test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well grounded.\"\n-John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic (1843)\n\n\"Fallacious reasoning is just the opposite of what can be called cogent reasoning. We reason cogently when we reason (1) validly; (2) from premises well supported by evidence; and (3) using all relevant evidence we know of. The purpose of avoiding fallacious reasoning is, of course, to increase our chances of reasoning cogently.\"\n-Howard Kahane, Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric, 1976, second edition\n\n\"The fallacy of suppressed evidence is committed when an arguer ignores evidence that would tend to undermine the premises of an otherwise good argument, causing it to be unsound or uncogent. Suppressed evidence is a fallacy of presumption and is closely related to begging the question. As such, it's occurrence does not affect the relationship between premises and conclusion but rather the alleged truth of premises. The fallacy consists in passing off what are at best half-truths as if they were whole truths, thus making what is actually a defective argument appear to be good. The fallacy is especially common among arguers who have a vested interest in the situation ttho which the argument pertains.\"\n-Patrick Hurley, A Concise Introduction to Logic (1985)\n\n\"Aristotle devides all conclusions into logical and dialectical, in the manner described, and then into eristical. (3) Eristic is the method by which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premises, the material from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to be true. Finally (4) sophistic is the method in which the form of the conclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three last properly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.\"\n-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy\n\n\"The hypothesis most likely to prove right must do the following: 1. Include all known facts; 2. Not over-emphasize any part of the evidence at the expense of the rest; 3. Observe the laws of probability as established by previous investigation; 4. Avoid logical contradictions; 5. Stay as simple as possible without ignoring any part of the evidence. Hypotheses which violate any one of these requirements are Forced Hypotheses.\"\n-James Johnson, Logic and Rhetoric (1968)\n\n\"This is the argumentum ad verecundiam. It consists in making an appeal to authority rather than reason, and in using such an authority as may suit the degree of knowledge possessed by your opponent.\nEvery man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment, says Seneca; and it is therefore an easy matter if you have an authority on your side which your opponent respects. The more limited his capacity and knowledge, the greater is the number of authorities who weigh with him. But if his capacity and knowledge are of a high order, there are very few; indeed, hardly any at all. He may, perhaps, admit the authority of professional men versed in science or an art or a handicraft of which he knows little or nothing; but even so he will regard it with suspicion. Contrarily, ordinary folk have a deep respect for professional men of every kind. They are unaware that a man who makes a profession of a thing loves it not for the thing itself, but for the money he makes by it; or that it is rare for a man who teaches to know his subject thoroughly; for if he studies it as he ought, he has in most cases no time left in which to teach it...\nThere is no opinion, however absurd, which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can be brought to the conviction that it is generally adopted. Example effects their thought just as it affects their action. They are like sheep following the bell-wether just as he leads them. They will sooner die than think. It is very curious that the universality of an opinion should have so much weight with people, as their own experience might tell them that it's acceptance is an entirely thoughtless and merely imitative process. But it tells them nothing of the kind, because they possess no self-knowledge whatever...\nWhen we come to look into the matter, so-called universal opinion is the opinion of two or three persons; and we should be persuaded of this if we could see the way in which it really arises.\nWe should find that it is two or three persons who, in the first instance, accepted it, or advanced and maintained it; and of whom people were so good as to believe that they had thoroughly tested it. Then a few other persons, persuaded beforehand that the first were men of the requisite capacity, also accepted the opinion. These, again, were trusted by many others, whose laziness suggested to them that it was better to believe at once, than to go through the troublesome task of testing the matter for themselves. Thus the number of these lazy and credulous adherents grew from day to day; for the opinion had no sooner obtained a fair measure of support than its further supporters attributed this to the fact that the opinion could only have obtained it by the cogency of its arguments. The remainder were then compelled to grant what was universally granted, so as not to pass for unruly persons who resisted opinions which everyone accepted, or pert fellows who thought themselves cleverer than any one else.\nWhen opinion reaches this stage, adhesion becomes a duty; and henceforward the few who are capable of forming a judgment hold their peace. Those who venture to speak are such as are entirely incapable of forming any opinion or any judgment of their own, being merely the echo of others' opinions; and, nevertheless, they defend them with all the greater zeal and intolerance. For what they hate in people who think differently is not so much the different opinions which they profess, as the presumption of wanting to form their own judgment; a presumption of which they themselves are never guilty, as they are very well aware. In short, there are very few who can think, but every man wants to have an opinion; and what remains but to take it ready-made from others, instead of forming opinions for himself?\nSince this is what happens, where is the value of the opinion even of a hundred millions? It is no more established than an historical fact reported by a hundred chroniclers who can be proved to have plagiarised it from one another; the opinion in the end being traceable to a single individual.\"\n-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy (1831)",
    "I both loved and hated this book equally. It was so relevant to current times. I almost feel as if Mr. Orwell was a prophet. I see the correlation of what he is writing and the world I am living in now. I never read this book when I was younger, during or after school years. It nearly pained me to read it here in 2022. Oddly enough, my first child was born in 1984. She isn’t (yet) living in this horrible prediction, but I truly fear my grandchildren or great grandchildren just might be someday. When my children started school, I could already see the changes in the educational system since my school days. I actually used the words “dumbing down” as what I felt it to be. It continues to happen. As an adult who reads and still enjoys learning new things, I have realized I didn’t really learn much about history and those who made it while in school. I was taught the basics, names, places, dates and such, but there is so much to the story. Good or bad, what happened, happened. That is, until we allow it to be erased and forgotten. This book has 2050 as a target/goal as to when the “new” is fully in effect. I may not be here in 28 more years, but it’s possible that I could be. The thought scares me. What is coming? I don’t know. But if it’s anything like this ending, I don’t want to be here. If this does play out as written, the future powers that will be, are really just waiting for all us older generations with intact memories to die out.",
    "Not a happy or fun read, but still a must because so few people want to realize man’s inhumanity to man is capable of getting worse. The video screens that surveil every moment of life, including “private” life, in 1984 is already here - and then some. See the surveillance state in China for the epitome of using connectivity, facial recognition tech, AI, social engineering, special police, etc to control billions of people. Reality in some places has made Orwell’s 1984 look quaint. 1984 was definitely a-la-Soviet Union; what Orwell could write now if he were still alive, and based on current technology, would be even more terrifying than 1984 - which was terrifying and depressing enough. Don’t let that discourage you though, this is a truly important book; so you can learn and keep watch and try to avoid this future, or some version of it, at all costs.",

    "Any society implementing Marxism usually ends up like a third-world country with a small wealthy elite, a large administration class and the remainder - the vast majority - living equally in poverty. 1984's Oceania is this dystopian superstate. Winston Smith, the central character, is someone who dares to question the totalitarian regime he is living subject to.\nWhen George Orwell wrote this book, the means of monitoring and controlling people were not well advanced, and many 'anti-state' behaviours could go unnoticed and unchecked. Also, Marxism (and Globalism) had not got a toehold in the West. Essentially then his novel was little more than a work of fiction. Reality is now beginning to catch up. The two main ingredients are now here: Marxism is going mainstream in the West, and technology is allowing governments and organisations to record the minutiae of everyone's life (online comments, credit-card purchases), disseminate propaganda (fake news) and enforce conformity (China's Social Credit System).\nIn this so-called clown world in which we now live democracy is being sidelined, history is being rewritten, truths and facts are becoming 'constructs', scapegoats are being created to funnel hate, the traditional family unit is being attacked, etc, etc. George Orwell would not have to dig deep for inspiration, were he writing 1984 now.\nThis is a very depressing novel; and if you are quite content to live happily in your bubble, then I advise you not to read it.",
    "Review refers to the version published by Prabhat Prakashan and is about printing not the book itself.\nI have only read a few pages but am too irritated by the rubbish punctuation and spelling mistakes which abound. 12 errors in page 1 - mainly \"The\" being written with a capital T wherever it appears. \"Forty-fve\" and \"The lif\" appear on page 1 and \"Win\" and \"ston\" appear twice as if this end of line hyphenation is acceptable.\nDon't waste money on this version. The so called publisher doesn't even have the wit to use spell check!\nFalse economy to try to save a few pounds as now I need to buy a version from a recognised publisher.\nThis one gets no stars from me."

    "If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. It's a must read for any new parent...or maybe also for parents who are looking to do things differently this time around.\n\nA friend of mine highly recommended it for sleep training purposes, but I didn't think much about it. This, in spite of the fact that I once put her infant child to bed for her well before I had a baby, and her baby knew the bedtime routine better than I did. Somehow, the baby coached ME through it. ;) At any rate, my baby had settled into a decent schedule with somewhat set intervals, and he was sleeping pretty good stretches at night. However, I wanted to get on more of a schedule so that I knew how to plan things for us throughout the day. I ended up picking up the book and reading it as we returned from a road trip. We started sleep training the next day at about 14.5 weeks. The first night was rough for all involved, but we dropped our beloved swaddle, night/early AM bottle, and put him into his crib in his room for the first time - all at the same time. Night 2 was much better, and we were basically set at night after that. We did have trouble with him waking up too early for a while (5:30-6am - book calls for 7:30pm - 7:00am sleep), but that stopped after maybe a month or so. And we'd usually let him cry it out unless it was really close to time to get up (6:30/6:45). Now, he doesn't wake up crying anymore, even if he does get up before 7. He rolls around and plays in his crib for 15-20 minutes before he starts letting us know it is time to get him. Enough time for me to pretend to get \"5 more minutes\" of sleep and to run to the restroom before the morning begins.\n\n3.5 months later, sleep training with the help of this book is one of the best parenting decisions I've ever made. We did it before the \"4 month sleep regression\" and did not notice any issues with his sleep in that time period. We did have to go in early in the AM (5ish) when he started rolling, couldn't get back to his back, and would scream as a result, but thankfully that only lasted about 2-3 nights.\n\nAs much as I'd love for him to be on a schedule like clockwork, I'm honestly not that great at staying on schedule myself. However, the routines established courtesy of this book have really helped to make sleep possible no matter where we are (at home on the East coast, traveling on the East coast, in Chicago, or even Hawaii). Even if we can't get a bath in, or if we have to give him a bottle out at dinner instead of at home right before bed, once we wipe him down and/or put on his PJs and hit the white noise machine (Hatch Baby Rest at home or a portable one for travel), he knows the deal. We laugh because even if he is totally wired, he'll often start rubbing his eyes as soon as we turn the white noise on. We go back and forth on putting him down when drowsy or waiting until he's fully asleep, but even if we wait, it never takes more than 10-15 min max for him to go to sleep. I'll accept that some of this may be because he's just a good baby...and he likes to sleep like I do...but I also give MOC full credit.\n\nI won't lie, when people talk about their 6, 9, 12, *24* month old children who still don't sleep through the night, I quietly thank MOC. If they ask me how my baby is sleeping, I tell them....and then recommend the book. I also recommend it to all new moms. I even got the toddler one for a friend who was trying to get her baby in her own room and to drop the night bottle at 1.5 years old. She found that book helpful for that and also for the potty training portion.\n\nThis 0-6 month book was also helpful when it came to introducing solid food around 4 months, and it was reassuring to read the section on falls after he flipped off the couch once. ;) I also got a better technique for clipping his nails (while he is awake). The book basically has all the practical advice that a new parent needs.\n\nThe book is a quick read and doesn't necessarily have to be read chronologically. If you just want to do the sleep training, you can just read that part and maybe a section or to before/related to that. Same for introducing solids. I'd read Babywise while pregnant, and though I guess I got some nuggets out of it, I don't remember much that was particularly actionable. Someone also recommended the \"Healthy Sleep Habits\" book to me when my son was about a week old. I ordered it....like I really had time to read...and I let out an audible chuckle when it arrived and I saw how THICK it was (like 600 pages). I managed to read bits and pieces, but it is super scientific and research heavy. It also lacked the \"do this and then this\" that I really wanted. MOC tells you exactly what to do and when to get the results you want, and that is much appreciated. I also felt that the advice pretty much lined up with the \"Healthy Sleep Habits\" book, just without referencing (endless) studies. I tell people that if they only have the time/desire to read ONE parenting book...make it this one.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll just say this: JUST GET THIS BOOK!!\n\nKindle edition is best so you can reference it (schedule, food lists, etc.) on your phone wherever you are.",
    "This book shouldn’t be taken as gospel. Find some inspiration for what works for you and leave out the stuff that doesn’t. The book clearly says if something doesn’t work/jive with you and your parenting style then leave it out.\n\nFor example, the book suggests leaving your baby in their crib to sleep as soon as possible if your room and theirs are on the same floor. Ours aren’t but even if they were, that’s gonna be a no for me dog. I want my daughter in our room, next to one of us for the recommended at least 6 months. Does that make this entire book useless?? Absolutely not.\n\nIt’s a hard no for me on “crying it out” as well and I’ll be leaving any mention of that out of my parenting style but this book has helped us get sleep with our 4 week old daughter. If you’re a FTP then how to structure your day with a newborn to optimize possible sleep is likely something you don’t have experience with. Using this book, in conjunction with other resources and research, learning about “wake windows” and the best way to feed your baby in the middle of the night has been a huge help for us.\n\nWhen we first brought our daughter home, my husband and I dreaded nighttime. There was a desperation and anxiety around the sun going down. I’d be awake all night counting hours until the sun came up because it was better than night. Implementing a bath time routine and “tender time” before bedtime feeding has made this time of day my favorite. It’s not just better, it’s my FAVORITE time with our daughter and that can’t be overstated.\n\nDon’t take every word as gospel but this book can be useful. Give yourself and your baby grace, they’re new, so are you and a tight schedule with a baby isn’t possible. But you can take some control back in your life and help optimize your babies sleep.",
    "I know this book and the methodologies are not for everyone but it’s a great resource for new moms. Helped us get on a great schedule and our baby sleep through the night at 8 weeks!",
    "If you do what this book says, your baby still sleep though the night. Buy it. Read it. A lifesaver!",
    "Since day one of using the moms on call schedule, my 4 month old baby has been sleeping through the night!!! The first 2 nights she cried on and off for about 15 minutes then she went to sleep. And now she knows when it’s nap time and bedtime and is ready to go to sleep! She also is happier throughout the day with this new schedule and she is now getting proper sleep and rest. Best Book Ever!",
    "This book provides great tips for moms! My favorite part is the daily schedules they give for each stage. Very easy to read.",
    "I was losing hope of ever being able to get more than two hours straight of sleep. My husband and I were both exhausted and frustrated being first time parents to our 5 week old. We felt aimless and and didn’t know how to add structure back into our lives. I asked another mom friend how she got her boys sleeping longer stretches and she immediately pointed me to moms on call. I had never heard of it but now I will be telling everyone I know about it! Within 3 nights my 5 week old only woke up once from 9pm to 5:30 am. She is actually sleeping for naps now instead of fighting them, it’s truly crazy how fast things have turned in the right direction. Cannot recommend their schedule enough.\n\nMy only critique would be that they are really strict with some things, but for the most part you can just take what you like and leave what you don’t :)",
    "Came from USA so had to wait a bit, but so worth it. Heard this book being mentioned in all sleep training videos on YouTube from parents. Honestly, just confirmed that everything I’ve been doing with my 2month old setting a routine etc has been correct to build the best sleep habits. My 2 month old is sleeping trough the night, 9.30pm till 5am first feed - not bad ! Also nice included sleeping plans to follow, as well as sections of insights on commons sicknesses and how to treat , general info on how to swaddle and feed.\nAnd so on and so on, just so so helpful for first time parents , something to get reference from when needed.\nOh, but my book came and it was printed upside down, anyway that’s not a deal breaker for me.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this to any first time parent. To use intensely or loosely, we found it really reassuring and easy to follow.",
    "Not reasonable price",
    "Recommended on netmums. Followed the 4-6 month sleep routine without solids, worked amazingly well for my twins who had previously been bf to sleep since birth and would not be put down awake.",
    "Worth buying! Tips are very effective and sleep training has never been easier. Dont know how I could have managed early motherhood nights without this book!!!"

    "This is a must-read for anyone trying to understand our current state of affairs in the United States. It is well researched and thoughtful and brings us front and center in the corrupt world of \"Big Law\" and its relationship with corporations and crooked politicians. This is storytelling at its best. I got the hard copy and loved it so much that I got the kindle version.",
    "Although I have experience in large law firms, I learned so much in reading this book. Jones Day is a highly reputable firm with many highly ethical professionals. However, the indictments waged in this book applies to the legal industry writ large. One aspect that hit me is the abuse of each client being represented in court. In fact, the best lawyers are found in the legacy law firms who richly reward them for representing the largest corporations. The disparity is obvious.",
    "A must read. Couldn’t put it down.",
    "Want to know how Abbott Labs can sell families poison baby formula and feel no meaningful repercussions? How Purdue Pharma profited from the opioid epidemic? How the courts were permitted to allow evictions during Covid lockdowns? And more generally, how a broad swath of American public policy has been handed over to non-elected Catholic extremists., who have killed the right to abortion, kneecapped the EPA, eroded the barrier between church and state with a particular aim at handing schools over the church? The answer, in large part, is the law firm Jones Day.\n\nThis book is well-researched, stretching back to the firm's quaint, midwestern, 19th century roots. It's implicitly judgmental; Enrich never tells us what to think, but almost any reader is going to come to the conclusion that this firm has played the system to the benefit of themselves and a narrow band of ideological allies, with a cruelty that borders on evil. There is no benefit to being right in the world of Jones Day, only to winning. I found myself mapping glee onto the faces of their lawyers as they attack their clients' victims. For what it's worth, the book also suggests that the firm's blessing of Donald Trump was essential to his presidential run in 2016. Maybe that was known to others but it was new to me.\n\nThis is the third of David Enrich's books that I have read. In his first, he explored how traders at big banks around the world stole money from their clients but escaped punishment, in part by collectively blaming a single autistic trader in Singapore. In his second, he explored the history of Deutschebank, their Nazi past, their abetting of drug dealing and money laundering and Donald Trump. And yet this one, about a white shoe law firm that never breaks the law, seems the most sordid.\n\nSo many people have suffered, and the lawyers at Jones Day seem so smug. I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that for every exploitation by Jones Day there ought to be an equal and opposite one from a progressively minded firm that keeps the system in check. Or maybe not, because lawyers work for money and money tends to be conservative. Regardless, the system has shifted, thanks in part to the hard work of Jones Day, far beyond the interest of the public. We'll see what happens in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nGreat work by Enrich, a fascinating look at how sausage is (cynically) made in board rooms, and in Washington, and in courtrooms across America.",
    "High praise for David Enrich and his latest exposure of how things work when corruption becomes the norm and the norm becomes a network of practices, and excuses under the \"rule of lawyers\" gone power crazy. One wonders what it would look like if other truths behind the law-doors were revealed, and certainly the public could use one to explain what really happened in the Mueller probe behind the 'Curtains.' It is a bit of lucky circumstance that Servants of the Damned: Giant Law Firms, Donald Trump, and the Corruption of Justice Among other big names (and there are several that should be scrutinized) comes out to the public simultaneously with Geoffrey Berman's 'Holding the Line' (revealing the manipulations behind scuttling the Southern District of New York by Barr under Trump). One wonders if the later case against Trump was dropped subsequently from other internal pressures or manipulation, or for that matter if we will ever know one way or the other. The history of the insidious growth of UN-elected institutional power under the Federalist Society and its influence upon the courts is a growing menace. A revolving door between appointments and large firms should become a serial investigation historically and into current affairs. From non-profit think tanks set up by these same awyers to bypass democratic selection and influence government, to unethical behavior blatantly repeated by established power groupings, the idea that only lobbying is having excessive influence over the nation is seriously understated. Big money and Law firms are two sides of the same coin. The fact that 'Gibson Dunn' has been accused, for example, of unethical litigation tactics is easily found on-line. On line public resources also record that in one situation the Supreme Court itself called Gibson Dunn's abuse of the judicial system a practice that amounted to legal thuggery; while their use of a 'kill stop' preemptive intimidation 'playbook' has been the target of an article in 2018 highly critical of the tactic. Of course the bottom line is whether things are legal or not. If they are not against the law, they are optionally operational and presumably acceptable practice. That is the amoral default line being 'held' and the ethical broken bar of the legal systemic as dictated at the top of legal paradigms. These are supposed to be the \"elites\" and the smartest lawyers in the country. We are told over again that we are a \"nation of laws\" -- all the time, but the truth seems to be more that we are a political system of lawyers that rarely break rank to expose the actual practice variances in this so called \"rule of law.\" A \"rule of Law that has plasticity in structure and elasticity that is molded to form fit the highest bidders and political powers. Obstruction of Justice, obfuscation; delay and dismiss is explained away as \"too complex to investigate\" and after all, would take too long to pursue through the courts. This frustrating realty seems to be in the news daily but we the people were indoctrinated with a blind trust that, in America, justice delayed is justice denied. Just a phrase; a rhetorical dismissal of scrutiny for the elites, and quick harsh punishement for everyone else. It seems to be, in reality, a double edged sword that ends up to being the tactical/technical 'get out of jail free' card for the institutionally connected, the wealthy, and the politically powerful. Preserving images, career survival under market politics, and saving face has become the true measure of the game and whether we have an Institutional democracy or a constitutional democracy seems more rhetorical than historically authentic. Having said all the quiet part out loud; thank Heavens for Enrich; exposing the facts behind the gaming of the system and not just holding the line in self preservation.",
    "This is the essence of great reporting. Revealing the tangled web between the law firm Jones Day and their impact on our judicial system, (and the corruption that ensued), David Enrich gives us a glimpse behind the curtain about how the benches where Justice is meted out, became nothing more than another form of currency.\n\nMcGann, part of Jones Day who later went on to serve Trump, used his connections to dismantle and damage our Republic. Working with The Federalist society, they put together a list of lawyers to put on the bench that would do their old firm’s bidding reshaping the Federal Judiciary.\n\nEnrich details the history of Jones Day-who represented unsavory clients on a consistent basis including Purdue Pharma and, eventually, Donald Trump. They used their influence to shape the judicial benches of the United States through Trump working inside the White House."

    "This unusual tale, first told many years ago, is more true for today than it was then. Everyone should read it, and especially have your children read it when they are old enough to understand it, and maybe you should help them to understand.

I highly recommend 'Animal Farm' whether it be leisure reading, curiosity or political reflection.",
    "I’ll admit that I had not read this book since assigned to me in school. Many decades ago. Its premise had always stuck with me though.

Bad things are happening - all the signs are here, but we dismiss them so we can continue feeling safe.\n\nIf 1984 describes our near future, Animal Farm is the here and now.\n\nOrwell clearly wrote this knowing what had happened before, to warn us it would almost certainly happen again.

Text is a nice size and there is great additional content. Well worth a buy! No spoilers here, just buy it and read it, you really won't be disappointed.",
    "[Spoiler warning]\n\nGeorge Orwell was very good at writing books which would continue to be relevant for the future. It is often said that he accurately predicted the future with 1984 and Animal Farm but sadly he wasn't predicting the future he was writing about what was already happening at that point in time. Situations such as:\n* Manipulating the lower class animals to work harder and longer to achieve a greater good whilst at the same time reducing their food rations and living conditions. Simultaneously the ruling class of pigs got richer and increased their luxuries. ]\n* The use of propaganda to stir emotion in the animals and get them to conform.\n* Convincing the animals that certain facts they had previously been told had never happened.\n* Demonising someone and blaming them for all the bad things that were happening at the farm.\n\nI'm sure anyone reading this would be able to draw parallels to worldwide modern life and political systems and those of years gone by.\n\nThis is an important book for any young adult to read, perhaps for them it would be an eye-opening, powerful story but sadly for most adults we are more likely to adopt the role of Benjamin the Donkey, we've seen it all before.",
    "This is only a short novel, stretching to just over one hundred pages, written in simple English, but with a very powerful message. It is easy to read.\n\nAlthough set in rural England it is a thinly veiled critique of Stalinism written at the time when the dictator was at the height of his power and in integral ally in the fight against Hitler. A little understanding of European history during the 1920's and 1930's is necessary to make the parallel connections, but the plot still works without this knowledge. This is a story about how the less fortunate can become victims of the manipulative. It is about the abuse of power and how the unscrupulous could brutally exploit the willing. Unlike the sub-title it does not have a fairy-tale ending.\n\nThe introduction and the two appendices [compelling essays in their own right] give a nice insight to why the author wanted to write this story and the original Establishment objections to its publication."

    "I recently finished Meditations by MA and decided this would be a good book to stay consistent in my new found journey of stoicism. I have to say I was more than impressed by this book. It was exactly what I wanted it to be and more. It gives dates and lessons to put into practice. Weather or not do follow them day by day is up to you. You could always just read a random page of the book whenever you need inspiration. I strongly believe anyone interested in the pursuit of a stoic life should invest in this. It’s a gold mine of wisdom.",
    "The philosophical school of Stoicism may have been born in the 3rd century BC, but it has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years. In modern times, Stoicism served as the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy, a psychotherapeutic technique used to treat depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, and other mental maladies. Many contemporary would-be Stoics, however, prefer to bypass CBT entirely and go straight to the source for their life-coaching by using the writings of the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome as the basis for a guide to living. With all the Stoic self-help books published in recent years, it was only a matter of time before one utilized the “daily affirmations” format. Such is the strategy of The Daily Stoic, published in 2016. The book was written by Ryan Holiday, a former PR man and marketing director, and Stephen Hanselman, a publisher and literary agent with a master’s degree in philosophy.\n\nAs the title of the book indicates, The Daily Stoic delivers 366 mini-lessons in Stoicism, dated January 1st through December 31st. These daily entries are divided into months, each revolving around a different theme, such as “Passions and Emotions,” “Duty,” “Fortitude and Resilience,” and “Virtue and Kindness.” Each daily lesson begins with a quotation from an ancient Stoic—most commonly Epictetus, Seneca, or Marcus Aurelius, but the authors also include selections from less familiar Stoics like Musonius Rufus, Cleanthes, and Zeno (the latter quoted from Diogenes Laertius’s Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers). Holiday and Hanselman then provide a page or two of elaboration on the quote and how it applies to the problems of modern life.\n\nOverall these daily Stoic meditations are really quite well-written. The authors are adept at taking ancient Stoic concepts and translating them into plain English without dumbing-down the philosophical content. Holiday and Hanselman certainly know their stuff and write about Stoicism knowledgably and intelligently. They often use examples from history or current events to illustrate the points made in the ancient quotes, which keeps the text interesting and relevant to 21st century readers. If you have already looked into Stoicism, chances are you’ve probably already read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius or the Discourses of Epictetus, but this book will help you see those texts in a new way. Occasionally, the lectures sometimes veer into what one might call “self-help shaming,” implying that if you’re not living your life to the fullest, then your life is a waste. Such instances read more like a 21st-century conceit than what the Stoics had in mind when they promised a life of tranquility. Overall, however, I found the book quite insightful and useful.\n\nThough I believe in Stoicism and its benefits for mental and emotional health, I did not diligently stick to the lesson-a-day schedule the book prescribes. Sometimes I got bored with The Daily Stoic and let several days go by without picking it up; sometimes I would enthusiastically devour half a month’s worth of entries in one sitting. This is not the best book I’ve read on Stoicism (William B. Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life is hard to beat), but it is better than most. If you are serious about Stoicism, these daily contemplations on Stoic thought can be a useful tool to augment your studies. Having just finished the book with the end of the calendar year, I’ll probably just go back to the beginning and read it all over again.",
    "Author have done an exemplary and difficult task of Stoicism theory understanding with practical application. You will benefit. Give yourself the gift of using these profound and clear practices.",
    "I started reading the first day. My brother recommended this book to me. I have enjoyed and have learned something everyday I read it.",
    "Stoicism is not a religion. In religion the sacred texts lay out the ideal way of life and guide us to try our best to live a sinless (perfect) life. Stoicism sees the world completely the opposite, it acknowledges the harsh realities of life, the chaotic mess of the world that is filled with imperfections. And instead of demanding us to live up to a certain perfect standard, it gives us the tools to handle the real broken situations on the ground.\n\nFounded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in 3rd century BC, this branch of Greek philosophy got big in the Roman Empire, with its principle philosophers of Epictetus, Seneca, and ultimately Marcus Aurelius with his most-quoted memoir “Meditations.” The author of this book, Ryan Holiday, reads and re-reads Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations for 100+ times, which was the main reason why I choose this book as the 1st book I read on Stoicism.\n\nAt its core Stoicism gives us clarity on what we can and can’t control. It teaches us that although we can’t control what happen to us, we can control our perceptions about it. It teaches us that even though we can’t control how we feel, we can control how we react to it. It teaches us that all emotions are generated from within ourselves, and what comes out from us can be controlled by us.\n\nAs Ryan Holiday sums it up “[t]he three most essential parts of Stoic philosophy worth carrying with you every day, into every decision: Control your perceptions. Direct your actions properly. Willingly accept what’s outside your control.” Indeed, focus on the things that we can control, as Holiday elaborate “[i]f we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.”\n\nAnd suddenly the things that matter and the things that are insignificant become abundantly obvious. If we spend less/no time on the things that don’t matter and won’t make any difference, we will have more time for the things that we do have an influence over. Getting emotional over an injustice, for example, is being human. But unless we direct our grievances to something that fix or expose the injustice, getting overly emotional about it with no action won’t do any good. Another example is when we get ill. Don’t moan about the illness, but focus on how to cure it: figure out what the illness is, what’s the cure, and focus on the curing process. Dwelling on how ill you are won’t accomplish anything.\n\nThis simple but powerful philosophy is what kept Nelson Mandela sane during his 27 years in prison, as he reads and re-reads Marcus Aurelius’ book “Meditations” in Robben Island. Bill Clinton also read “Meditations” once a year, while Thomas Jefferson had a copy of Epictetus’ book “Discourses” on his bedside. Furthermore, Stoicism is also highly popular among Silicon Valley people and dilligently used to set the mental state of numerous pro athletes. And reading Seneca’s “Letters From a Stoic” was what prevented Tim Ferriss from killing himself during his darkest period of time, and turned his life around into becoming a successful author and investor, among others.\n\nIndeed, Stoicism is not a religion, but if it were its 3 main gospels are Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditation”, Epictetus’ “Discourses” and Seneca’s “Letters from a Stoic.”\n\nAnd being the ultimate compilation of Stoic wisdom, if Stoicism is a religion this book would be its book of hadiths, the book that compile the sayings of the prophet(s). It spreads over 366 mini chapters that comprise a year, which makes it easy to digest and can be learned one day at a time. In fact, this is the first time that I re-read a book straight after I finish reading it cover-to-cover, which I digest the 2nd cycle of reading according to the date of the year, one chapter each morning as a part of a new daily routine.\n\nI could not recommend Stoicism enough, and this book is a perfect introduction to it.",
    "Excellent Alternative Thought to Help Enrich the Mindset on the Journey to Loving and Living One's Best Life!! Recommended by a Dear Friend; Highly Recommend to You!",
    "Incredible book. Provides awesome quotes + breakdowns. Almost 3 years using it everyday. It’s awesome like everything else Ryan Holiday touches.",
    "The Daily Stoic isa great book, very easy to understand, no complicated jargon using huge words that noone understands. It's down to earth and anyone looking to take the complications out of their lives to live a worry free or if you're just looking to take steps to simplify your life more then I highly recommend.",
    "In theory the Daily Stoic Meditations and Daily Stoic Journal are a fantastic idea.\nThough they are in English they are firmly aimed at a US audience. They are full of references to Lincoln, Washington and other individuals from the short history of the United States. This is jarring and an annoyance. With a wealth of history to choose from it's a shame that the author was unable to find better common reference points for English speakers.",
    "I’ve had this book for a while now, this is the second copy. Last year I was given an advanced stage 4 cancer diagnosis in November, completely out of the blue after thinking I had a hernia. Not what I was expecting mid 40’s. After the initial shock I picked up the daily stoic again which happened to be acceptance (November) and death (December). Funny how the book seems to know what you need lol!\nI have to say the daily musings on both, particularly death completely altered the way I was coping (catastophising) and as a result I saw the diagnosis for what it was, got my head in order and accepted whatever was to come along. After almost a year of treatments, including a full gastrectomy, two lots of chemo and radiotherapy I’m still using the book daily and referring back to it whenever I feel the need.\nOk this is probably an extreme case for a review but for £8, the price of a few coffees, it’s been invaluable. Whatever is round the corner for me in the future who knows but it’s pointless worrying now about it. Buy it if you want some real world perspective on life and your role in it, you won’t be disappointed.",
    "I am a new comer to the Stoics but from study so far I have found much to admire about their philosophy.\nThe 366 meditations offer a page a day of stoic wisdom. No complaints so far it's all been good stuff, some has made me think again and been helpful. I think I am going to like stoicism.\nThe Stoics had the view that life can be very difficult!\nStoicism has just a few central teachings. It sets out to remind us of how unpredictable the world can be. How brief our moment of life is. How to be steadfast, and strong, and in control of yourself. And finally, that the source of our dissatisfaction lies in our impulsive dependency on our reflexive senses rather than logic.\nStoicism doesn’t concern itself with complicated theories about the world, but with helping us overcome destructive emotions and act on what can be acted upon. It’s built for action, not endless debate.\nStoics take time each day to look inwards and reflect on our shortcomings and review how the day went and see if there is anything we could have done better. Doing this daily helps us to refine our habits towards what we really want to do with our lives, pushes us to do more and see obstacles as something to be overcome.\nI havent made a huge study of the stoics yet but what I have discovered has been good and is helping me to give life direction and feel a sense of purpose. I already feel more in control and satisfied because of it.",
    "I discovered Stoicism through reading Tom Wolfe's 'A Man in Full'. That's a really good read so I won't go into detail because of spoilers.\nThis book is more self-help than all the other self-help books put together. It's not 'preachy' just practical. The format is a ideal. Each day of the year has a quote from a famous Stoic and brief comment on the quote. It doesn't tell you 'do this and that will happen'. It asks you to ask questions of yourself. Two or three minutes reading in the morning and a whole day of thinking. You will get out of this what you put into it. If you're new to Stoicism the views may surprise you. If you're an old hand Stoic it's a great way to start the day.\nThis book could change your life. To what degree is up to you.",
    "Sometimes with the pace, pressures and constant distractions of daily modern life, you need to be sat down and reminded of some common sense.\n\nIn this book grandads Seneca, Epictetus and grumpy uncle Marcus will give it to you straight. In their day it really was tough.\n\nI read this book everyday and it has been a springboard into further philosophical research, something I’d never have previously considered.\nI recommend this book to everyone, it benefited an angry, frustrated misery like me enormously. Imagine what it could do for you."

    "The science presented in this book along with a wholeistic view of sex for women was the best book I've read about sex. I wish I had read it early on in my 20's and plan on giving it to my daughter during middle school so she'll start to understand her body - and developing a \"sex worth having\" mentality instead of the pornographic style of relating that's permiating our culture.\n\nThis book was EXCEPTIONAL!",
    "This book is geared towards women, but I honestly feel EVERYONE could learn something from this book! My husband read it and he has even recommended it to other people. I also bought this for all of my daughters! It’s a great book! Get it! Learn and grow from it!",
    "Book is a great read for all ages and genders!",
    "My girlfriend recommended this book and my goodness was it a GAME CHANGER. Men out there this book kills the \"woman are difficult\" myth. I sent like 4 copy's to woman I knew in my life this book is on my top 5 of my entire life! There is a TLDR part if you need a crash course and reading isn't your jam. Lastly the audio book is amazing there is extra comedy there 👍",
    "This book should be standard reading for all adults. It revolutionizes how people think about genitals and sex (in a good way). If you’re considering buying this, just buy it right now. It’s a must-read. You’ll be better off for having read it. It’s appropriate for men to read too; my husband was appreciated the info in the book too.",
    "I would give this a 4.5/5 stars if I could. It is a very good book, regardless of what reproductive parts you have, regardless of what your sexual orientation is. It can be a great book for those healing from a traumatic past. The main reason it lost 0.5 stars for me is the fact that (1) it gets slightly repetitive; (2) it feels a little preachy at times and; (3) I really wished it touched on the feelings of dissociation that comes with sex for some individuals. I understand it's impossible to cover every potential sexual health problem under the sun when it comes to engaging in activities (be it with a partner or otherwise), but dissociation during an activity can be EXTREMELY common. She maybe barely touches on it for a paragraph in this nearly 300 page book.",
    "Read this with my therapist book club. Already finding it useful with clients.",
    "Very helpful to help us get out of our heads and just let energy flow for optimal pleasure the entire time.",
    "This book took me on quite a journey. I read it because I felt broken, I felt like what I was experiencing was my fault. That I should want sex more.\n\nBy the end of the book I learned so much more than what I was expecting and decided to write a letter to my husband explaining the secret ingredient - me, knowing, understanding and respecting me. We then talked about our accelerators and brakes and responsive and spontaneous desire. I explained how the media, cultural and medical messages have trained my brain to respond in some very specific ways to things he has said.\n\nWe discussed the things I had learned about myself and he simply said... Well that all makes sense and smiled. This book has given me the tools to communicate with my husband in a way I never thought I'd have the confidence to do.\n\nThank you, whenever I hear someone talking about feeling broken or struggling with thier sexuality or relationships I will recommend this book.",
    "Like many others I bought this off the back of the sex education reference by Maeve. I have to say it was boring, repetitive and overall disappointing.\n\nI wonder if the author paid for the reference or is in the know with the show writers?\n\nThe fictional book by Dr Jean Milburn in sex education is a book I'd love to read!",
    "A phenomenal book that is relevant to SO much more beyond only sex.\nDeserves to be in schools - for women AND men.",
    "I have really enjoyed reading this book. It felt broader than sex advice. More like advice for life generally. Excellent!",
    "Every women and I would say every man in the world would benefit from this book.\nAs a psychologist I wanted to give this book to each one of my clients.\nBrilliant job."

    "Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer gives a wildly new perspective on plant life and their relationship to humans. Wall Kimmerer takes us through experiences and knowledge she has gained in her life through her connection to both science and Indigenous Wisdom. Wall Kimmerer discusses the near annihilation of Indigenous people’s traditions, ideas, and languages. Not to mention their removal from their lands and their cultural assimilation into the new European-American culture. This was forced upon Indigenous people and there are still lasting effects to this day that they strive to counteract. Language is only carried on through elders that wish to pass on the language and culture to the youth. Robin Wall Kimmerer is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and had felt disconnected from her Native American roots because of the strong American identity that had been forced upon Native Americans when Europeans arrived. By dedicating much of her time to the study of plants and the connections she can find to Indigenous Wisdom she has been able to combine both perspectives as objectively as she can.\nShe stresses the importance of the relationship between humans and the natural world. She claims that Mother Earth is showing love to us with the gift of her plants and animals and that we must show our love back and treat her with respect. For example, you must ask plants permission before you utilize them, must give an offering (in many cases some tobacco sprinkled on the ground), and must show gratitude to the Earth and the plants that replenish us. On the other hand, Wall Kimmerer discusses the negative and surprisingly positive externalities that are observed due to humans and inflicted on the Earth. As you might have guessed pollution is a big negative effect along with overhunting and the disturbance of ecosystems. However, Wall Kimmerer discovers that harvesting sweetgrass in the way that she was taught through Indigenous people is actually beneficial for the sweetgrass. Without being harvested the sweetgrass starts to die because of overcrowding and other factors. However, the harvested sweetgrass plots were flourishing. This of course relates to the title of the book which draws on the idea that Sweetgrass was one of the four sacred plants to the Potawatomi people.\nWall Kimmerer does an excellent job portraying the importance of having a mutual relationship between nature and humans. Prior to reading this book I had no idea that there was this vital relationship between us. Wall Kimmerer utilizes the relationship between her and her daughters to help readers understand that Earth shows love to us just as a mother does to her children. I thought that this was a brilliant comparison between two seemingly unrelated topics. It was a great way to explain that the plants that are provided for us on Earth aid us in living our daily lives to the fullest and it seems that we ignore her gift and repay her with pollution and overusing her gifts. Just as children sometimes forget the importance of their mothers and how grateful they should be for the numerous things they do for them everyday.\nAnother concept that Wall Kimmerer presents beautifully that adds to the book as a whole is the relationship between corn, beans, and squash as described from stories she’d heard from other Native people. They were regarded as the Three Sisters. Kimmerer compares this to the structure of human families when she says “The firstborn girl knows that she is clearly in charge; tall and direct, upright and efficient, she creates the template for everyone else to follow. That’s the corn sister...This bean girl [middle sister] learns to be flexible, adaptable, to find a way around the dominant structure to get the light that she needs. The sweet baby sister is free to choose a different path, as expectations have already been fulfilled. Well grounded, she has nothing to prove and finds her own way, a way that contributes to the good of the whole” (p.132). The plants grow in the same way as the sisters progress in life. In their own ways to come together as a collective whole. This connection truly struck me because it reminded me of my own family and my two younger siblings. Surprisingly, her description matched my family pretty well. This is a terrific way to get the reader to truly humanize the plants in a sense. As a species we tend to place things that are not as advanced as us (by our own standards if I might add) in a category below us. Yet this comparison truly allows us to look at these plants as equals with social structures just as ours. They simply communicate through methods other than speech.\nOverall, this was a lovely book that picks up on the relationship between the human world and the natural world and really made me rethink a lot about picking random flowers on the street without asking them if I can first. She utilizes her life experience perfectly in order to recount her journey to a more respectful way of treating the environment around her. This book will make you rethink your actions towards the environment and get you thinking deeper about what we can do to keep plant knowledge alive.",
    "Robin's gift of telling the story invites those who listen to experience our world from a totally different perspective, where all of life is a gift given to us, where we are the youngest brother and sisters among our elder siblings from whom we can learn what is needed. I've never read a book that allowed to walk in another person's shoes so totally, seeing life with new eyes and rejoicing at what I was seeing and return what was being asked from me. Seeing life as a \"gift\" is so radically different that the worldview we grew up with and live out of today. And we can see the results of that worldview all around us. Bur she does not ask us to chose one or the other, but right in her title \"braiding sweetgrass\", she asks us to weave them together: what she is sharing through her People's Indigenous Wisdom, what we're given in our\npresent world through scientific knowledge and what grows all around, what plants have to teach us. Weave them tightly together to have a better sense of what is being asked of and ways of doing what is needed to curtail our destruction of Mother Earth and begin to work with Her in ways that bring healing, not only for her but also for ourselves. A beautiful, poignant example of what she is asking us to take up the strands and do.",
    "This book masterfully blends science, spirit and the senses in a way that leaves you thinking, processing and feeling deeply. Each chapter reads like its own personal essay, and I found I enjoyed reading one or two and then letting it sink in for a few days before reading the next. It made my heart ache with homesickness for rural Upstate New York where I grew up, and got me thinking about how I can work with native plants and practice reciprocity here in my Southern California home. Robin Wall Kimmerer has a gift for storyweaving, and I am so grateful this book crossed my path.",
    "After reading this book, I will never eat a meal or walk outside or engage in any activity without being aware of nature's lavish gifts and my responsibility to honor the earth in all that I do. I promise to give back in whatever way I can. \"Braiding Sweetgrass\" should be required reading for high school students as well as adults interested in continuing life on this planet!",
    "If I had anything negative to say, it's that I was not ready for how impactful this book was.\n\nA fresh reminder that as we learn more of the world we are fortunate enough to inhabit, as our influence over our surroundings grows, so to does our responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of our world. In this way, we not only honor ourselves, the earth, and our ancestors, but ensure the health of the world we give our children.\n\nA book meant to be read and shared, a message to be spread.\nDon't skip it.",
    "This book is amazing. I bought this book thinking it was about plants and indigenous knowledge, but it is so much more than that. Each chapter has so much to draw from it, I find myself going back to intentionally read lines again and again, getting something new each time. I can’t wait to reread this book.",
    "Braiding Sweetgrass reads like a meditation, and so well written one can almost eat it with a spoon. It marries science and traditional indigenous wisdom. It is a peace offering to our souls and a thank you to earth itself. Do yourself a favor: purchase this book. I give it as gifts it's that good.",
    "This book is lyrical. It is a road map to saving the Earth - and ourselves included. We are long overdue for a new theory of political economy, one that not only doesn't destroy the very bed we sleep in but renews it - and us with it. We know that too much noise and too much \"stuff\" has left us compartmentalized and deeply unhappy. I eagerly await the release of the young adult version to share with the youngsters my life touches.",
    "This is a truly exceptional book. It is a letter of love, respect and gratitude to our Mother Earth. It is a prescription for how to restore our world and take the right path and turn back from the brink of our own destruction. The author puts her message across with gentleness and grace; this by no means lessens its impact.\n\nWall Kimmerer draws on her own life experiences and her half North American Indian and half white settler ancestry. Her writing blends her academic botantical scientific learning with that of the North American indigenous way of life, knowledge and wisdom, with a capital W. She brings us fair and square to our modus operandi of live for today who cares about tomorrow, our throwaway society and our greed that can never be sated. It is clear that by comparison with our indigenous brotherhood we are absolutely the younger brother; the loafing teenager with no respect for anything their elders have to tell them, but rather thinking they know everything and they know best.\n\nThe author, rightly in my opinion, says that all of the messages that we receive, practically on a daily basis, about the destruction that we have so far wrought to our home planet do not in fact spur us into action, but rather send those that care into a frozen state of despair. Her idea is rather to take relative baby steps to try to restore landscapes local to us. She gives an example of a wrecked landscape local to her that people are gradually trying to rescue and bring back to life with some success. It is also about developing a creed of gratitude and reciprocal relationship to our environment, only taking what is needed and never more. Wall Kimmerer gives plenty of examples of how this can be done.\n\nShe is never sanctimonious and is the first to acknowledge that it is far easier to write about the correct way to live than to actually live it.\n\nFor all who care about our planet and nature and for all who wish to learn about the balanced life that the North American Indians lived before the white settlers destroyed their culture and way of being, I would highly recommend this book to you.",
    "I am a female forest firefighter in Northern Ontario Canada and this book came with me all fire season this year as my pleasure reading while out in the bush, and is now fully battered and loved and has ashy fingerprints ground into every page. I've always been a biology nerd and adore living and working in the bush , but this book managed to open my eyes and I felt like I was seeing everything in technicolor for the first time this year. The way I concieve of myself in relation to the natural world, as well as the philosophy from which I now interact with my environment on a daily basis has been completely revolutionized by this book. The very way that I walk through the woods is now different. Written with a fierce and honest beauty, Kimmerer's elegantly balanced prose is somehow ornate yet minimalistic all at once,. Her intersecting identities as indigenous, woman, mother, poet, and acclaimed biologist are all woven together in a beautiful tapestry in this work, which is itself a truly wondrous and sacred offering to creation. Her weaving together of traditional indigenous knowledge corroborated by today's biology has made the science of plants and ecosystems come alive for me in a way I've never experienced. It is now my favourite book of all time and I will read it again and again as long as I live and work in the forest. I encourage this book for literally anyone who even remotely 'enjoys the outdoors' or 'cares about the environment', especially those who live in North America and probably do not know nearly enough about the cosmology of the original peoples of this land. This land has rules, rules that indigenous people know and learned and honour and abide by, and we are all (uninvited and very violent settler colonizer) guests in this land and we have never bothered to learn the rules and customs and natural order of this place. She provides an excellent way forward for settlers who want to learn more and try to honour our precious environment and the land here and live right, without just co-opting or appropriating from native culture to try and do so. It's a complicated dilemma, how we can try to belong here in a place that our ancestors stole and colonized. But she handles that delicate dance with both grace and firm conviction. I wish this was required reading in highschools across the continent. I know I will be buying multiple copies over the years to give away!",
    "I love this book. My all time favourite. A book full of information about ecology and botanical science, written in a beautiful, readable style. A rare combination of science, with native wisdom and knowledge.\n\nIf I was marooned on a desert island, this would be the book I'd take. It's taught me that even if there were no other humans or animals about, I'd never need feel alone, if trees and plants were present. A great reminder that we humans have no more important a place, than any other species on this beautiful planet. I am so grateful and glad I read it.",
    "Stunningly poetic. Informative, intriguing, inspiring. A book that took me by the hand and led me from despair to hope. A fabulous new way of looking at life and our place in the world. A marriage of science and creativity that faces problems and offers solutions. Braiding Sweetgrass has made a huge impact on the way I experience and live my life.",
    "This women is simply extraordinary. She writes with kindness and elegance, she writes with her heart and her soul. I have learned so much from her words and wisdom, it opened my eyes, made me realize; I want to be a part of the ecological solution;. Which is why after finishing my Indigenous Studies, I have been accepted in Environmental Sciences. This book changed my life."

    "It’s a present",
    "In 1981 when 19 year old Jarvis entered San Quentin State Prison in California some of my views were naive and myopic. I erroneously believed that the foster care systems in California and our country were effectively operational and beneficial to all. Not too many years later, I learned the sad truth.\n\nThere are many ways to think about THAT BIRD HAS MY WINGS, Jarvis Masters' second book. First, don't expect to read about an angry, bitter and resentful man. Instead, the author talks to us without self-pity and blame - he takes responsibility for his actions. Jarvis takes his readers with him on a courageous journey of self-discovery.\n\nI must agree that this book is a \"testament to the human spirit\". It is most definitely an inspirational account of one person's resiliency and determination. The author was not afforded the luxury of a computer or even a pen or pencil. He was required to use only the fillers from ballpoint pens. Can you imagine how many pen fillers he used and how physically uncomfortable this must have been for him? Because of Jarvis' perserverance, we are confronted with the disturbing realization of what happens to many children who are removed from their homes. How can your heart not hurt when you hear the innocent words of young Jarvis morph into that of a troubled adolescent and young adult - a person who craved only love and acceptance, first from his family and then from his peers? I cried when Jarvis was removed from his first foster home, the first place where he received unconditional love, respect and positive regard. Throughout the book I wondered what his path might have looked like if he stayed with this family. For me, Jarvis' honest account of his experiences was often difficult and frustrating to read. The foster care system that was designed to protect him did just the opposite. It failed him and continues to fail others like him in so many obvious ways. The exposes and documentaries continue to tell us what's wrong with the foster care system. When will there be the right mix of money and people to effect positive change for our youth?\n\nWho is the audience for this well-written book? I believe THAT BIRD HAS MY WINGS should be required reading for those who are in positions to orchestrate positive change. This includes politicians, policy makers and administrators. I strongly encourage high school teachers to include this book in their curriculum. I also recommend this book for anyone who has an opportunity to influence a child's life and future. All of us can better the life of at least one child. Sometimes this responsibility cannot be left solely to parents or other relatives, teachers, health care professionals, coaches, etc. What could happen if many more of us volunteered a small amount of our time to tutor or mentor a child, or to be a Big Brother or Big Sister?\n\nThanks to his spiritual practice, and supportive and loving people, Jarvis Jay Masters successfully turned his life around. He seems at peace. I can imagine a day when he is out in the community, directly working to improve the future of our impressionable youth. When that day comes, he will be far, far away from his current residence at San Quentin.",
    "This book has brought me so much wisdom, connection and joy. Jarvis’ past and his mindful reflection upon it has been healing for me.\n\nI could see so clearly how futile the current correctional system is in the us, how it keeps punishing those the most that need help the most. And how at age 19 Jarvis was no more than a boy thrown left and right by his past trauma, abusive upbringing which turned into his implicit body memories that made him live out the worst over and over again to end up in a prison just like his earliest childhood home must have felt. It’s all laid out so clearly and evidently leading to the outcome it took without really being able to blame anyone, neither him, his abusive mother and family, nor the white oppressors that set up the system in the first place.\n\nIf we could all see clearly as Jarvis did that at the heart we just want to matter, to be connected and live in peace, we can change many things. I hope Jarvis can walk as a free man soon and I’m inspired to do what i can to contribute to less harm and more freedom in the world and hope to get a chance to meet Jarvis one day!",
    "This book is not an easy read in terms of subject matter. But it is worth it if you want to expand your opinions about our youth and how to keep them from being institutionalized from a young age.\n\nThis is a man who acknowledges his mistakes and takes responsibility for them, and who is using his time to help others as best as he is able. He admits the crimes which landed him in San Quentin prison, and speaks about them frankly and without self-pity. He talks about the challenges he has faced in conquering himself; his anger and his self-destructive tendencies.\n\nHe is on death row for a murder he had nothing to do with, and for which there is, apparently, DNA evidence proving his innocence. I can only hope that an appeal will get him off death row.\n\nWe are left with that \"There but for the grace of God go I\" feeling, because by accident of birth, many of us have not had these experiences. I bought twelve copies to give out as Christmas gifts to friends, in the hopes that maybe their consciousness and awareness could be expanded by reading this. I think that anyone who reads this may look at life and our inner cities with a different eye. That Bird Has My Wings: The Autobiography of an Innocent Man on Death Row",

    "Cut to the Chase:\nA well-written synopsis of 11 “great” companies and some of their similar characteristics, this is a fun, quick read that is great in terms of party trivia and information… but it’s tougher to judge if you’re looking for more of a business how-to. Partially, it has aged poorly — many of the companies selected have since had meltdowns of epic proportions (for example: Fannie Mae, Circuit City), and the “how to” part of the book feels generalized and far more subjective than the methodology/selection criteria would have you believe. Still, you’ll learn quite a few fun facts about how some of these business started and/or converted to become the giants they are today.\n\nGreater Detail:\nThe main premise of this book is that though there are many very successful, long-lasting corporations out there (Coca Cola, GE, etc), there are a handful of companies that transcend just long-lasting durability, and become truly “great” companies. The selection criteria (mostly explained in the appendices) identified 11 “great” companies out of 1,435 analyzed, mostly via things like stock performance (the companies chosen were at about market average for about 15 years, and then jumped to being about seven times better than market over a period of 15 years, hence the title: good to great).\n\nThe idea was to then take a more in-depth look at the 11 companies to see what similarities existed, and to then compile kind of a how-to in terms of what distinguishes the greats. Some of the ideas explored are things like:\n\n1. The Level 5 Leader — Collins proposes the idea of a leadership hierarchy of skills; a Level 5 leader is a dual personality of sorts — someone who is basically modest, but willful and stubborn, almost introverted and shy, but simultaneously fearless (this is kind of the opposite of say the CEO-centric view where Apple was in part defined by Steve Jobs as a leader and a personality, Bill Gates by Microsoft, etc). He argues that the Level 5 leader is someone who does what’s in the best interests of the company — no matter what (preparing for crises before they happen, sacrificing part of their lives often, etc). Counter examples given are leaders who so define the role that they’re unable to appoint successors, or have a successful successor — the argument here is about systematic management, filling the role that the company needs, for the good of the company, and almost without personal ego.\n\n2. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop — Even though the media sometimes portrays changes as though they’re instantaneously effective or immediately impactful, in reality, most companies that are successful slowly build momentum via a flywheel effect, constantly confronting the “brutal” truths and having faith that with discipline and continued effort and momentum, a breakthrough will happen. The Doom Loop is when there is a lack of patience that leads to continued cycles of new leaders, new directions, and new innovations, without ever waiting to see something through.\n\n3. The Hedgehog Concept — This is the concept of doing one thing really, really well. Here the argument is that you don’t have to be the best at everything, that Walgreens became a great company by getting rid of its restaurants (it had over 500 at one point) and focusing on what it was strongest in — being a convenient drug store. It focused on location, location, location (always being on a corner, for example), offering 24-hour pharmacies, flu shots, expanding into poorer neighborhoods, and being an almost pervasively convenient option for its customers. It basically asks companies to think about what they can really be best at and specialize a little, find something they are passionate about that they can truly excel at.\n\nAs I’ve said, it’s an interesting read. and in terms of things to make you think, there’s a lot of good cocktail party fodder — is it better to have an invisible leader who sacrifices everything for their company? Or is there benefit to having a targeted leader to focus on (the Zuckerbergs and Jobses, leaders who are synonymous with a company’s image). But if you’re reading it now, more than a decade after its initial publication, it’s hard to take it as seriously when it talks about Fannie Mae (which has gone through a federal takeover/bailout) or Circuit City (which has filed for bankruptcy) or even Wells Fargo, which has had its share of legal and financial troubles. Also, though it’s a nice retroactive, backwards-looking book about what has helped 11 particular companies, it’s hard to know how much is truly applicable going forward. So in that sense, it’s less of a how to go from good to great, and more of an interesting, almost historical read, about how these particular companies made the jump (and then sometimes plummeted back).\n\nComparisons to Other Books:\nI had a similar experience with Collins’s Built to Last, which was supposed to detail the successful habits of “visionary” companies. It was a fun synopsis of a six-year research project by Stanford, and I learned all sorts of interesting trivia, but, as with many books that are backwards-looking studies of still-in-business companies, it’s sometimes hard to take the overarching messages seriously knowing how some of the chosen companies have performed since publication. I think these are great books if you’re looking to read something interesting about the business world, but I’m not sure I’d really call them instructive per se.",
    "Jim Collins states in his book, \"Good is the enemy of great. And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that become great...We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\" After reading that statement I became very curious and wanting to continue reading to see what are the components that make a good company to be a great company, in hopes of maybe being apply it myself one day I really enjoyed the way in which Collins organized the book. From his five year research study of 28 different companies Good to Great discusses key critical concepts revealed through his studies as to why some companies became successful great companies, while the others continued to be good. Collins found from his research within a great company you will have discipline people, with discipline thought, drives discipline actions. Within each discipline it is broken down into a subset of two components:\nI. Discipline People\na. Level 5 Leadership\nb. First Who... Then What\nII. Discipline Thought\na. Confront the Brutal facts\nb. Hedgehog Concepts\nIII. Discipline Action\na. Culture of Discipline\nb. Technology Accelerators\nI believe by organizing the book in this matter enabled me to really understand the severity of the critical components and how their relationships if applied will in allow a good company to become a great company. Starting with Discipline People, Collins conducted and analyzed his research by introducing the types of leaders you would find in a great company versus those in a just a good company and the characteristics that these great leaders possessed, such as humility and will. They lead with the interest of the company and not for their own selfish reasoning. Next was the First Who ...Then what which discuss getting the right people on board and the wrong people out. Collins states, \"People are not your most important assets. The right people are.\" Collins stresses the importance of first getting the right people in the right places in your company and weeding out the wrong and then figure out where your company wants to go.\nNext is the Discipline Thought, within the subset of discipline thought a company must possess the ability to confront the brutal facts and not live in denial. Being able to do this will allow the company to stay updated and proactive when faced with making decisions. Collins presented a methodology for the companies to be able to face the truth. He says an organization must lead with questions not answers, engage in dialogue and debate, and use the \"red flag mechanism\" where anything that is red flagged is information that cannot be ignored and must be handled immediately. Collins also mentioned under the category of discipline thought is the Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is about a Fox and Hedgehog, where the Fox (good companies) knows a lot about variety of things whereas the Hedgehog (great companies) knew a lot about one thing. Being hedgehog is more beneficial for both the company and the individual because it the clarity drives focus and direction whereas the fox has neither one direction nor focus which can backfire later down the road.\nLastly, having discipline people with discipline thoughts will drive to discipline action which uses the culture of discipline and technology as another tool to help transform the company from good to great. Collins also refers to the Flywheel Concept. He says that a good to great company never happens all at once it take a lot of effort and time to get it going, like the flywheel. The flywheel requires a lot of pushing to get it to turn and after x amount of time it will begin to gain momentum.\nThroughout the book Collins gives great examples for each discipline and its component and how it either went from good to great or continued to be good. Along with the examples Collins provides pleather of diagrams and charts in the appendix, which becomes a great reference for the reader and creates a better understanding of what is needed to go from a good company to a great company. Generally the book is a very easy read which makes it that much more interesting to want to apply to your company or even for yourself. It takes the feeling of the impossible away, like Collin stated, \"We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\" Overall if you are looking to transform your company, Good to Great is a read that I highly recommend.",
    "I felt like things did not start to move till around halfway through the 3rd chapter. Before that it seemed to get stuck on the statement, \"will reading this make you great, well we can't promise that...\" several slow parts in this book making it difficult to finish. There were some interesting points such as how the main thing is to have a goal and stick with it and how there was no consistency of specific goals between the \"Great\" companies that matched, such as being kind to others, or \"just in it for the money companies.\" I do agree with having the right people on the bus makes a huge difference. Unfortunately those other people usually stay too long past the (bus stop) time they should be off, and if the bus is full of those individuals you will not have room to hire the right people to help fill the bus. Good luck on your read and possibly get this as an audiobook so you'll finish it faster than I did.",
    "Good to great summarises the findings from extensive research into what makes certain high performing companies outperform their peers. The findings are both interesting and capable of being replicated by any company that wishes to improve performance.\n\nThis book is very concise and full of interesting case studies. It was one of the few occasions when I wished the book could have been a bit longer.\n\nWell researched, well written, well done!\n\nHere are some of the learnings I will be taking away from this book:\n• All Good to great (“GTG”) companies had a Level 5 leader\n• Level 5 leaders consistently exhibit humility, modesty and an ability to reign in their ego.\n• Many companies are drawn towards outgoing egocentric leaders and this is often the wrong choice.\n• Level 5 leaders are more interested in something larger and more lasting than their own career\n• GTG leaders concentrate on hiring the right people before deciding on strategy\n• Don’t compromise when hiring. If you’re not confident then keep looking\n• When someone needs to leave the company act quickly\n• Give your best people the best opportunities and not your biggest problems\n• GTG management teams have rigorous debates and aren’t afraid to share their views. But when a decision is made they act as one\n• GTG companies ensure information flows give management the right facts to manage the business effectively\n• GTG companies foster a culture where employee’s views are heard and acted upon\n• GTG companies review failures without negative consequences for the people involved\n• Figuring out how to motivate people is a waste of time. If you hire the right people they will motivate themselves.\n• Good to great companies did one thing exceptionally well and stuck to it (the hedgehog process)\n• GTG companies developed their strategy from a deep understanding of what they could be world class at. This was not a goal or intention but an understanding of reality\n• GTG companies typically focussed on one KPI e.g. profit per customer\n• GTG companies were incredibly disciplined and did not waste time and money on unrelated activities and acquisitions\n• GTG companies used technology as an accelerator of, not creator of, momentum\n• Careful consideration should be given to whether a given technology fits with your hedgehog concept\n• GTG companies often looked like an overnight success from the outside but in reality they were long in the making and a result of persistent action over a long period of time.\n• Preserve core values and purpose while strategies and practices endlessly adapt with the changing world",

    "Such a disappointment sadly. I had high hopes for this book because it's hyped up and a bestseller (for some reason). Couldnt get beyond the first chapter, flicked through and was met with more of the same. Very academic, more like reading a university research paper than a book (don't be fooled). It terms of practical advice to implement - very little to offer. Every paragraph had dates, statistics and peoples names which personally I find really hard to engage with and not easy to read.

    "I read this book with great interest as it's selection criteria for the finally selected 11 companies was strict and the author does not withold any information on the selection process either. The end of the book lists its selection criteria, complete with a comprehensive FAQ section.\n\nThe final selection consists of 11 good to great companies (Selected from 1435 Fortune 500 companies) and 17 comparison companies that could not qualify. The primary selection process consisted of baselining the 'good to great' companies at three times the market for fifteen years including 15 years of good performance (1.25 time the general stock market) preceding the transition while the company had to be an established, on going company, not a startup.\n\nPretty strict criteria that has led to some eye opening findings. Most of the findings can be browsed by reading the reviews on the Amazon .co.uk and .com sites.\n\nA MUST READ BOOK for all aspiring and current leaders."

    "Reading The Dawn of Everything is an ambitious undertaking, especially for those of us who are not scholars of ancient civilizations. The writing itself is often academic, with scholarly cliches and insider quips. But stick with it!! The overall quality of the work will transform the way you think about history. Instead of reading entire chapters in a single sitting, try tackling small sections within each chapter that are clearly marked by large sub-headers. Often the sub-headers pose questions and are a clever way of prompting the book’s readers to re-imagine human history. Is the narrative that we have been led to believe about human history true or accurate? Yes and No.\n\nWhat we have been taught about history according to the conventional line of thinking contains false narrative. Plenty of credence has been given to the transformation humanity made when it transitioned from being a hunter-gatherer society to becoming an agricultural, food-producing society. This assumption is both right and wrong. In many instances, there is no clear demarcation as to when this transformation took place. Furthermore, there were many ancient societies who adopted agriculture as a fledgling practice, only to later reject it and revert back to the immediacy and efficiency of a hunter-gatherer way of life.\n\nConsider the following: Whole parts or entire centuries of human history have never been recorded. And when human history has been recorded, the task was often done by the victors of war, not the vanquished. Winners and losers notwithstanding, it is time for us to find out what is true and what is not. Here is one bonafide truism: from the beginning of human history, there has always been an ongoing tension between communities who wanted to be self-governing (egalitarian) and those who wanted to rule top-down (authoritarian) by exerting their control over communities in order to amass power, wealth, or perhaps even to court the favors of the gods. Interestingly, these two divergent forms of cultures coexisted concurrently during the same period in time, and in some cases lived not far apart geographically.\n\nFor example, the indigenous people of California had markedly different values than the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest. The California indigenous people—Yurok—had values similar to the early Puritans with a cultural emphasis on stoicism and simplicity, decrying wastefulness or excess. The Northwest indigenous peoples enjoyed loud, large-scale grand celebrations, replete with gluttonous feasting and messianic dancing that went on for days, and were fond of acquiring slaves, a practice that was an anathema to the Yurok. The two societies, who were in contact with one another, defined themselves by their differences in the same way the Greek societies of Athens and Sparta defined their identities by one being the polar opposite of the other.\n\nSchismogenesis is the term coined by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson to define how two very different cultures are able to form a solid identity because of the existence of the other. Think of how the alt-right and GOP define their beliefs that are precisely so unlike what liberals and progressives believe. Consider how the authoritarian state of Russia is driven to conquer and subsume the democratic nation of Ukraine. Here is another bonafide truism: from the beginning of history, the self-governing (egalitarian) and top-down rulers (authoritarian) have been able to successfully manage the dynamic tension between them to live in a guarded but peaceful coexistence. On the other hand, the two cultures have erupted into warfare, destruction, and the immolation of one culture at the expense of another. Aside from having better weapons or more advanced technology, the chief factor in predicting which type of community ultimately flourished—either the self-governing or the top-down—is by examining who left behind the better narrative. Who recorded history? The victors or the vanquished?\n\nThere has always been a commonly held belief among historians and teachers of history that the origins of self-governing societies came about due to the influence of men like Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacque Rousseau, John Locke, (Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l'Aulne conspicuously known as Turgot), Charles Montesquieu, and half a dozen other political philosophers whose brilliant thinking shaped the democracy that we know and enjoy today. Conventional notions about the history of humanity have been derived from western thinkers and are the backbone, or backstory, of what we learn in school; it’s what our high school history teachers taught us to believe.\n\nSo, it might come to a surprise to those of us who were taught by staid history teachers to learn that many indigenous cultures were indeed the first egalitarian cultures who supported individual freedom. It might come as a further surprise to learn that some of the fundamental tenets of our American democracy originated with indigenous peoples and not with the litany of great western thinkers. The western thinkers who wrote a trove of essays and treatises about democracy did not give credit where credit was due—to indigenous peoples, but they did indeed leave behind the better narrative.\n\nTake Charles Montesquieu; there is no question that Montesquieu had a profound influence on the formation of democracy. Montesquieu’s theories were put into practice by founding fathers of the United States when they framed the U.S. Constitution. His theory of creating a system of checks and balances, and the separation of powers among the executive, judicial and legislature branches of government, was intended to ensure a balance of power that would preserve the spirit of individual liberty. What is not commonly known is that Montesquieu’s thinking was profoundly influenced by the Osage, a Native American tribe of the Great Plains. Montesquieu’s learning derived from the Osage gave him the impetus to build an explicit theory of institutional reform in his book “The Spirit of the Laws,” which is widely hailed as a blueprint to create a government that is based on laws, not men—and that is precisely what the early framers of the U.S Constitution created.\n\nIt has been further proposed that Haudenosaunee federal structures (the six nations of the Iroquois) might have also served as a model for the U.S. Constitution. According to the book’s authors, it is interesting that “any suggestion that European thinkers learned anything of moral or social value from indigenous people is met with derision to condemnation.” The Jesuits, who have traditionally been deemed as the arbiters of cogent thinking about democracy, proclaimed the abhorrence of freedom that they witnessed among indigenous peoples, calling it the “wicked liberty of the savages.” In their observation of the Wendat they fail to see how their freedom had anything to do with the Eurasian notion of “equality before the law.”\n\nAlong comes Wendat philosopher statesman Kandiaronk, an elegant, erudite thinker who is as comfortable among his own indigenous people as he is interacting with the European newcomers who have made their way to North America. The Wendat and other indigenous people are astonished in their observation of the earliest European missionaries for their squabbling and backbiting over their possessions and property. These newcomers fail to offer support to one another and their submission to authority amounts to little more than blind obedience. Worse of all, the new settlers used their power over possessions and property as a way to exert control and power over other human beings. It was only a matter of time when Kandiaronk, who is cast with the slur “noble savage,” is eventually heralded by European thinkers as one of the by the great thinkers of the day. In Jean-Jacque Rousseau’s essay “The discourse on the origins of social inequality,” he asks, “How is it that Europeans are able to turn a mere unequal distribution of material goods into the ability to tell others what to do, to employ them as servants…or to feel that it was no concern of theirs if they were left dying in a feverish bundle on the street?”\n\nThe actualization of the self-governing (egalitarian) versus top-down rulers (authoritarian) becomes more than a dynamic tension between two different types of cultures, but it is at the very crux of how power and wealth came to shape the world we live in today. A very small percentage of the world’s population do control the fates of everyone else and are doing so in an increasingly disastrous fashion. A quick recap of some of the most pressing problems in the 21st Century, ranging from climate change, and grossly unfair economic practices governing energy and food production to nuclear proliferation and imperialist acts of aggression that cause great human harm and suffering, all of these issues and more provide a clear bellwether of the predicament that we find ourselves in.\n\nHow did we get here? This is the proposition often asserted by authors David Graeber and David Wengrow. The answer is more complex than viewing humans as either innately self-governing (egalitarian) or innately top-down (authoritarian). The authors address seasonality among ancient communities, that is when the same society alternated, switching back and forth, between self-governing and top-down modalities depending on the time of year—harvest required a stricter division of labor, but the summer might bring about days of creative play. “If human beings, through most of our history, have moved back and forth fluidly between different social arrangements, assembling and dismantling hierarchies on a regular basis, then maybe the real question should be ‘how did we get stuck?’”\n\nMaybe a more precise question arises: Why can’t we move back and forth between self-governing (egalitarian) or innately top-down (authoritarian) based on what our society needs at a given moment? On the other hand, isn’t that what we do in post-modern democracy when we vote for new leadership during an election? The Dawn of Everything inevitably inspires readers to ask these questions. Despite the regularity of modern-day elections and the continuing dynamic tension between self-governing (egalitarian) or top-down (authoritarian) modalities, the pendulum never swings too far toward freedom. Humans have lost the flexibility and freedom to manage their own lives and are stuck being subordinate to the overwhelming domination of possessions and property, where money rules and where money makes the laws and the moral code we are required to abide by.\n\nTo examine why humans get stuck, we take a journey through numerous archeological sites, many of them obscure to those of us who are not scholars of ancient civilizations: Gobekli Tepe (southeastern Turkey), Poverty Point (northeastern Louisiana), Sannai Maruyama (northern Japan), Stonehenge (southern England).We learn it is impossible to know what forms of property or ownership existed. If private property has an origin, a pattern of belief and practice as old as the idea of the sacred or divine, the question remains: how did incessant squabbling and backbiting over possessions and property take hold in so many aspects of human affairs?\n\nGoing back to the dawn of everything takes us to Catalhoyuk, an ancient city in Turkey circa 7400 BC where evidence of successful Matriarchate or mother rule is deemed to be more than a way to run a society but is the foundation for the collective unconscious. Minangkabau, a Muslim people of Sumatra, also describe themselves as matriarchal. Other indigenous peoples, the Wendat, Hopi and Zuni, also qualify as matriarchies. It is no wonder that Kandiaronk, the great democratic thinker, lived among the Wendat. Matriarchal cultures are self-governing (egalitarian), and emphasize social cooperation, civic activism, hospitality and simply caring for others.\n\nArcheologist Marija Gimbutas preferred to define these societies as matric instead of as matriarchy, citing the latter as a mirror image of patriarchy. The political rule of women is further defined as Gynarchy or Gynaecocracy. For example, Minoan Crete, from 1,700 to 1450 BC offers no clear archeological evidence of a monarchy. In its art, artifacts and bones, women are found to weigh in on a larger scale than are men. Most of the available evidence from Minoan Crete suggests it was self-governing (egalitarian), a theocracy governed by a college of priestesses. After exhaustive research of the matric societies in ancient history, archeologist Marija Gimbutas revealed her findings. She was shunned and dismissed by her colleagues—the male academic and scientific community.\n\nHistorically, (the history we learn in school), greater emphasis is placed on Pharaonic Egypt, Han China, Inca Peru, Aztec Mexico, Imperial Rome and Ancient Greece, all rigid rank and file societies held together by top-down (authoritarian) government, where violence was rampant, and the radical subordination of women was the norm. Why top-down authoritarian governments dominate the narrative as being the official rendering of history is, in and of itself, a topic worthy of exploration. Now here is the good news: eventually human history does tell its own story, one that is greater than the narrative spouted by the victors. The real story of human history is told through its art, artifacts and the bones it has left behind.\n\nConventional patriarchal thinking about the dominance of a winner take all, top-down (authoritarian) modality points to our fall from the garden of Eden—the Faustian pact humans made with wheat, the domestication of large seeded grasses, marking the transition from the hunter-gather society to becoming an agricultural food-producing society. This assumption is dim and narrow, especially when there are so many other factors to consider, weighing in on everything from the personalities of would-be kings to understanding how Mesopotamian urbanites were organized into autonomous self-governing units. The story of Gilgamesh and Agga, about the war between Uruk and Kish, describing a city council divided into two chambers, will keep you up at night because it is too reminiscent of the schisms between the right and the left in the U.S. Congress in our post-modern world.\n\nThe Dawn of Everything was never intended to be a good read in the same vein as a pop-nonfiction page-turner. The many ancient civilizations that are explored will force you to read and reread passages to commit names, dates and circumstances to memory, and there are more footnotes than a non-academic can bear! If it’s hard to read, then why bother? The Dawn of Everything is complex and brilliant as much as it is simple and brilliant, and that puts human history into perspective. For example, the invention of the light bulb had huge ramifications for the modern world. Yet many Neolithic discoveries had the cumulative effect of shaping everyday life as profoundly as the lightbulb: bread rising, cultivation of crops and growth cycles, ceramics, mining, all of which are still with us today.\n\nIn the parade of ancient communities that are explored in The Dawn of Everything, we are able to consider the epoch transitions in history: Agriculture, Industrialization, Transportation, Energy, Technology, and how each transition impacted the ongoing dynamic tension between the self-governing (egalitarian) and top-down (authoritarian) modalities. We might find that there are no sure answers, but we can embrace the following truth: Freedom is a constant struggle. We are also left with the burning desire to ask the right question: How did our post-modern world arrive at this point and place time? This is especially important to ask in our current age, which is steeped in Kairos—an opportune moment in history, when real change is not only possible but inevitable. You can’t come to a fork in the road to make a decision, unless you have taken the journey to get there, and reading the Dawn of Everything is that journey.\n\nWe are hereinafter called to ask the right questions about the true origins of history and to use our imagination instead of accepting false narrative by glossing over the parts of human history that were never recorded or intentionally omitted. There is much still to be learned and we don’t know all of the answers. The version of history that is accepted by the governing few can dictate how historians and teachers of history decide what is true. However, at the end of the day, mass graves and archeological sites do distinguish self-governing (egalitarian) societies from those that were top-down (authoritarian). One final truism: If we know where the art, the artifacts and the bodies are buried, the bones do not lie.\n\n#\nNote: I wrote this book review to pay tribute to David Graeber who died to due to Covid-related complications in 2020, before he could see the publication of The Dawn of Everything. What a powerful legacy! I want to extend a sincere thanks to both authors David Graeber and David Wengrow for undertaking this project. I learned to think about history in way that re-imagines the possibilities for all of us and for that I am grateful.",
    "Traditionally, scholars of “human nature” have focused on 2 opposing poles. Rousseau portrayed hunter-gatherers as existing in a state of childlike innocence, intellectually inferior but peaceful and without hierarchy. In this scheme, the agricultural revolution ruined this egalitarian paradise, introducing social class, inequality, and debilitating new forms of labor. In contrast, Hobbes’ authoritarian state stood as a bulwark against anarchic violence, whereby a collective repression of instinct (to domination, hierarchy, and naked self-interest) would allow men to live in security, however limited their freedom of action might be. Whichever you prefer to emphasize, development followed a rigid plan: agriculture meant civilization, hierarchy, and war. Graeber and Wengrow object to these simplifications, not only as blatantly inaccurate historically, but as limiting our imagination to a denuded range of possibility, pointing to capitalism as inevitable and the most efficient way to organize society.\n\nTo remedy this, the authors go back to the archaeological record. The result is a dazzling tour of prehistorical societies, revealing that many of them flatly contradict the frameworks of Rousseau and Hobbes. We can, they argue, reinvent ourselves and the proof of a far richer range of societal organization lies in the archaeological record.\n\nEven though non-Western philosophers were dismissed as irrelevant to the debate, the authors observe, the trenchant critiques by indigenous peoples shocked many Enlightenment thinkers, in particular the Mi’kmaq of French America. They despised the French for their authority-driven society, materialism, lack of freedom and peace, and aggressive struggle for prestige and power – little better than slaves or brutes in their view. The Mi’kmaq suffered none of these things, but arrived at coherent decisions by consensus, were perfectly capable of refusing to follow a chief’s orders, and could up and go to settle in a new place whenever they wished to live under different rules. Indeed, the Mi’kmaq appeared rational, skeptical, and empirical. Many philosophes were awe-struck, indeed the Mi’kmaq appeared enlightened. The contrast to European despotisms was so stark that it may have influenced Montesquieu, Jefferson, and others to formulate republican conceptions of self-government.\n\nWhat we need to do, the authors argue, is to re-open our minds, first by looking at the evidence that is emerging in recent decades and then recognizing how our conceptions of human nature are flawed and tendentious, reflecting our parochial preoccupations, if not frozen in a colonial mindset. Interestingly, they noted, the absence of private property deprived Wendat chiefs of the ability to convert their wealth into power; economic resources were owned by the family or even the entire community, shared as egalitarians. Their women enjoyed both sexual liberty and the power to divorce. In the case of crimes, the individual was not held culpable: that fell on the entire clan or lineage, a clear incentive to keep their kin under control without the need for police or central authority.\n\nThere was, of course, a reaction to this perspective. Turgot, one of the Enlightenment founders of economics, portrayed freedom and equality among “the savages” as a sign of inferiority. Self-sufficiency, in this view, meant that everyone suffered equally. Moreover, he argued, as societies developed more “sophisticated” technologies, inequality became inevitable. Turgot represented an entire theoretical style of social evolution, presenting a single ladder to capitalism and later, colonial domination in accordance with Victorian moralists. This influenced much of the academic work that followed.\n\nWith that, the authors embark on a brilliant and dense review of recently discovered evidence that contradicts longstanding assumptions and narratives that started with Turgot, Rousseau and Hobbes. They include: 1) the Göbekli Tepe, a hunter-gatherer society at the end of the last Ice Age that developed institutions capable of supporting the erection of major public works, i.e. pre-agricultural. This was assumed impossible.\n\n2) It took centuries for agricultural societies to develop because the social transformation required was viewed as too onerous and the dividends too uncertain and too costly an investment. Instead, hybrid hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies emerged, with seasonal festivals to work the land giving way to hunting and gathering in other periods. There was no single pattern for the transition to agriculture, which was viewed by many as a form of enslavement to the grain they cultivated. Some developed grain societies only to definitively reject them, as the Cahokia culture did. As they write: “You can’t simply jump from the beginning of the story to the end, and then just assume you know what happened in the middle.” That is quite a profound insight when you think about it.\n\n3) Distinct ethno-cultures (and later nation-states) did not define themselves after the Ice Age, but evolved over many millennia in fluid and highly cosmopolitan forms. For example, Poverty Point, a Stone Age Settlement and meeting place on the Mississippi, brought huge gatherings from very far afield together for material trade, intellectual exchange, ritual celebration, and shared labor. The same is true of Hopewell in what is now Ohio, leaving visible traces in man-made hillocks and other configurations. These examples are legion and utterly fascinating.\n\n4) For most of human history, private property was not viewed as a sacred or sacrosanct norm. Innumerable cultures did not develop it as an institution, but had it imposed on them during the colonial period. It was not necessarily, as Locke implied, the precursor to human rights and freedom or societies of law, as the Mi’kmaq illustrated. This was also true of the enclosure movement in early modern England, when communal pastures were closed off in favor of aristocratic landowners.\n\n5) Ideas did not necessarily spread because they were in some way optimal or effective. For example, California foragers held property sacred, eschewed indulgence like Puritans, and employed violence to protect their prerogatives and resources; they prided themselves on labor they accomplished themselves. In contrast, the Northwest Coast tribes took delight in excess (in potlatch festivals), hunted slaves to avoid labor, and developed mafia-like courts to control their society. Apparently, the mechanism for these differences was schismogenesis, according to which they observed what the others were doing and chose their own norms as a way to distinguish themselves. In other words, these groups did not act as automata whose behavior was determined by their environment: they chose how to build their societies.\n\n6) Cities did not emerge in consistent patterns: some cultures never developed palaces or temples (signs of “emerging complexity”), but existed in sometimes massive communities that remained egalitarian, even similar to welfare states, such as the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture (roughly in modern-day Ukraine), an urban agglomeration that pre-dated those in Mesopotamia and lasted for centuries. There was little evidence of war. Reciprocity and mutual aid were the norm. A warrior or priestly aristocracy never arose.\n\n7) The authors offer an interesting definition of the “state”, which they argue lacks academic consensus. They believe the social control of the state is based on a) control of violence; b) control of information; and c) a charismatic leader. They then go on to examine states that based their function of some combination of each of these. Notably, some of them were quasi-democratic, e.g. Choctaw and Cherokee tribes; some depended on military mastery, some on cultural. Traditional narratives assume chiefs control police to enforce rules and that writing is in service of the bureaucratic state, but this is not always the case.\n\nThere are too many examples to cover in this review and I had to strip them of nuance as it is. It is, quite simply, an overview of human endeavor and societies all the way up to the Enlightenment. They claim that social science as a discipline emerged in reaction to the failure of Enlightenment ideas to improve the lot of man as promised, indeed interventions often made the situation worse. Hence, the simplifying search for a “human nature”.\n\nThe authors conclude that much of what we take for granted as \"human nature\" is not borne out by the history of our early civilizations by counter-example, if not (perhaps) by statistical preponderance. Thus, the shape of our societies are not anywhere near as deterministic as we commonly assume. I find this a wonderfully liberating message. This seems to be a theme of many books I’ve read over the last 5 years, ranging from economics (and the form that modern capitalism has taken) to political science and even science fiction. As the philosophes argued, we can change our societies as much as they determine the kind of lives we lead. Reading this book over has inspired me to go further in pursuit of these directions. You can’t find a better recommendation than that. This is the best book I’ve read in the last year. By far.",
    "Origin myths the world over have a basic psychological effect: regardless of their scientific validity, they have the sly power of justifying existing states of affairs, while simultaneously contouring a perception of what the world might look like in the future. Modern capitalist society has built itself upon two variants of one such myth. As one story goes, life as primitive hunter-gatherers was ‘nasty, brutish and short’ until the invention of the state allowed us to flourish. The other story says that in their childlike state of nature, humans were happy and free, and that it was only with the advent of civilisation that ‘they all ran headlong to their chains’. These are two variants of the same myth because they both posit an unilinear historical trajectory, one that begins from simple egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands and ends with increasing social complexity and hierarchy. They also nurture a similar fatalistic perspective on the future: whether we go with Hobbes (the first) or Rousseau (the second), we are left with the idea that the most we can do to change our current predicament is, at best, a bit of modest political tinkering. Hierarchy and inequality are the inevitable price to pay for having truly come of age. Both versions of the myth picture the human past as a primordial soup of small bands of hunter-gatherers, lacking in vision and critical thought, and where nothing much happened until we embarked on the process that, with the advent of agriculture and the birth of cities, culminated in the modern Enlightenment.\n\nWhat makes Graeber and Wengrow’s The Dawn of Everything an instant classic is its comprehensive scientific demolition of this myth – what they call ‘the Myth of the Stupid Savage’. Not a shred of archaeological evidence tells us that the picture of the human past is remotely close to what the foundational myth suggests. Instead, what the available evidence shows is that the trajectory of human history has been a good deal more diverse and exciting and less boring than we tend to assume because, in an important sense, it has never been a trajectory. We never permanently lived in tiny hunter-gatherer bands. We also were never permanently egalitarian. If there is a defining trait of our prehistorical condition it is its bewildering capacity of shifting, almost constantly, across a diverse array of social systems of all kinds of political, economic, and religious nature. Graeber and Wengrow’s suggestion is that the only way to explain this kaleidoscopic variety of social forms is to assume that our ancestors were not actually that stupid, but were instead self-conscious political actors, capable of fashioning their own social arrangements depending on circumstances. More often than not, people would choose to switch seasonally between socio-political identities as to avoid the perils of lasting authoritarian power. And so, rather than asking ‘Why did inequality arise?’ the most interesting question to pose about human history becomes ‘Why did we get stuck with it?’ This is only one of many kindred claims advanced in this astounding new book.\n\nThe book draws much of its value from its eclectic approach. David Wengrow is a professor of comparative archaeology at UCL. He is well-known for his work on early cultural and political transformations in Africa and Eurasia. David Graeber, who died suddenly in September 2020, was a professor of anthropology at LSE, widely regarded as the most brilliant of his generation. Together, they explore a suite of recent archaeological findings that prove anomalous to the standard narrative (for instance, the existence of ancient large-scale egalitarian cities), but that, until now, had only been privy to a handful of experts who never quite unravelled the implications. Archaeological discoveries are therein appraised from anthropological eyes. The result is a sweeping tour into the past that hops from continent to continent and from one social sphere to another to tell stories that, depending on the reader’s familiarity with the archaeological record, might come as revelations.\n\nWe learn, for instance, that the uniformity in material culture across Eurasia in the Upper Palaeolithic meant that people lived in a large-scale imagined community spanning continents, putting to rest the idea that ‘primitives’ only spent their time in isolated bands. Counter-intuitively, the scale of single societies decreased over the course of human history as populations grew larger. From monumental sites such as Göbekli Tepe in Turkey or Hopewell in Ohio, we learn that people would seasonally come together from distant lands in what appear to have been large centres of cultural interactions for recreation and the exchange of knowledge. Journeying great distances while expecting to be welcomed into an extended community was a typical feature of our ancestors’ lives.\n\nThe book then pivots to agriculture. The received view has it that the birth of agriculture meant the more or less automatic emergence of stratified societies. Yet, this assumption runs into problems once we consider a phenomenon like ‘play farming’ across Amazonia, where acephalous societies like the Nambikwara, though familiar with techniques of plant domestication, consciously decided not to make agriculture the basis for their economy and to opt for a more relaxed approach that switched flexibly between foraging and cultivation. (Agriculture generally emerged in the absence of easier alternatives.) Further, we learn that some of the first agricultural societies of the Middle East formed themselves as egalitarian and peaceful responses to the predatory foragers of the surrounding hills. It was mostly women, here, that propelled the growth of agricultural science. We also learn that complex works of irrigation in some such places were executed communally without chiefs, and even where structures of hierarchy existed, these works were accomplished despite authority, not because of it. The gradual spread of agriculture across the globe was far less unilinear than anyone had previously guessed.\n\nIn what’s perhaps the best chapter of the book, the authors move on to examine cities. Nowadays, large-scale egalitarian cities, the mere idea of it, smacks of utopianism; but Graeber and Wengrow argue that it shouldn’t when we start thinking of cities as the coalescence, in a single physical space, of already existing extended imagined communities with their own egalitarian ethos and norms – first happening seasonally, then more stationarily, as conscious experiments in urban form. Sites like Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia and many others offer incontrovertible evidence of the past existence of such cities, where no sign of authoritarian rule can be found. (Generally, when these are found, they stand out in the form of palaces, temples, fortification, etc.) Other ancient cities like Cahokia in Mississippi or Shimao in China exhibit evidence of a temporal succession of different political orders, sometimes moving from authoritarian to egalitarian, which leaves the possibility of urban revolutions as a likely explanation for the change.\n\nThe final chapters focus on the ‘state’. Or better, on how misleading it is to define societies like the Inka or the Aztecs as ‘incipient states’ because these were far more diverse than what this straitjacket term would make us think. From the Olmec and the Chavin societies in Mesoamerica to the Shilluk of South Sudan, The Dawn of Everything offers a taste of the variety of authoritarian structures throughout history. By the end of the book, we encounter the archaeological gem that is Minoan Crete – a ‘beautiful irritant for archaeology’ – where all evidence points to the existence of an ancient system of female political rule, most likely a theocracy run by a college of priestesses.\n\nThere is much more. The leitmotif running through the chapters is that if we want to make sense of all these phenomena, we are obliged to put human collective intentionality back into the picture of human history, as a genuine explanatory variable. To assume, that is, that our ancestors were imaginative beings who were eminently capable of self-consciously creating their social arrangements. The authors by no means discount the importance of ecological determinants. Rather, they see their effort as moving the dial to a more sensible position within the agency–determinism continuum, which usually only takes one extreme. The key upshot is that this newfound view of our past equips us with an expanded sense of possibilities as to what we might do with ourselves in the future. Fatalistic sentiments about human nature melt away upon turning the pages.\n\nStaying true to Ostrom’s law – ‘whatever works in practice must work in theory’ – Graeber and Wengrow set out a new framework for interpreting the social reality brought to light by empirical findings. Firstly, they urge us to abandon terms like ‘simple’ or ‘complex’ societies, let alone the ‘origin of the state’ or ‘origin of social complexity’. These terms already presuppose the kind of teleological thinking challenged in the book. The same goes for ‘modes of production’: whether a society relies on farming or fishing is a poor criterion for classification because it tells us almost nothing about its social dynamics. Secondly, they lay out some new descriptive categories of their own. They show, for instance, that social domination can be broken down into three elements – control of violence, control of knowledge, and charismatic power – and that permutations of these elements yield consistent patterns throughout history. While the modern nation state embodies all three, most hierarchical societies of the past had only one or two, and this allowed for the people who lived under them degrees of freedom that are barely imaginable for us today.\n\nGraeber and Wengrow reflect at length on this last point. More than a work on the history of inequality, The Dawn of Everything is a treatise on human freedom. In parsing the anthropological record, they identify three types of freedom – freedom to abandon one’s community (knowing one will be welcomed in faraway lands), freedom to reshuffle the political system (often seasonally), and freedom to disobey authorities without consequences – that appear to have been simply assumed by our ancestors but are now largely lost (obviously, their conclusion is a far cry from Rousseau’s: there is nothing inevitable about this loss!). This analysis flips the question one should really be asking about the historical development of hierarchy: “The real puzzle is not when chiefs first appeared”, they suggest, “but rather when it was no longer possible to simply laugh them out of court.”\n\nSo much of what makes this book fascinating is the alien nature of what we encounter within, at least to contemporary eyes. Potlaches, headhunting and skull portraits, stranger kings, revolutions, shamanic art, vision quests… The Dawn of Everything reads like a work of sci-fi, except that what turns out to be fictional is our received view of human history. The writing is often funny, sometimes hilarious. At the same time, because hardly a paragraph goes by without bequeathing insight, this is a book that needs to be patiently taken in. It sits in a different class to all the other volumes on world history we are accustomed to reading.\n\nThe Dawn of Everything intellectually dwarfs the likes of Pinker, Diamond, or Fukuyama (and Harari too). Whenever non-specialists try their hands at human history, they inevitably end up reproducing the same old myths we have grown up with. Consider Steven Pinker: for all his talk about scientific progress, his books might as well have been written at the times of Hobbes, in the 17th century, when none of the evidence unearthed recently was available. Graeber and Wengrow casually expose these popular authors’ startling incompetence at handling the anthropological record. Only a solid command of the latter – namely, of the full documented range of human possibilities – affords a credible interpretative lens over the distant past. For it supplies the researcher with a refined sense of the rhythms of human history.\n\nOne of the experiences of delving into this book, at least in my case, was a gradual recognition of being in the presence of an intellectual oddity, something difficult to situate within the current landscape of social theory. By embracing once again the ‘grand narrative’, the book makes a clean break with post-structuralist and post-humanist trends widespread in contemporary academia. We know that Graeber, at least, liked to think himself as a ‘pre-humanist’, actively expecting to see humanity realise its full potential. One can certainly see this work as a contribution in that direction. One can also see The Dawn of Everything as belonging to the tradition of the Enlightenment (except that one of the other major claims in the book is that Enlightenment thought developed largely in response to indigenous intellectuals’ critiques of European society of the time). As for how it squares with current archaeological and anthropological theory, the book is of such a real sweep that I don’t think it admits easy comparisons.\n\nIf comparisons must be made, they should be made with works of similar calibre in other fields, most credibly, I venture, with the works of Galileo or Darwin. Graeber and Wengrow do to human history what the first two did to astronomy and biology respectively. The book produces a similar decentring effect: in dethroning our self-appointed position at the pinnacle of social evolution, it deals a blow to the teleological thinking that so insidiously shape our understanding of history. With the exception that while works such as Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems and On the Origin of Species hinted at the relative insignificance of humans in the face of the cosmos, The Dawn of Everything explores all the possibilities we have to act within it. And if Galileo and Darwin stirred turmoil of their own, this will do even more so for precisely this reason. Ultimately, a society that accepts the story presented here as its official origin story – a story that is taught in its schools, that seeps into its public consciousness – will have to be radically different than the society we are currently living in.",
    "Truly a fascinating book. Offers a wonderful counter narrative to the writers such as Diamond, Yuvel Noah, Pinker about the origins of mankind etc using evidence not often cited from those readers. Defiantly worth a read.",
    "A lengthy, interesting and well-researched exploration of the overlooked dynamism and diversity of our social, economic and political solutions to survival. It spans the period of our distant prehistory to around 1000 years ago and touches, to varying degrees, on socio-cultural forms on every continent. The anthropological and archaeological gloss is revealing and underscores the sheer variability in forms of human cooperation, coercion and corruption. At it’s core though the book is not primarily about the almost irresolvable mysteries of our past and the age-old tensions between personal freedom, social justice and power. Rather the author’s seem more preoccupied with wanting to make the case for the historical and ethical legitimacy of a variety of anarchism, evidence of which appear to have arisen in the last 13,000 years. In this way, the book borders on polemic with political intent. This is a fascinating and sometimes compelling thesis, which begs the question of how we have lost some of this dynamism and diversity and gotten ‘stuck’ within a particular, globalising, homogenising power structure that not only entrenches extremely asymmetrical social relations, but also decouples our survival solutions from environmental patterns and parameters. I like this preceding thought-provoking aspect of the book, but I feel that the authors miss something really important along the way, namely the cosmological dimension. Their materialist, atheism (which is fine) seems to however diminish their imagination in regards the organising force of cosmological (and ideological) beliefs in our pre/history. People do the strangest and most amazing things in the name of supernatural and metaphysical beliefs. David Abram’s explanations of animism for instance, point to an organising force in our prehistory which helps to elucidate some of the impetus behind stateless acts of collaboration. I feel that the book seems to want to avoid this dimension and thereby misses an important source of the persistence of power forms. The Egyptian case is only amongst the most physically and hyperbolically manifest examples of despotic power generated via a social, economic and political commitment to the significance of the afterlife. Assuaging the gods for our survival is surely the most basic rationale for these charismatic, excessive displays which are eventually ritualised into state bureaucracy. I would still recommend this as an alternative to the more popular linear renditions of the evolution of power provided by S. Pinker, Jared Diamond and Yuval Harari.",
    "Not finished yet - but I have really enjoyed discovering the intelligence and wisdom of our prehistoric ancestors over very many thousands of years - and of so-called ‘Primitive’ peoples more recently colonised.\nBest so far: Accounts from the huge archive of Jesuit Missionary records of their encounters with indigenous Americans when the French first colonised Nova Scotia, Quebec etc. - complaining that the awkward souls argued with greater independence of mind and clarity than the French people back home!\nI am really delighted to read so much about the rationality and good values of our ancestors and fellow humans - with some sadness that so many of us do not recognise the chains we have allowed to imprison our minds.",
    "The Dawn of Everything is a gift and love-letter to the human race. It documents the creativity and resourcefulness of communities and cultures at all stages of history, in terms of devising many different forms of self-government. It offers hope that, in these terrible and diffficult times, we may collectively be able to build a different way of living together."

    "I heard about this book a number of times before I finally bought it. But it wasn’t the number of people who mentioned it that impressed me; it was the way they spoke of it, definitely in admiration, almost in awe, always with a tone that suggested they had been changed by the experience. What better recommendation could there be? I had to read it.\n\nThe book follows Stevenson’s career first as a Harvard law student, and continuing after he received his degree, defending people (primarily in Alabama) who would otherwise have little hope of justice. Even with the efforts of Stevenson and others working to bring the ideal of equal justice closer to reality, there are aspects of a person’s life, some of which that person cannot control, that demonstrably affect his or her interaction with the massive machinery of justice in America. To summarize Stevenson’s argument: If you are poor, black, or mentally ill, your chances of receiving fair treatment in the justice system are much worse, especially if the victim is white.\n\nOf course, racial discrimination is still present in American society and still causes untold damage, but one thing that struck me while reading this book was the reminder of how recent the history of overt racial discrimination is in our country. By this I mean discrimination that doesn’t even hide itself, that isn’t even subtle, that is just right there in your face, never mind what the law might say. This history runs deep in America, and it still has the effect of denying many people the benefits of a nation that promises “liberty and justice for all.” In particular, as it relates to Stevenson’s book, African Americans who are caught up in the justice system have to carry a heavy burden of history, whether they are guilty or not.\n\nAddressing this burden is the aim of Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative. Stevenson and his colleagues don’t only defend African Americans who have no access to good legal representation. They have worked with white convicts as well, in addition to showing a special interest in the mentally ill and children convicted of serious crimes and thrown in together with the general prison population. But race and the history of race relations, including a history of state-sanctioned violence against African Americans, are the broad context for the work. It is a context that I think is difficult for white Americans, especially privileged white Americans, to fully understand.\n\nThe frame story for Stevenson’s book, the story that encompasses all the others and provides a thread of continuity, is the saga of Walter McMillian. McMillian was convicted and sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit, based on flimsy and highly questionable evidence that was contradicted by other evidence and testimony available to police and prosecutors at the time of the original trial. Imprisoned on Alabama’s death row in 1987 before the trial even began, McMillian was eventually released in 1993 through the efforts of Stevenson and the EJI. But while McMillian’s case is described from beginning to end over the course of the book, Stevenson describes many other cases, some successful, some not, that he handled over the years.\n\nAs infuriating as McMillian’s story is, though, the main point of the book is not that a man named Walter McMillian was unjustly imprisoned and prejudicially sentenced to die. Yes, his exoneration was a belated correction of a grievous error, and it saved an innocent man from death, but there are two larger messages embedded in these accounts of underfunded attempts to right past wrongs and, in the case of children, to ensure that they are not permanently damaged by being incarcerated with hardened criminals. First is that there is a real human being at the core of each of the stories Stevenson tells, and each of them deserves the fair treatment that any of us would expect, even demand, of the justice system. It is said so often that it can sound corny, but even one innocent person wrongfully convicted is too many, and if that person is put to death it is inexcusable both legally and morally (especially if the case was mishandled). Stevenson notes in a Postscript that when Anthony Ray Hinton was freed from prison in 2015, after being “locked down in solitary confinement at Holman Correctional Facility [in Alabama] for three decades in a 5x7 cell” for a crime he did not commit, he was the “152nd person in America exonerated and proved innocent after having been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death” (p. 315). One hundred and fifty-two people! How can we as a nation continue to argue that the death penalty is a useful part of a system of justice when over 150 innocent people have been condemned but had the good fortune to be proven innocent before the process could reach its culmination in their death? It is unknown how many innocent people have actually been executed, but if this many have been freed after being proven innocent, we should lose some sleep—lots of it—over that unanswerable question. It’s not good enough to say that because in the end they were exonerated, the cases of these 152 people prove that the system works. The point is that they never should have been convicted in the first place. Far too many of these people were convicted due to incompetent representation, withheld evidence, and prejudicial hearings, and were only saved because a lawyer somewhere had time to take their case (most likely for little or no pay, since those wrongfully convicted tend to be poor). For those not so lucky, the execution chamber awaits.\n\nThe second message is that it does not weaken our justice system to remember that justice tempered with mercy is not a lesser form of justice. I have great faith in the American justice system, a faith that has been reinforced by living in countries that have different systems. Yes, it takes a little longer to look objectively at all the evidence. And it is difficult for all of us to look beyond our preconceptions and see the person in front of us rather than the category into which we would place them. But that is what our common humanity requires of us. And when fallible human beings, including the state’s representatives (judges, prosecutors, juries of one’s peers), are making decisions that could end a person’s life, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we do all we can not to allow mistakes to be made that cannot be undone once the sentence is carried out. False charges can be reversed. Unjust imprisonment can end. But nothing ends the gas chamber, the electric chair, or the lethal injection until the heart and lungs stop functioning. Stevenson isn’t suggesting that killers go free, or that criminals should not be punished. His larger message about mercy is simply this: We all need it from time to time, and we may even need more than we deserve. As he puts it, “we are all broken by something. We have all hurt someone and have been hurt. We all share the condition of brokenness even if our brokenness is not equivalent” (p. 289). But it’s not just that we all have our often-hidden sources of pain. It’s that we most often need mercy when we deserve it least. “The power of just mercy is that it belongs to the undeserving. It’s when mercy is least expected that it’s most potent—strong enough to break the cycle of victimization and victimhood, retribution and suffering” (p. 294).\n\nSome would ask, but what about people who don’t deserve mercy? What about people who, by their own actions, have put themselves beyond the bounds of human decency and thereby forfeited their right to continue living among us? One response would sound a bit like a Sunday School lesson, at least if you’re a Christian. By that doctrine, none of us deserves mercy. It’s always a gift, given because of the love and grace of the Giver, not because of the merits of the one to whom it is given. But it’s hard to apply such a lesson to the criminal justice system, because the great Lawgiver isn’t dispensing justice in that system. We are. And I mean that “we” literally. We are all implicated when any decision is made in the courts, since the foundation on which those courts rest is the idea that in determining guilt and innocence, and setting punishments in the case of the former, they act as our surrogates, expressing the unacceptability of certain acts but also accepting the possibility that sometimes, the person in the dock just might be innocent. At the conclusion of his story of Walter McMillian, Stevenson concludes with a lesson he said he learned from the experience. “Mercy is most empowering, liberating, and transformative when it is directed at the undeserving. The people who haven’t earned it, who haven’t even sought it, are the most meaningful recipients of our compassion.” He’s not talking about Walter McMillian’s liberation from prison, though. He’s talking about Walter’s own forgiveness of “the people who had judged him unworthy of mercy” (p. 314).\n\nSo what is required of us as citizens of a country with a legal system designed to protect us from the depredations of those who would harm us while also protecting us as much as possible from the perversions of justice that will be part of any imperfect system administered by imperfect people? We might start with this: To do justice and love mercy. In practice, the systems of state power cannot be expected to operate perfectly, but we can insist on certain things from those systems: a fair, impartial hearing; consideration of all the evidence, whether or not it supports one side’s vested interest in a particular outcome; refusal to apply the law any differently regardless of race or prior history. When those in a position to decide on our behalf decide that the ultimate penalty is to be applied, we can refuse to let the human thirst for vengeance make us callous to the tragedy that has unfolded for everyone, from the victims to the perpetrator. And when a wrongly-convicted person is freed, we can find within us a willingness to accept him or her as we would like to be accepted, as one whose failings are part of the enormous burden of our common, fallible humanity.",
    "Have you ever read a book that has changed the way you view the world? Just Mercy was that book for me. Bryan Stevenson has spent his life helping those that have been wrongly condemned.\n\nDid you know that “over 50 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States have a diagnosed mental illness, a rate nearly five times greater than that of the general adult population?” Did you know that 25 percent of inmates are veterans? Did you know that there were children sentenced to life in prison for non-lethal crimes at the age of 13? Did you know that 167 people that were on death row have been exonerated since 1973 in the United States? I did not know any of this before reading Just Mercy. It was an eye-opening book that taught me a lot about the prison system and execution in the United States. Even more than the facts and figures, Bryan Stevenson was able to use the personal stories of those that he has worked with through the years to give a face to the people behind bars. These stories still haunt me a week after finishing this book.\n\nThe main story of Just Mercy is how Stevenson founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice, to help defend the wrongly convicted, the poor, and the vulnerable that have become trapped in the criminal justice system. Walter McMillian was one of Stevenson’s first cases. He was condemned for a murder he did not commit, and Stevenson has to work against the system to try to get just for Walter, his family, and his community. I will admit I was shocked that you could be so innocent with an alibi and no prior convictions and that false testimony could put you on death row. The fact that it was so hard to get Walter back off death row was very disturbing and made me question again why we have the death penalty in America.\n\nI admire Bryan Stevenson. Instead of taking a high paying corporate job, he went after his passion to help people. The way he tells his story is down to earth and full of compassion. It made me really sad reading this how happy people were to see Bryan when he visited them in jail. He was the one person that really listened to so many forgotten people. People want justice and mercy and he was able to bring it to a lot of people.\n\nAs a side note, I really liked the To Kill a Mockingbird references in this book. It was highly ironic that a community that was so proud of being where To Kill a Mockingbird took place railroaded a black man, Walter McMillian, with false testimony to a death sentence.\n\nI also watched the movie Just Mercy on Amazon with my family. It was an excellent movie. It focused on the Walter McMillian case and not the rest of the stories that Stevenson told in this book. The book covered a lot of issues including mothers that are put in jail for “killing” babies that were born dead, children that are victimized as they are tried as adults and put in the general population. The book also talked about how being tough on crime often results in sentences that are too harsh for the crimes, especially for the poor. The rich who can afford good lawyers are able to plea deal and get out of sentences that the poor could spend a lifetime in prison over. The system is not fair for all. Even after a citizen pays for their crime, when they get out of jail, there are so many restrictions they are not able to be a fully functioning citizen of the United States again. That is a crime in itself. I also watched the documentary “13th” on Netflix and Bryan Stevenson is one of the people interviewed about the criminal justice system in America. It was also eye opening and I highly recommend it.\n\nFavorite Quotes:\nI had too many favorite quotes in this book so I will try to narrow it down.\n\n“This book is about getting closer to mass incarceration and extreme punishment in America. It is about how easily we condemn people in this county and the injustice we create when we allow fear, anger, and distance to shape the way we treat the most vulnerable among us.”\n\n“The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned. We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, and a nation. Fear and anger can make us vindictive and abusive, unjust and unfair, until we all suffer from the absence of mercy and we condemn ourselves as much as we victimize others. The closer we get to mass incarceration and extreme levels of punishment, the more I believe it’s necessary to recognize that we all need mercy, we all need justice, and – perhaps – we all need some measure of unmerited grace.”\n\n“For them, the darkness brought a familiar unease, an uncertainty weighted with the wary, lingering fear as old as the settlement of the country itself; discomfort too longstanding and constant to merit discussion but too burdensome to ever forget.”\n\n“The bad things that happen to use don’t define us.”\n\n“Whenever things got really bad, and they were questioning the value of their lives, I would remind them that each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.”\n\n“Constantly being suspected, accused, doubted, distrusted, presumed guilty, and even feared is a burden borne by a people of color that can’t be understood or confronted without a deeper conversation about our history of racial injustice.”\n\n“Walter made me understand why we have to reform a system of criminal justice that continues to treat people better if they are rich and guilty than if they are poor and innocent.”\n\nOverall, Just Mercy is a book that every American should read. Stevenson is able to give a voice to those that desperately need one that are trapped within our legal system. It also gives a great look at why there is so much anger in our country right now with how different groups (black, mentally disabled, poor, etc.) are treated different within our justice system. I read this book quickly and I cannot stop thinking about it. It is a great book for a book club or a school to discuss social justice issues.\n\nBook Source: Purchased from Amazon.com",
    "As a white English woman I have limited knowledge of the British justice system and next to none of the American systems. I have no knowledge of worrying about healthcare issues as ours is free, so don't have to stop and think before I call the doctor or an ambulance. I also have no real knowledge of racism. The facts in this account are heartbreaking. It is unbelievable that we can treat people this way. That anyone can be thrown into prison for life without parole is dreadful, let alone that it could be a 13year old child or a woman writing cheques for which she has no money to honour. What kind of world is this?! Bryan writes in a gentle, eloquent tone; he doesn't lecture, or bang his fist, and as such it is a very readable book, even if the truths are not palatable. Well done for all your incredible struggles Mr Stevenson and thank you for writing this book so that I and the rest of the world may be educated. May we be brave enough to catch stones henceforth.",
    "This book tells the story of Bryan Stevenson's attempts to help those on death row in the US, particularly those in the state of Alabama where he sets up an Equal Justice Initiative. One three through the book is the story of Walter McMillian, wrongly convicted of murder who spends 6 years on death row before he is finally released by the efforts of Stevenson. Other chapters deal with other cases - and the issues around treating juveniles as adults in the US justice system of the day, of making no allowance for mental disabilities, and through it all, ongoing prejudice against black people and poor people built into the judicial system.\n\nI learned much I did not know - that judges in many US states run for office and are elected, for example. This leads to competition to be the toughest on crime in terms of sentencing. And much about US history - Stevenson persuasively suggests there have been four eras of history in the US, that of slavery, that of terrorism (lynching, the Ku Klux Klan etc) following Reconstruction, that of Jim Crow (institutionalised apartheid), and now an era of mass imprisonment. I was also reminded of much that is worst in human nature as well as about much that is best. Stevenson says 'we are all broken' in different ways. There are telling anecdotes from his own life - being stopped by the police for now reason while in his car late at night near his home and having a gun pointed at him and then an illegal search of his car, being mistaken by a judge for a criminal rather than a defence attorney because he is black. Much of the book is very moving. Just possibly the worst is over with several Supreme Court victories, and some decline in the imposition of the death penalty in very recent years...\n\nSo: I'd simply recommend this very strongly to all others.",
    "As someone who works in the British Criminal justice system I am always interested in comparison between our CJS and that of the US, which was originally designed to emulate ours. The vast difference in sentencing policy has always been staggering and made me grateful of our more liberal sentencing practices. Reading about the experiences of BAME communities and the US CJS made me angry and offended my sense of justice; until I read statistics that show that proportionately we are overtaking the US in our locking up of black males. This book has reaffirmed that justice is more readily available to those who can pay for it and solidified my position that the death penalty, either through execution or slow death in custody is both immoral and detracts from one of the most human of virtues...mercy.",
    "This is one of the most impressive books I have read for a very long time. The author, an African American from a poor background, is a lawyer who works tirelessly to defend the rights of his mainly black clients, especially those on death row and some children as young as thirteen years, who receive sentences of life without parole.\n\nHis is a remarkable story of courage, persistence, and sheer humanity, and his work is now rightly recognised throughout the world. The book is not a comfortable read; many of his clients have suffered appalling injustice and abuse, and he pulls no punches in writing about them. But the book also includes stories of enormous courage and forgiveness, as well as of heartbreak and tragedy. One character in particular stands out, as we follow his story from wrongful conviction as a young man through numerous appeals and setbacks. Stevenson points out that even now, a white guilty man stands a better chance of finding justice than one who is black and innocent, and he challenges a society that identifies people by the worst thing they have done, ignoring the good.\n\nFor some years, I have corresponded with a prisoner on Texas death row facing execution, and I know from his letters some of the devastating effects of years of solitary confinement, without any opportunity for redemption, so this book was of especial interest to me. But to all who are in favour of - as well as against - the death penalty, I would say read this book. It is a real eye-opener, as well as giving shocking insight into the judicial system of the United States, who have the highest rate of imprisonment in the entire world. The link below leads to a speech by Stevenson, which describes some of what can be found in his remarkable book.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/17/bryan-stevenson-if-its-not-right-to-a-rapist-how-can-it-be-ok-to-kill-a-killer",
    "I first came across Bryan Stevenson when watching his interview on Democracy Now (www.democracynow.org) talking about Ferguson. This book made me, a white Brit, aware of how deep-rooted the problems in America's judicial system are. Hopefully the imprint this book will have on me is that it will make me a little more human, a little more merciful. I'd recommend this book for anyone - and particularly for schools. I think today's primary kids should read this stuff and maybe be encouraged to forge a better world for themselves."

    "For a while, I was seeing this book literally everywhere. I thought it was going to be a typical food memoir, kind of like Nigel Slater's TOAST, and while parts of it were that, about halfway through it undergoes a total tonal shift, where the focus is entirely on her mother's end of life, the stress it put on her relationships, the mental breakdowns it caused, and the agony of seeing someone you love go slowly and painfully as they shed their sense of self. It's incredibly painful and I don't think the summary fully conveys how traumatic this book could be to someone who is losing or has recently lost a loved one. The summary describes this book as having \"humor and heart,\" and while it certainly possessed plenty of the later, I had difficulty finding any of the former.\n\nCRYING IN H MART is about Michelle Zauner's identity as a half-Korean/American. Her mother was her anchor to Korean culture, and her entre into the culture was primarily through food. The book opens with her walking through H Mart and talking about how food is a bonding experience in so many different kinds of relationships, and she talks about some of the memories certain dishes gave her. This is a constant theme throughout the book, although it is not as food-focused as the first chapter would have you believe.\n\nI liked the raw honesty with which she talked about her family. The alienation she felt from Korean culture because she couldn't speak the language and the existential crisis she had when losing her mother (and therefore, by proxy, part of herself) was powerful and tragic. I also liked how she talked about the ugly side of grief and mourning. All too often, when grief is portrayed, it's as a unifying experience; but sometimes, as it does in this book, it ends up driving people apart and making them selfish. There are different ways to express grief or to mourn, and it was nice to see that here.\n\nApart from the slightly misleading presentation, I really liked this book. I don't think I'd want to read it again but the way that the author described food and relationships was great.\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars",
    "This is hard to explain. I am also Half Korean and Half White raised by my Korean Mother. I thought this book was a niche audience book but it touches and connects people through memory, love, loss and grief for their loved ones. The commonality of struggles of youth, untamed ambition and independence, the yearning for return of fond happier memories as we become older and realize our losses. The difference here for me as part of the niche audience is the specific cultural and ethnic aspects of being a second generation mixed race Korean Amerasian. I shared much of her problems with identity as a mixed race Korean. Many people with immigrant parents can relate to this story but this story was so specific for me. Certain aspects of the Korean Culture, some language involved but most of all……the food. The food is extremely important to any child of a mother born and raised in Korea. We are raised with it and bond with our families and Korean friends with it. Korean Food is extremely important socially. Her analogies with it and use of it in her grief to connect with better memories to recover from trauma were a genius part of her writing but also rang true for me. Where was this author for me 20 years ago? I NEVER had a book impact my life like this one has. I had a falling out with my Korean Mother and my sister and stopped communicating with them for two years until just this past year before I read the book. After reading the book it made all my grievances seem so petty in the grand scheme of things in life and had so many deep regrets. I had to call my mom and sister and tell them how much I loved and appreciated them. I sent them the book and now they understand and we’re so much closer because of it. I spent 8 years in the Army, 1 tour as an Army ER Nurse in Iraq, 2,5 years in Oncology and over 20 in ER and I thought I was tough…….but I cried like a baby through this book. I have sent this book to numerous friends. I couldn’t stop talking about this book and her music as well it was so good. Give the book to someone who may appreciate the book as a gift. A mother and daughter having trouble with eachother? Give the daughter the book first and see if anything changes. Friend’s mother passed of a terminal illness? This book can be very cathartic and comforting in the sharing of grief and memories. This book hit me like no other in my life.",
    "In my humble opinion, I honestly believe the critical reviews of this book are just because this book wasn’t meant to resonate with them on a personal level. I don’t believe you need to be a foodie to read this book either. While Zauner never overly describes all the dishes her mother or family member prepares, google can send you down a wonderful Korean food hole if you need deeper insight and a slight break from the memoir if you need to truly get a grasp of what dishes she’s describing. It gives you a delightful peek into traditional Korean dishes that you might not have any idea about.\n\nAs a bi-racial Asian American myself, there was a few parts of the book that completely hit home for me and made me feel seen. It also made me think really hard about several concepts I’d never thought about in life and how my children might view me as a mother once I’m gone.\n\nI don’t believe that Zauner ever resented her mother as some people mentioned, I think it takes a greater understanding into Asian culture and style of parenting to fully understand some of her points in the book.\n\nOverall, this was a heart breaking and heartwarming story to read and a great insight into Korean cuisine. My only critique would be it feels a little scattered in some areas where it took me a moment to figure out when and where in her timeline, events or moments were taking place, but overall I highly recommend!",
    "Last year, I committed to reading one memoir every month and have since enjoyed some fascinating, real-life stories, some of the celebrity kind, but mostly about ordinary people and their extraordinary experiences.\n\nThis account by Michelle Zauner disappointingly falls into neither category. In terms of “memoir,” it mostly revolves around the death of her mother from colon cancer, with some references to the challenges of being biracial and connecting with her Korean roots.\n\nBy far the greatest part of the book, however, is taken up by descriptions of Korean food: buying the ingredients, preparing and cooking them, and then eating the final dishes. Whole pages devoted to gushing prose about this or that culinary experience.\n\nOkay, so food was the thing that connected Zauner to her mother. But, I got that message within the first two chapters. I didn’t need it rammed down my throat ad nauseum. About half way through, I started skipping the “foodie” pages completely.\n\nZauner can write; there’s no doubt about that. The chapters describing her mother’s slow decline and death are visceral and poignant. But, the book as a whole feels terribly self-indulgent. There is nothing in it that is particularly remarkable; no profound insights or lessons.\n\nMy feeling is that Zauner wrote this “memoir” as a form of personal catharsis. And if she achieved this, then I’m happy for her. For me, though, the hype is totally overblown. Except, perhaps, if you’re keen to know how to cook authentic Korean food.\n\nThanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful. You can find more candid book reviews on my Amazon profile page.",
    "Lovely, meaningful, sad, emotional book. Recommended. Michelle also makes FANTASTIC music - check out 'Jubilee' by her band Japanese Breakfast (my album of 2021).",
    "A beautifully written book where food and love of a dying mother come together, effecting greater understanding. Just a little tedious hearing so much about the food, hence 4 not 5, but a good read nonetheless.",
    "I loved this. As someone who also had a tangled relationship with her mother, it resonated with me. Gorgeous descriptions of cooking and food and how it brings back memories.",
    "This book makes you feel things. I read it all in one day and will read it again. I would recommend this to anyone who likes an emotional story."

    "This 2021 book entitled \"The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story” by Nikole Hannah-Jones is a well-written scholarly account of enslaved people, indeed the world; the book is an outgrowth and expansion of a New Times Magazine story written in 2019 for the 400 year anniversary of 1619. It includes extensive references and powerful accounts of great things that enslaved people contributed and how at times they were systematically treated poorly. I provides suggestions for righting past wrongs and while parts are informative, factual and entertaining, some views are unlikely to be in the main stream of how to move forward; nonetheless, the book is thought provoking and worth purchasing and reading.\nIllustrative of the style and substance of the author, Hannah-Jones writes: “This book uses a variety of terms to describe aspects of the era of slavery. In almost every case, the editors have avoided the word “slave” to describe persons held in bondage; the alternate term “enslaved person” accurately conveys the condition without stripping the individual of his or her humanity.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “African people had lived here, on the land that in 1776 would form the United States, since the White Lion dropped anchor in the year 1619. They’d arrived one year before the iconic ship carrying the English people who got the credit for building it all… Why hadn’t any teacher or textbook, in telling the story of Jamestown, taught us the story of 1619?... The year… white Virginians first purchased enslaved Africans, the start of American slavery, an institution so influential and corrosive that it both helped create the nation and nearly led to its demise, is indisputably a foundational historical date. And yet I’d never heard of it before.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “One of the reasons American children so poorly understand the history and legacy of slavery is because the adults charged with teaching them don’t know it very well, either… “The simple truth is that most Americans know little about the three-hundred-year history of slavery in mainland North America with respect to peoples of African descent and almost nothing of its effect on the majority of white Americans.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “I wanted people to know the date 1619 and to contemplate what it means that slavery predates nearly every other institution in the United States…. “Conveniently left out of our founding mythology,” that paragraph began, “is the fact that one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.”…The assertions about the role slavery played in the American Revolution shocked many of our [Magazine] readers… In July 2020, a prominent U.S. senator, Tom Cotton, introduced a bill called the “Saving American History Act,” which sought to strip federal funding from public schools teaching the 1619 Project.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “After the [Magazine] special issue’s publication, as people across the political spectrum debated the 1619 Project, we began to think about turning it into a book… we included more information in other chapters about slavery elsewhere in the Americas that predated 1619. We also added seven new essays written by historians, on subjects ranging from slavery and the Second Amendment to settler colonialism and the expansion of slavery to how the Haitian Revolution helped to deeply embed fear of Black Americans in the national psyche.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “Eight in ten Black people would not be in the United States were it not for the institution of slavery in a society founded on ideals of freedom… The 1619 Project seeks to explain this present-day reality and challenge these myths not to tear down or further divide this country, as some critics suggest, but so that we can truly become the country we already claim to be… August 1619… A ship arrives near Point Comfort, a coastal port in the English colony of Virginia, which was founded twelve years earlier. The White Lion carries some twenty to thirty captive Africans, who are traded to the Virginia colonists for provisions, making them the first enslaved Africans in the English colonies that will become the United States… that August day mark the beginning of slavery in the thirteen colonies that would become the United States of America. They were among the more than 12.5 million Africans who would be kidnapped from their homes and brought in chains across the Atlantic Ocean in the largest forced migration in human history until the Second World War.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “No one voluntarily submits to slavery. Enslaved people had always resisted. They broke tools, slowed down their work, and self-emancipated by stealing themselves away… Over the course of the war, thousands of enslaved people would join the British—far outnumbering those who joined the Patriot cause… And yet none of this is part of our founding mythology, which conveniently omits the fact that one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “our nation’s founding documents were written in Philadelphia, they were mainly written by Virginians… And it was Virginia tobacco, cultivated and harvested by enslaved workers, that was exported to help finance the Revolution… It is, therefore, not incidental that ten of this nation’s first twelve presidents were enslavers. In fact, some might argue that this nation was founded not as a democracy but as a slavocracy… Even so, the founders were deeply conflicted over slavery…”\nHannah-Jones writes: “enslaved people in the colony of Saint-Domingue—which was the… most lucrative colony in the world at the time and later became known as Haiti—rose up and overthrew their French enslavers in the largest and most successful rebellion of enslaved people in the history of the Western Hemisphere… With independence, the founding fathers could no longer blame slavery on Britain…”\nHannah-Jones writes: “On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final version of the Emancipation Proclamation… An astounding 78 percent of free Black military-age men living in free states would serve in the Union army, even as they faced greater risk than white soldiers… During this nation’s brief period of Reconstruction, from 1865 to 1877, formerly enslaved people zealously engaged with the democratic process. The role Black Americans played in bringing about Reconstruction has often been overlooked, because until 1870 and the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which finally granted Black men the right to vote, no Black people had ever been allowed to serve in any elected office in the U.S. Congress or in most states… In 1868, Congress ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, ensuring citizenship to Black Americans and all people born in the United States… Today, thanks to this amendment, every child born here, and all their progeny thereafter, gains automatic citizenship… Finally, in 1870, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment, establishing the most critical aspect of democracy and citizenship—the right to vote—to all men regardless of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.””\nHannah-Jones writes: “But even though cotton and tobacco dominated the colonial American economy, it was sugar that anchored the economy of the larger Atlantic world from the sixteenth century onward… “White gold,” as sugar was called, drove trade in goods and people, fueled the wealth of European nations, and, for the British in particular, shored up the financing of the North American colonies.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “From the earliest traces of cane domestication… sugar was locally consumed and remained little more than an exotic spice… for elite palates… This was in part because it was incredibly labor-intensive to produce. To achieve scale for export and trade, cane required tremendous coerced and coordinated human labor in warm climates and on fertile land… by 1672, King Charles II had conferred a monopoly on the Royal African Company specifically for the slave trade… to build the single most successful transatlantic slave-trading institution in history… This became known as the Middle Passage, since it was the middle leg of the triangular route. Arriving in Barbados… or Jamaica, the ships would exchange people for sugar, molasses, and lumber. From there they would return home to England, completing the last part of the triangle… The voracious appetite for wealth creation and the unyielding desire for sugar combined to create the foundation of the modern world. From the first time Royal African Company slavers set sail for North America, through the years of the American Revolution, until the abolition of the international slave trade in 1808, roughly three million souls,.. would be forcibly removed from their homes, their kin, and their way of life, the majority of them to feed demand for a sweetener… Sugar was incredibly profitable, but molasses became an indispensable exchange commodity, too. It was crucial to the manufacturing of desserts, sweet rolls and buns, and other processed foods. It was also the key ingredient in the making of rum… make millions of gallons of rum, which American-built slave ships, often called “rum vessels,” brought to West Africa, among other places, to trade for African captives.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “One of the major contributors to the booming Louisiana sugar industry was the Haitian Revolution… French… planters and their enslaved expert sugar workers poured into Louisiana… By the 1850s, Louisiana planters were producing a quarter of the world’s cane-sugar supply. During her antebellum reign, Queen Sugar bested King Cotton locally, making Louisiana the second-richest state in per capita wealth… in 1840 the state ranked third in banking capital, behind New York and Massachusetts… Louisiana led the nation in destroying the lives of Black people in the name of economic efficiency… Life expectancy was lower than on a cotton plantation and closer to that of a Jamaican cane field, where [enslaved] could drop dead after seven years of labor.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “By the late 1720s, slave patrolling in the Carolina colony had become a fundamental part of the militia’s regular duties… primarily engaged in “watching, catching, or beating black slaves.”… South Carolina officials arrested more than 150 Black people, publicly hanging ten per day… In the years that followed, South Carolina’s Negro Act became a model for slave codes throughout the colonies, governing Black lives for more than a century… Northerners also implemented strict curfew laws, which targeted all Black people... Legislation in Connecticut… for example, explicitly encouraged anti-Black vigilantism by authorizing any white person to capture an enslaved person who appeared to be out after nine without specified permission.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “in the northern region of Saint-Domingue, enslaved people painstakingly planned an insurrection—a revolutionary war against their white enslavers… more than one thousand plantations had been burned and hundreds of white people lay dead… White enslavers throughout the world recoiled in shock and horror… Just weeks after the rebellion in Saint-Domingue began… the governor of South Carolina, warned President Washington that similar uprisings would soon spread to the Southern United States and devastate the economy… The emergence of a sovereign Black nation, rising from the ashes of France’s most profitable slave colony, represented the culmination of white people’s deepest fears and Black people’s deepest hopes.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “in the aftermath of the Civil War. White people of all classes and backgrounds feared permanent economic ruin, a disordered social system, and the loss of white privilege… the collapse of the racial order was a bitter pill for poor white people as well… In several states, convict leasing laws allowed the hiring out of people in county prisons to plantation owners and private companies in an unsubtle effort to establish another system of forced labor… Black freedom dreams… were arrested by the late 1870s, as a fierce white backlash against Black freedom succeeded… Fleeing violence… many Black Americans headed north, in what would become known as the Great Migration, to take advantage of the need for industrial workers that arose during the First World War”\nHannah-Jones writes: “ … Today, African Americans and Native Americans share the highest incarceration and poverty rates in the country, as well as the lowest high school graduation numbers. Both groups appear at the bottom of a range of health and well-being indicators... In 1828, Andrew Jackson surged to the presidency on a wave of populist enthusiasm… Jackson’s second State of the Union address, in December 1830, advocated for the expulsion of Native people from their homes, towns, houses of worship, and seats of government. He urged Congress to effect Native “removal” through legislation.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “January 1, 1808 The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves goes into effect, ending the legal trade in enslaved people from outside the United States. But the law does not end slavery... [The] infamous 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case… pitted Scott’s liberty against his enslaver’s property, and when the Supreme Court heard the case, the justices ruled in favor of bondage…[In another case] Lochner appealed… the justices ruled in his favor, finding that extending protections to bakery workers would infringe on the property rights of bakery owners… Today’s law students are taught that Dred Scott and Lochner were wrong.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “Cotton was to the nineteenth century what oil was to the twentieth: one of the most valuable and widely traded commodities in the world.\nAs slave-labor camps spread throughout the South, cotton production surged. By 1831, the country was delivering nearly half the world’s raw cotton crop...”\nHannah-Jones writes: “Could Scott—and, by implication, any Black American—sue as a citizen of the United States?... Taney ruled that Scott had no right to sue because as an enslaved person, he was not a citizen. Taney then went a step further.\nThe nation’s highest court declared that Blackness rendered them unequivocally noncitizens. But the decision was not unanimous… Justice McLean affirmed that all those born in the United States were citizens by birth… Justice Curtis offered “The free native-born citizens of each State are citizens of the United States [and] as free colored persons born within some of the States are citizens of those States, such persons are also citizens of the United States.”… Taney’s conclusion—that Black Americans were not citizens of the United States—went largely unenforced.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “Like a lot of states, Georgia had adopted a Stand Your Ground law, crafted by the National Rifle Association during the 2000s… It also eliminated the previous requirement to retreat from danger if threatened, which was supposed to make lethal violence the last resort, not the first… The Court could have gone back even further than that. The United States has long embraced a legal tradition rooted in seventeenth-century English common law, which established the “castle doctrine”: if one’s home was invaded, the owner had the right to ward off the intruder… Though it did not explicitly say so, the Second Amendment was motivated in large part by a need for the new federal government to assure white people in the South that they would be able to defend themselves against Black people… Henry and his allies were also calling for a Bill of Rights to rein in the power of the federal government and give more authority to the states. They specifically wanted the language about the militia to limit how long state forces would be under national control and to place strict rules on how Congress would use the state militia… Madison decided that he needed to quell the discontent by crafting a Bill of Rights that would mollify the Anti-Federalists and enslavers, yet still leave the national government’s power in place… The Bill of Rights, which focused on the limits of federal power, shut down the phalanx of opposition to the Constitution. The Second Amendment, in particular, which declared, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,” short-circuited Mason’s, Henry’s, and other Southerners’ worries “that the federal government would, in one way or another, render the militia impotent as a slave control device.”… The Second Amendment, ratified in 1791, codified for white citizens the right to bear arms and to protect themselves… Some 179,000 Black men, 10 percent of the Union army, fought in the war.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “After Reconstruction, rejection of racial equality intensified with convict leasing… An 1887 report in Mississippi found that six months after 204 prisoners were leased to a white man… dozens of them were dead or dying… The death rate in some of these prison camps was… 45 percent. As historian… Blackmon’s… book documents, it was Slavery by Another Name… convict leasing… was, as the sociologist David Oshinsky titled his book, Worse Than Slavery.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “Recordings and television broadcasts were putting more Black artists in more white people’s homes… Motown songs had titles like “Do You Love Me” and “I Second That Emotion,” “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” and “I Hear a Symphony.”… But… Motown… was a Black-owned company that made stars of Black people… This wasn’t the first Black-owned recording label. It was, however, the first to assert dominion over white America’s ancient, ambivalent appetite for Blackness… The stars of Motown were the descendants of enslaved laborers, women and men who made music as they toiled.”\nHannah-Jones writes: “[Obama] declared, “The arc of the universe may bend toward justice, but it doesn’t bend on its own.”…Obama was referring to… King, Jr.’ s 1956 speech… : “The arc of the moral universe, although long, is bending toward justice.” … King… paraphrased … “I do not pretend,” Parker wrote, “to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.””",
    "I'm going to do something you normally don't do when writing a review: state my affiliations & biases up front. I am a white male, raised in rural Central New York by conservative middle class parents, who was a registered member of the Republican Party until 2016. I also have a deep love of history, especially that of the United States. While I have never shied away from the darker stories in American history, I have always felt pride at the history of this nation.\n\nI came to the 1619 Project in a backwards way. I started by reading the criticisms of the many people who were negative about it. These included a long list of professors and historians, some of which I have read and respected (e.g. James McPherson). Next I decided it was time to find out what all this commotion was all about, so I read the collection of essays that made up the original 1619 Project. And finally, I ordered this book and read it on arrival.\n\nI think everyone in the US should read this book, and here are my reason why:\n\n#1: The Black story of America needs to be told - I was raised in the northeast with a public school education. In social studies, we talked about slavery, the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement - which was the full extent of what we learned about the impact of Black Americans in our country. The 1619 Project shows there is a much richer story to be told. Yes, some of this history is hard to hear. It’s difficult to admit that many of the Founding Fathers ran forced labor camps, and used violence and fear to maintain order & profits. But how is it we can really understand the people who came before us without knowing the conflict that was core to their being?\n\n#2: Don't believe all the criticism - Much of the criticism of the original 1619 Project focuses on two points: a) that slavery was a driving reason behind Colonists supporting the American Revolution, and b) the statement 1619 instead of 1776 is the founding year in our nation. Nikole Hannah-Jones spends much more time justifying these two comments via historical references in this book. But at the end of the day, these are only two of literally thousands of points she makes - so you can choose to believe it or not and still learn from this work. It is stunning that so much noise has been made about such small points.\n\n#3 - Don't be afraid of the past - The 1619 Project has been tied to Critical Race Theory and claimed as an attempt to erase history and/or make white children feel bad for the past. But this book does not make any attempt to erase history, nor does it make me feel bad. Instead I felt empowered by hearing our history from the perspective of Black Americans. I believe you can be proud of the many accomplishments of George Washington, while still simultaneously confronting his role as a slaveholder. After all the Founding Fathers, like us, were human.\n\n#4 - You cannot criticize what you do not know - If you read some of the reviews, you will see 1 star from people that are not verified as purchasing the book. I assume they read an article or watched a talking head to make their definitive conclusion about this book. Do you really want to be that shallow? I will defend your right to hold this belief… but only if you read it first. I am smarter for gaining a greater understanding of how African Americans have fundamentally shaped our nation, and you will be too.\n\nIn closing I will say this: if HNJ wanted to design an experiment that would prove systemic racism still exists in our society, I’m not sure she could have created a better one than publishing the 1619 Project and watching the reaction to it.",
    "Never mind \"critical race theory\", I was studying this topic as part of my Master's degree back in the early 90's. We called it anti-racism eduction, the goal of which was/is to correct the narrative.\n\nThis book should be on every high school book shelf in North America, particularly in the USA where the revisionist version of white history telling is far too prevalent. Jones has done a great service to all of us with this brilliant piece of work.",
    "My dear Southern neighbour approximately 25 minutes from where I live is a small wooden structure.\nThis structure has been restored and designated by our government as an historical site. It is a church built by slaves who escaped from the curse of slavery in the US. Never forget that it is our, imperfect country, that was the final destination of the \"Under Ground Railway\" Furthermore in the 1830's slavery was abolished in Great Britain and it's colonies of which at the time we were one.",
    "A comprehesive project that has given us the reality of our American history helping us to understand the place of slavery and how it has continued to shape our contemporary life. Again, I am grateful for this comprehensive, well researched, honest presentation of our relationship to slavery and the injustice we have incorporated into our present day.",
    "Viele setzen den Beginn der US-amerikanischen Geschichte auf das Jahr 1776, den Sieg über die Kolonialmächte, die Verfassung. Das 1619-Projekt datiert den Ursprung der USA zurück auf die Ankunft des ersten Schiffes, gefüllt mit afrikanischen Sklav*innen zur Ausbeutung im beginnenden amerikanischen Wirtschaftssystem. Was Nikole Hannah-Jones im NY Times Magazin begann, liegt nun ausgearbeitet als Buch vor. Wie brisant das Projekt ist, zeigt sich auch an den heftigen Gegenreaktionen des konservativen Lagers in den USA, das mit Macht versucht, den Einsatz des 1619-Projekts in Schulen zu unterbinden.",
    "Great book full of lost/hidden historical information. A must read. The author is A+."

    "This story enters the horrifying and terrifying category of books where enjoyment while reading it cannot be applied.\n\n\"We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn’t the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.\"\n\nThe book describes a totalitarian regime where women lost her rights, free will and individualism. They are not allowed to read, write, work, love, own property, have enjoyments, pleasures, or hobbies. All women wear variations of the same outfits, covering the whole body, and are treated as objects for their utility in the society:\n- Red for the Handmaids: fertile women used to produce offspring. They have no names and are considered property of the Commanders they are assigned to\n- Blue for the Wives: higher ranking women on society that are married to the Commanders\n- Green for the Marthas: household servants\n- Brown for the Aunts: responsible for the training of the Handmaids\n\nThe scariest part of the story is that all of these happens in a world that was just like ours in the recent past. All these women use to have normal lives and had to adjust to this new reality where they are men’s property. It feels terrifyingly possible which is scary as hell.\n\nWhat I “liked”:\n- It is well written and feels dreadfully real.\n\nWhat I think it could have been done better:\n- The timeline is intentionally vague but the story only functions if Gilead was implemented in a short time frame. However, most women behaviour on the book would require severe unsatisfaction with her lives and their world, or unimaginable amounts of coercion, brain washing and torture. I think more details would made their apparent state of acceptance over their condition more believable.\n- There’s a lack of details about how Gilead happens. We learn it started with a military coup in which the president and most members of Congress were killed but the remaining details remain quite vague. I wanted to know more, not only to understand how something like this could happen, but also so I could feel more reassured that we are not there (yet?)\n- The bit including the handmaids sharing child labour pains and leaking milk was a complete non-sense.\n\nThis is a very important reading.",
    "I first read The Handmaid's Tale around the time it was published in 1986. I was just 22, a sheltered young thing. I recall wondering what everyone was raving about, since only the top story layer of the book connected for me. Now, with decades of life experience behind me, I see that this is a deeply moving, complex book. I'm so glad I decide to read again just at this moment in time.\n\nYou would think that something written thirty years ago would seem dated. But that wasn't the case for me. If anything, I think there are so many things imagined in the book which have become more possible today instead of less. In a sense, this is a cautionary tale that a large art of the population ignored or misunderstood.\n\nMore than ever, we should be reading this and sharing it with the young women in our lives. And discussing it with them, so they see more of the depth than my 22-year-old self did.\n\nMargaret Atwood imagined a world where a totalitarian power went into action against foreign zealots and their own people's \"wanton\" behavior. This power was meant to make the world better, but it also created a world of highly distinct \"haves\" and \"have nots.\"\n\nShe says, “Better never means better for everyone... It always means worse, for some.” It might be just me (although I suspect not) but this sure sounds like what we often hear today on the news and in conversations.\n\nReading this at the end of 2016 after a brutal election cycle, the following quote from Atwood seems both wise and horrible. Have we not been hearing about people who feel invisible?\n\n“We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories\"\n\nAtwood's Republic of Gilead gives people one-dimensional functions. Correction - she gives women one-dimensional functions. They are Wives, Marthas, Handmaids, Aunts, or Unwomen (and a few more which would be spoilers). Unwomen are rebels, likely to be banished to the toxic waste dumps of the colonies. Everyone else plays a part in the singular female focus - procreation. As I read, I wondered what category I'd fall into should I have the bad luck to land in Gilead. The women there have no layers of life or experience. They are expected only to fulfill their narrow role.\n\nWhy is procreation such a focus? Because of falling birth rates among white people. This book doesn't discuss race except one small spot near the end. It's as if there is only one race in Gilead. And the only people in that race with any power are men.\n\nThe main character, Offred (literally of Fred named after the Commander she serves) is the perfect blend of weak and strong. She tells us of her past and says, “When we think of the past it's the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.” But her life is not beautiful. And Atwood straddles the line of past and present, sending back and forth in a way that keeps you wanting more. Just as Offred wants more. Just as we all want more for ourselves and the generations of women coming after us.\n\nIf you read this book long ago, pick it up again. If you haven't yet read it, move it up to the top of your TBR. Buy it for friends. Buy for your sons and daughters. Use it to teach and to learn what kind of world we could be if we stop valuing the diversity of all people.",
    "What an incredible book. Somewhat unbelievable in some ways, but very much believable as it could happen, in the worst scenario ever (look at what's happening today). It could be reality, it could be women's worst nightmare. I haven't seen the TV programme, only read the original book, so no idea how the writer's have progressed this story for TV. It left a mark on me, it opens your mind as to how women have been treated over time and how we are considered a 'lesser person vs men'. Disturbing book, but very thought provoking. Very.",
    "Not my usual read. But read on the recommendation of a friend . Don’t expect the script of the TV series the book is much much better.Margaret Atwood uses words to spin a tale in which you get entangled. I really didn’t want to put it down, even though I watched it on TV and knew the story. I would and have recommended this book to friends not as a vintage classic but as a must read classic",
    "This book was recommended to me by many women and was listed in several Must-reads for women. I had great expectations and yet this is one of the very few books, which I just couldn't finish no matter how hard I tried. I have never read something more stupid and degrading to women (maybe only comparable to \"50 shades of grey\" in shallowness). Writing style... well with all my respect to the famous Ms Atwood, it is strained and presumptuous, and the narration is slow and boring.",
    "This book is amazing. It has been my favourite novel for fifteen years since I read it for A Level. I'm now an English teacher and every year I buy more copies than I'd like to admit to give to students. It is, in my opinion, the perfect dystopian novel: fiction that's just close enough to reality to scare the living daylights out of you.",
    "Ive never read a book like this before. And I've read many hundreds in my life. This was on a blog titled: '25 books every woman needs to read in her life' and it came in at number one. I'm so glad I bought it because I couldn't put it down\n\nIf I had to use one word to describe this book it would be \"terrifying\". I simply loved it!"

    "It would be helpful if everything was printed on cards and we didn’t have to read website too.",
    "The system creates an awesome language for my fiancé and I to talk about household things. Book is mildly sexist, wish she actually used a mix of pronouns and examples instead of a throwaway “you can use any gender in these examples” at the beginning.",
    "So great!! Great conversations and keeps you honest😍",
    "My husband and I have been using the Fair Play system, based on reading the book Fair Play, for about eight months now. Although the book isn't perfect, the system is working for us and we adapt it to fit our lives. When I first finished reading the book, like many people I asked, \"Where are the cards?\" Then I realized the game is a metaphor and you can use whatever system you like. We have been using a Trello board with digital cards. So when this physical deck was released, I thought it would be a waste of money and a hard pass. Then I decided to give it a try, because these are hard discussions and any tool that makes it easier might just be worth it. It turns out I like the cards!\n\nOur biggest struggle with Fair Play is the looooong conversations. There are a lot of cards, and a lot to figure out together. Even with a pared down deck and relatively low housekeeping standards. I don't send Christmas cards, lol. The book doesn't give a lot of examples about how a Fair Play meeting might go. It all looks easy, but as you begin to have these meetings you can really get lost in the weeds. I found that this deck of cards encouraged us to be quick about it. Instead of yakking at length, we quickly flipped through the cards and grabbed the ones we needed to. Having a physical deck puts the emphasis on simply *taking* the card. Sure, we need to have conversations about standards too, and the fact that we've been using this system helped move things along. But I found the cards sped things up, made it easy to visualize the act of \"taking on\" a responsibility, and even made it easy to quickly trade and do the exercise of considering what our spouse was holding.\n\nI am taking off one star because the cards should include some more definition about what goes into each task. While these can be found on the website and in the book, if you're paying for a printed deck, some version of it should be on the card in your hands. A lot of space is wasted by having the back of each card look (mostly) identical, like traditional playing cards. Put some CPE info there instead.",
    "Making a game of tedious tasks is always a good strategy. This deck has it's pros and cons, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. It's a great way to start a conversation about the distribution of work in a household. Communication is key, and no one wants to feel criticized or as if they're not contributing enough. It's so easy to feel like a failure when simple chores are left unfinished because no one takes up the task in a timely manner, leaving an issue area like a few dishes or dust bunnies to grow into an overwhelming task. With these cards divided up, there's no question about who is doing what and when. It suddenly becomes clear just how much each person is taking on, and if anything, helps everyone appreciate the mutual effort of keeping things running smoothly.\n\nIt's still often the case that the \"mental load\" of a household falls on women. As an article from Forbes on this very subject puts it: \"It’s having to remember to pick up eggs. Even if you ask someone else to buy eggs, it’s you then checking that the eggs were in fact bought. It’s essentially project management. And when it’s at work, that’s what we call it. Project management. Or just management. It’s a whole job. Yet when it’s at home, we call it, well, we don’t really have a word for it.\" The micro-tasks that stack up throughout any given day shouldn't fall to one person or one gender in a household, and this deck attempts to even that playing field.\n\nPros:\n★Conversation starter (positive communication is key)\n★Making a game of tedious tasks is always a good strategy\n★Assist in the even distribution of household work and \"mental load\"\n★Make clear who is doing what and when in a household\n★Foster appreciation between members of a household\n\nCons:\n★More couple-centric versus family-centric or household-centric\n★Many cards (almost half of the deck) for child rearing (these can just be pulled from the deck and kept in the box for childless households). Maybe a future installment of these cards could be further divided, so the child rearing cards can actually be expanded upon and purchased separately. This would make the set more approachable for different households and living arrangements, other than a nuclear family.\n★★★★★",
    "When i started using the deck i realised how many things are missing from it and stikl had to make lists and thibk of everyhring myself. The colours arw very boring. Therefore i am returning it.",
    "the idea for this gamified version of allotting responsibilities is excellent. BUT\nif you hold a crad be it for the week or generally: YOU CANNOT SHARE the task and:\n\ncleaning is 1 !!!!!!!!! card (this is my biggest beef. every day household chores are one thing but cleaning needs to be separated into a LIST OF CLEANING TASKS (if this was done well it could be been the most useful thing in recent history for domestic piece, ppl would be able to discuss their \"standard of care for EACH item that needs cleaning individually when they move in together, instead it is a GROSS distortion - again (the very thing this game was supposed to aid in changing) of the burden of cleaning. washing the car once a month is not comparable to having to do the dishes every single meal AND THEN having to clean the dish washer, the sink, the sponges and putting them away.. and those are merely 2 of the myriad of things that are \"cleaning\". They didn't even go with daily maintenance cleaning and deep cleaning (which depending on what your needs are can be anywhere from monthly to biannually)\n\ngainful employment regardless of hours is NO CARD!!!!!\nand\nimho the biggest disgrace is that parents and PARENT IN LAW relations is also ONE!!!!!! card, meaning that it is communicated not as a task each partner individually should embark on with their parents and that the in law may have a very different yet also deeply PERSONAL relationship with THEIR parents in law, \"parents\" are an individual \"obligation\" that is not SHARED among couples UNLESS for very specific and negotiated reasons this is different.\n\nSo, yeah, Hubs and I mostly had a very enjoyable conversation about our tasks and about how BAD we found the execution of this game, they didn\nT even give you a handful of empty card to personalize. which is - given both the hype AND the excellent production quality and EASY out they could have used.\n'\nI know there is a book to go with this. but it is marketed separately. I would in fact suggest that couples take the idea and run with it: both parts of any given couple. get yourself a set of filing cards the small ones are probably sufficient. then over the course of a month low key record the tasks that you do and that you feel need to be done then convene with those cards and discuss the time and mental burden of each, if you are all happy with the current standard of care try to then break down the burden level on each individual (some ppl HATE dishes others find it soothing) and time required at a competent level (I may take 20 mins to prep dinner you might take an hour) then realistically look at the time you both have at hand. then prioritize your tasks. and look at what NEEDS to be done - non negotiable - and what can be realistically done in addition between the two of you, navigating your own sense of comfort. plan in time for yourselves as a couple and as individually. KNOW that joy is not optional! and reserve time for that if at ALL possible. and then allot the tasks individually, either weekly, or monthly or completely. make sure to convene in time intervally that are AT THE VERY LEAST ANNUAL (I find monthly a very good time frame, especially if things are tight timewise)\n\nMost of all be kind to each other and don't use it as a possibility to screw each other over.. note that if you are THERE, it may be time to look for another person to play with. AVOID seeing this as 1 partner assigns tasks (like a mom would a chore) but make sure you BOTH see this as a thing you do together.",
    "I thought this was gonna be a fun and helpful thing to do with my husband, but about 5 cards in, we realised this game doesn't apply to us! Not to brag, but we already communicate well, share chores well and help each other lighten each other's loads. I could see this being great for people with kids and busier lives but I'm returning it.",
    "These cards are big. I wouldn’t mind them being big if they had the explanations on them but they don’t. We still have to refer back to the website to clarify what each card means. Having them big is inconvenient to display so we didn’t find them helpful in using them to keep track of who holds what cards.\nI read the book and love the system! These cards are definitely less valuable without the book and even the website.",
    "We have been at our wits end in the marriage. We thought this deck wld help.. as a young mum, there are so many other things that are missing, no mention of the mental load and the little things. Using the cards made us go in the opposite direction as I had hoped.."

    "One of my readers recommended this book, and I enjoyed it a lot. Given its massive success, I am not going to write very much about its content (here's an overview) but give some comments and impressions on Hariri's thinking.\n\nWarning: I made over 300 notes, as Hariri is an elegant and perceptive thinker and writer. Below, I group my comments or quote Hariri by the book's parts.\n\nAlthough many points are presented as fact, I think of them as informed opinion. In most cases, I agree with Harari's logic, but that agreement dropped as his narrative approached our contemporary times (skip to the bottom). I think that's less due to the presence of more data than the ever-deepening diversity and complexity of our institutions -- trends that Hariri also acknowledges.\n\nPart 1: The cognitive revolution\nHumans are born underdeveloped, so they need help growing up. Thus we have strong social potential that can be shaped (language, taste, religion) in many ways.\nOur jump to the top of the food chain (due to the advantages of social organization) was sudden. Thus, we lack natural predators or instincts that might limit our exploitation of resources, a problem that's especially acute in the \"new world\"\nHumans are \"afraid\" in the sense that they do not understand their power. Thus, we might over-react against perceived threats or destroy through ignorance: \"The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the most important and most destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced\" [p 62].\nLanguage probably (?) allowed sapiens to dominate and eliminate Neanderthals (and other human species) even though any given Neanderthal individual was stronger and smarter. Language and social organization made it easier for groups of sapiens to dominate Neanderthals via collective action. Aside: Read this fascinating paper on how groups facing extinction (i.e., competition from other groups) will cooperate at much higher levels than groups not facing existential threats. And here's a great description of why sapiens are tribal and how to overcome tribalism in the name of nation, tolerance, etc.\nLanguage allowed abstract thought, planning, story telling and deeper social relations, all of which drove forward the cognitive revolution and dominance of our species.\nGossip made it easier to control bad behavior. The value of a \"maximum anthropological unit\" is based on the fact that \"most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings\" [p 26].\nReligion grew out of story telling. Religion, fiction and other communal myths help larger groups cooperate by supporting laws, money, and other institutions.\nTelling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals.\nStory-telling allows cultural evolution to run 1,000x faster than genetic evolution.\nOur diverse stories led to \"culture\" and the events changing culture became \"history.\"\nThese stories make it possible for sapiens to cooperate in far larger groups than our chimpanzee cousins that are limited to groups of 150.\nPart 2: The agricultural revolution\nThe majority of individuals were far worse off living with domesticated animals and crops. They had worse nutrition, worked harder, suffered from more disease (a key element in Guns Germs and Steel), and lost autonomy to elites who could control property: \"This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution\" [p. 97].\nThe agricultural revolution led to larger populations that needed high-density food production systems to survive. Thus, we lost the \"exit option\" to return to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. (It's also true that agricultural societies could seize land and territory from hunter-gathers, so all groups were trapped in that equilibrium.) The same \"no-return\" problem (cf. Logic of Collective Action) makes it hard to reverse an arm-race, educational inflation, imported-water-dependent cities and farms. Likewise, the \"luxury trap\" has turned email into an incessant job, our \"smart\" phones into pestering devices.\nThe agricultural revolution led to required planning, which introduced stress about potential futures that hunter-gathers had never needed to experience. Planning led to bureaucracy, elites and rulers, who have taxed peasant workers (us!) ever since. Those elites funded art, temples, palaces and forts, but those \"cultural institutions\" were not often available to peasants.\nPage 101: \"History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets...\" for rulers who often started wars fueled by peasant blood.\nPage 111: \"If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse? Voltaire said about God that ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night’.\"\nPage 112: \"To say that a social order is maintained by military force immediately raises the question: what maintains the military order? It is impossible to organise an army solely by coercion. At least some of the commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something, be it God, honour, motherland, manhood or money... How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You always insist that the order sustaining society is an objective reality created by the great gods or by the laws of nature. People are unequal, not because Hammurabi said so, but because Enlil and Marduk decreed it. People are equal, not because Thomas Jefferson said so, but because God created them that way. Free markets are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so, but because these are the immutable laws of nature.\"\nThese beliefs underpin individualism, romantic vacations, consumerism, pick-up basketball, etc.\nPage 118: \"These imagined orders are inter-subjective, so in order to change them we must simultaneously change the consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy. A change of such magnitude can be accomplished only with the help of a complex organisation, such as a political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult.\"\nSocial orders work on a small scale due to evolved social skills (gossip). On a larger scale, they depend on writing and numbers -- abstractions that are harder for sapiens to grasp and use. Both can be helpful in communicating information across time to many people, but both are abused. Writing can be abused via dubious logic (Marx's labor theory of value). Numbers are abused in their abstraction. Many scams depend on \"trustworthy people\" selling us crap at prices that do not result in value. Think multi-level marketing, Brexit's “£350 million a week,” or Trump's steel policy (\"create 33,000 metal-making jobs and destroy 179,000 metal-dependent ones\")\nPage 136-8: \"Time and again people have created order in their societies by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as superiors, commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and plebeians; Brahmins and Shudras; or rich and poor. These categories have regulated relations between millions of humans by making some people legally, politically or socially superior to others. Hierarchies serve an important function... In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.\"\nPage 142-3: \"The stigma that labelled blacks as, by nature, unreliable, lazy and less intelligent conspired against him. You might think that people would gradually understand that these stigmas were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over time, to prove themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as whites. In fact, the opposite happened – these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time went by. Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe that blacks really are inferior...Such vicious circles can go on for centuries and even millennia, perpetuating an imagined hierarchy that sprang from a chance historical occurrence. Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. Money comes to money, and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education, and ignorance to ignorance. Those once victimised by history are likely to be victimised yet again.\"\nPage 145: \"Rape, in many legal systems, falls under property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was raped but the male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the transfer of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property.\"\nPage 147: \"From a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other. In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’.\"\nPage 155: \"It is only natural that the chain of power within the species will also be determined by mental and social abilities more than by brute force. It is therefore hard to believe that the most influential and most stable social hierarchy in history is founded on men’s ability physically to coerce women...the greater the number of wars, the greater men’s control of society. This feedback loop explains both the ubiquity of war and the ubiquity of patriarchy.\"\nMen are in power mostly because they are pushier, not because they are better at ruling.\nPage 160: \"During the last century gender roles have undergone a tremendous revolution. More and more societies today not only give men and women equal legal status, political rights and economic opportunities, but also completely rethink their most basic conceptions of gender and sexuality\" ... and the results can be seen in many cultures and countries: not just better lives for women but better lives for men.\nPart 3: The unification of humankind\nPage 163-4: \"Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called ‘culture’... every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change.\"\nPage 166&172: \"Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations...the first universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. Merchants, conquerors and prophets were the first people who managed to transcend the binary evolutionary division, ‘us vs them’, and to foresee the potential unity of humankind.\"\nPage 177: \"Money is not coins and banknotes. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of different commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently.\"\nPage 183: \"Counterfeiting is not just cheating – it’s a breach of sovereignty, an act of subversion against the power, privileges and person of the king. The legal term is lese-majesty (violating majesty), and was typically punished by torture and death. As long as people trusted the power and integrity of the king, they trusted his coins.\"\nGood news! \"For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively\" [p 186].\nBad news! \"When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand. Human communities and families have always been based on belief in ‘priceless’ things, such as honour, loyalty, morality and love. These things lie outside the domain of the market, and they shouldn’t be bought or sold for money. Even if the market offers a good price, certain things just aren’t done. Parents mustn’t sell their children into slavery; a devout Christian must not commit a mortal sin; a loyal knight must never betray his lord; and ancestral tribal lands shall never be sold to foreigners. Money has always tried to break through these barriers, like water seeping through cracks in a dam\" [p 186].\nPage 187: \"As money brings down the dams of community, religion and state, the world is in danger of becoming one big and rather heartless marketplace. Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will corrupt human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly destroy the communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce for so long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society, religion and the environment from enslavement to market forces. It is common nowadays to believe that the market always prevails, and that the dams erected by kings, priests and communities cannot long hold back the tides of money. This is naïve.\"\nPage 190: \"Cultural diversity and territorial flexibility give empires not only their unique character, but also their central role in history. It’s thanks to these two characteristics that empires have managed to unite diverse ethnic groups and ecological zones under a single political umbrella, thereby fusing together larger and larger segments of the human species and of planet Earth.\"\nPage 195-6: \"Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over Jews – he was also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare. The presumption to rule the entire world for the benefit of all its inhabitants was startling. Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‘we’ and ‘they’ ... [in contrast] imperial ideology from Cyrus onward has tended to be inclusive and all-encompassing. Even though it has often emphasised racial and cultural differences between rulers and ruled, it has still recognised the basic unity of the entire world.\"\nPage 197: \"Ideas, people, goods and technology spread more easily within the borders of an empire than in a politically fragmented region. Often enough, it was the empires themselves which deliberately spread ideas, institutions, customs and norms. One reason was to make life easier for themselves. It is difficult to rule an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of writing, its own language and its own money. Standardisation was a boon to emperors\" -- but not always to individuals.\nPage 204: \"Many Indians adopted, with the zest of converts, Western ideas such as self-determination and human rights, and were dismayed when the British refused to live up to their own declared values by granting native Indians either equal rights as British subjects or independence. Nevertheless, the modern Indian state is a child of the British Empire,\" which is a problem when it comes to its centralizing tendency -- a tendency present in many post-colonial countries -- to deny local autonomy and ignore local solutions.\nPage 210: \"Religion must... espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere [and] insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary... People tend to believe that all religions are like them. In fact, the majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive... As far as we know, universal and missionary religions began to appear only in the first millennium BC. Their emergence was one of the most important revolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the unification of humankind, much like the emergence of universal empires and universal money.\"\nPage 214: \"Most Hindus... are sunk deep in the morass of mundane concerns, where Atman [the supreme being] is not much help. For assistance in such matters, Hindus approach the gods with their partial powers. Precisely because their powers are partial rather than all-encompassing, gods such as Ganesha, Lakshmi and Saraswati have interests and biases. Humans can therefore make deals with these partial powers and rely on their help in order to win wars and recuperate from illness.\"\nPage 215-18: \"The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and evangelising god of the Christians. The Roman Empire did not require the Christians to give up their beliefs and rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect to the empire’s protector gods and to the divinity of the emperor. This was seen as a declaration of political loyalty. When the Christians vehemently refused to do... polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians. In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion... Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition.\"\nThat said, \"The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults differed little from those of the polytheistic gods\" [p 219].\nPage 227: \"Buddhism does not deny the existence of gods – they are described as powerful beings who can bring rains and victories – but they have no influence on the law that suffering arises from craving. If the mind of a person is free of all craving, no god can make him miserable. Conversely, once craving arises in a person’s mind, all the gods in the universe cannot save him from suffering.\"\nPage 232-4: \"The main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from degeneration and encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the Nazis said that the Aryan race, the most advanced form of humanity, had to be protected and fostered, while degenerate kinds of Homo sapiens like Jews, Roma, homosexuals and the mentally ill had to be quarantined and even exterminated... Hitler dug not just his own grave but that of racism in general. When he launched World War Two, he compelled his enemies to make clear distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Afterwards, precisely because Nazi ideology was so racist, racism became discredited in the West. But the change took time. White supremacy remained a mainstream ideology in American politics at least until the 1960s.\"\nPage 241-3: \"So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine...There is no basis for thinking that the most successful cultures in history are necessarily the best ones for Homo sapiens. Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of individual organisms. And individual humans, for their part, are usually far too ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage.\"\nPart 4: The scientific revolution\nPage 251-3: \"The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions. Premodern traditions of knowledge such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world was already known...The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely expanded our capacity to understand how the world works and our ability to invent new technologies. But it presents us with a serious problem that most of our ancestors did not have to cope with. Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. If the evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together? How can our communities, countries and international system function?\"\nGood news! \"The notion that humankind could [end wars, famine or death] by discovering new knowledge and inventing new tools was worse than ludicrous – it was hubris. The story of the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, the story of the Golem and countless other myths taught people that any attempt to go beyond human limitations would inevitably lead to disappointment and disaster\" [p 264].\nBad news! Scientific advancement was not going to \"overcome any and every problem by acquiring and applying new knowledge... because it would be funded and directed for the benefit of rulers and empire, not humanity.\nPage 282: \"What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it [rather than the Asian empires generating 80 percent of the world's wealth] to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism. Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages.\"\nSuperior knowledge made it possible for a ridiculously small number of Britons to control India.\nPage 303: \"the place of racism in imperial ideology has now been replaced by ‘culturism’...

That’s why many cultures concluded that making bundles of money was sinful...If the pie is static, and I have a big part of it, then I must have taken somebody else’s slice...

Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political perspective.\"\nHarari claims [p 215] that the human economy has been able to grow continuously \"thanks only\" to scientific discoveries but forgets how fossil fuels have allowed us to consume \"millions of years of solar energy\" in only a few centuries.\nPage 318: \"The secret of Dutch success was credit. The Dutch burghers, who had little taste for combat on land, hired mercenary armies to fight the Spanish for them. The Dutch themselves meanwhile took to the sea in ever-larger fleets. Mercenary armies and cannon-brandishing fleets cost a fortune, but the Dutch were able to finance their military expeditions more easily than the mighty Spanish Empire because they secured the trust of the burgeoning European financial system at a time when the Spanish king was carelessly eroding its trust in him. Financiers extended the Dutch enough credit to set up armies and fleets, and these armies and fleets gave the Dutch control of world trade routes, which in turn yielded handsome profits. The profits allowed the Dutch to repay the loans, which strengthened the trust of the financiers.\"\nFrom around here (1800) forward, Harari's narrative is (more) vulnerable to critique, probably due to a combination of his over-reliance on a given trend that might ignore other trends or an over-simplified version of a concept (capitalism, for example).\n\nHe says [p 329] \"there simply is no such thing as a market free of all political bias,\" but that's obvious when you remember that political institutions (e.g., property rights or regulation) determine the form and regulate the operation of the market.\n\nThe sad thing is that he -- by underestimating the importance of institutions -- lays too much credit/blame on the economy, i.e., \"much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.\" This claim might be justified by looking at the number of people living below the \"$1.90 per day line\" (11 percent, or 800 million), but \"hunger\" is often the outcome of failed political structures (politicians favoring themselves over their citizens [pdf]), and \"want\" should be blamed on our desires (see Buddha, above) rather than the \"new ethic of consumerism\" that \"appears\" as a means of rescuing capitalists from their overproduction [p 347].\n\nThis claim -- besides appearing in the passive tense, as if handed down by god -- is naive.\n\nI see many of these market developments as good and many of the problems of inequality as the result of political decisions, but perhaps he's upset at \"the collapse of the family and the local community and their replacement by the state and the market\" [p 355] because he prefers the pre-market world where \"the community offered help on the basis of local traditions and an economy of favours, which often differed greatly from the supply and demand laws of the free market\" [p 356]. That nostalgia in the present day might echo his ancestor's nostalgia for the the life of a hunter gatherer after the agricultural revolution, but I do not agree on the parallel.\n\nFirst, it's unlikely that a community-oriented society will be invaded and colonized by a capitalist-oriented society in the same way that hunter-gathers were displaced by farmers.\n\nSecond, it's much easier for anyone to \"go back\" to a community lifestyle and spend less time in the market economy. We have the technology and productivity to make it possible for someone to work less and enjoy a decent standard of living. (After-tax wages in the Netherlands are probably half the level of those in the US, but the quality of life is better here for most people -- due to communal and market reasons.)\n\nThird, Harari assumes that people are hapless victims -- \"many of us now bewail the loss of strong families and communities and feel alienated and threatened by the power the impersonal state and market wield over our lives\" [p 360] -- assertions of dependency that I would not make for most people in middle and upper-income countries. (Neither would Mr Money Mustache.) Are the poor people in the world with limited agency? Absolutely. But many other people are more trapped by their decisions (college debt, opioids, pregnancies) than \"the impersonal state and market.\" (That said, I'll allow for the power of marketing propaganda.)\n\nFourth, Harari seems to have a nostalgia for an imagined paradise: \"The intimate communities fulfilled the emotional needs of their members and were essential for everyone’s survival and welfare. In the last two centuries, the intimate communities have withered, leaving imagined communities to fill in the emotional vacuum\" [p 362]. In my experience of the recent history of ex-communisst countries, there was indeed a loss of community when people gained the freedom to earn more and buy goods and services they had previously traded with friends, but v",
    "Review of Harari’s \"Sapiens\" by Paul F. Ross\n\nHarari invests this work in speculations about how ideas shape the course of human history. If you enjoy the imagination of the novelist, if you enjoy a romp in the sandbox of ideas, if you seek the speculations of the philosopher, you may enjoy this pretend review of the history of humankind. Harari borrows the timeline of the universe at 13.5 billion years, humans having been around for 2 million years, ____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHarari, Yuval Noah Sapiens: A brief history of humankind 2015, HarperCollins Publishers, New York NY, x + 445 pages\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nand spends over half his pages reviewing the most recent 3,000 years, one quarter of one millionth of the universe’s life. Thomas Jefferson, in helping author the US Declaration of Independence, says the Creator gave the “unalienable rights” of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” to all human beings. Harari sees happiness as controlled by expectations with an individual’s expectations changing constantly based on the individual’s successes and failures. Harari sees humans as living in a world of ideas which have no substance, no physical reality, and therefore no real existence. Harari characterizes Nazism, communism, liberalism, socialism, feminism, and capitalism as religions alongside Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Manichaeanism, Judaism, Confucianism, and Stoicism. Harari’s “history” is a grand ride through idea-land.\n\nHistory shares something with science and something with story-telling. History says “Show me the evidence, then I’ll find a way to make the evidence hang together, the credibility of the ‘hanging together’ with learned audiences being the only criterion needing satisfaction.” Science says “Show me the evidence, then I’ll search for an explanation which works in multiple situations, perhaps everywhere, and can be reproduced by any observer following the original methods.” Harari takes his history of the universe from the knowledge base developed by the sciences and hangs upon that sequence “ideas” which seem to him to have been key in guiding events. Harari’s history is all about the shaping and reshaping of ideas.\n\nHarari’s timeline reads … 13.5 billion years ago matter and energy are created (in the Big Bang), 6 million years ago chimpanzees and humans shared their last common grandmother, 2 million years ago humans spread from Africa to Eurasia, 200,000 thousand years ago homo sapiens (distinguished by a large brain) evolved in East Africa, 30,000 years ago the Neanderthals went extinct (perhaps because they were\nout-competed by their cousins, homo sapiens), 16,000 years ago homo sapiens found its way to the Americas, 12,000 years ago homo sapiens converted from being a hunter-gatherer to being an agriculturist, 5,000 years ago kingdoms and money had been invented, 2,500 years ago coinage was invented, 2,000 years ago Christianity came into being, 1,400 years ago Islam came into being, 500 years ago the industrial revolution began affecting what humans produce, 200 years ago the scientific revolution began affecting what humans produce.\n\nScientists, in their own way, share Harari’s approach. Scientists trace facts and try to explain them. For example, Pinker describes The better angels of our nature (2011). Pinker shows that today’s human tendency to kill each other – the killing-rate per 100,000 people per year, one aspect of human behavior – is lower than at any previous time in history. That statement is evidence-based. Pinker, using methods like those of Harari, then searches for the steps humans made in arriving at today’s low rate of killing. Piketty in Capital in the twenty-first century (2014) and Milanovic in Global inequality (2016) explore what drives and what impedes the spread between the wealth of the least-wealthy fifty percent and the wealth of the most-wealthy one percent. They describe the evidence. Then they search for explanations. Piketty has one explanation. Milanovic has several. Pinker, Piketty, and Milanovic, each are science-like in reporting data and historian-like in searching for explanations. Much science is even more rigorous than Pinker, Piketty, and Milanovic, forming an explanation based on having examined data, then testing whether that explanation holds up in a new batch of data. Harari, historian, writes Sapiens (2015) with a much looser approach to explaining the direction of history than scientists.\n\nThinking as a scientist thinks, this reader sees Harari’s primary “findings” as rubbish. Harari’s explanations for the new directions in history merit the evaluation “rubbish” for five reasons …\n\n… (1) Science forms an hypothesis and then tests it by gathering data. It uses two methods. It forms an hypothesis, then gathers data to see if the hypothesis holds up when the data are examined. Or science gathers data, does analysis, forms an hypothesis, then gathers a second sample of data to see if the hypothesis holds up in the second sample. Repeated, similar observations reinforce scientists’ confidence in the observed relationships. History also gathers data, but it has no requirement that the data gathered can be justified as “representative” of experience for a designated population of people. History then forms an explanation for why the data are as they are. The test for the correctness of that explanation is that fellow humans accept the explanation. In science, many hypotheses fail the scientist’s test. Surely “taking thought” by historians, thus forming explanations, is just as vulnerable to forming false explanations as is the hypothesis-formation of scientists. Harari’s history may entertain, but is as subject to being wrong as is framing hypotheses in science. Science discovers its errors by a test. History has no such test.\n\n… (2) Science asks scientists to cite the sources of their data and their ideas. If the hypothesis being tested today was formulated by someone other than the author, the scientist is expected to cite its source. Harari turns to recently published work by scientists – anthropologists, archaeologists, evolutionary psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and the like – and, using their data, presents ideas explaining the data without naming the author of the explanation. An unsophisticated reader will assume that all the explanations are Harari’s ideas. This reader doubts that Harari is the originator of all the explanations he presents. Harari seems to violate the “due credit to others” which is a value guiding scientific work and also, I suspect, guiding the work of historians.\n\n… (3) The behavioral sciences recognize “culture” as a mélange of knowledge and practices passed from generation to generation by way of education. The behavioral sciences develop ways to measure aspects of culture and individuality. A behavioral scientist acknowledges “consideration” as an aspect of behavior guiding social interaction that varies from individual to individual, culture to culture. The behavioral scientist develops questionnaires to win self-reports or observer-reports about consideration. The same can be said for many aspects of culture and individuality … egalitarianism, initiative, risk taking, happiness, sadism, religiosity, conscientiousness, populism, and so on. Harari understands how happiness is measured using a questionnaire but shows no indication that he understands measurements of many other aspects of personality and culture can be captured by these methods, understands their reproducibility, understands the waxing and waning of the measured characteristics. Harari almost seems to believe that if an idea has no weight (in grams), cannot be seen with a microscope or telescope, cannot be judged for its age by the decay of the C14 isotope, the idea has no meaning. Ignorance of the behavioral sciences and their measurements at this level cannot be tolerated in someone who seeks to lead thought.\n\n… (4) Harari sees animals’ fear of humans as an instinct developed through evolution. He seems not to understand that ideas can be developed by sapiens and passed to their offspring by education. The same seems to be likely for more than a few animal species … chimpanzees, elephants, … Harari seems to allow a change in genetics as the only means for changing an organism’s behavior. Ignorance of the importance of education in modifying behavior – the capability for an individual to learn – cannot be tolerated in someone who seeks to lead thought. Harari needs to have taken an introductory course in psychology and learned that Pavlov’s dogs, after a while, salivated when they heard a bell. There was nothing genetic, nothing evolutionary, in that response to a bell by Pavlov’s dogs. People, too, change behavior based on experience. Psychologists and educators call it learning. People even pass along what they have learned to the next generation. The process is called education.\n\n… (5) Harari seems to revel in the ill that a transition in the human story introduces. The change from hunter-gatherer to agriculturist brought increased food supplies, population growth, formation of villages and cities, a place to live called home, the opportunity to accumulate property. Harari seems to focus on the increased liability of crops to disease and crop failure, the increased work in weeding a crop-producing field, the decline in variety in diet from many foods to a few, the increased burden of channeling water to the field, the increased risk of communicable disease and its devastation in villages and cities, the development of families with wealth and power, the development of government and accompanying loss of individual freedom. By contrast, Pinker (2011) sees the same transition, from hunter-gatherer to agriculturist, as one in which a cooperating populace was understood to have gained collective wealth and power, that killing each other reduces that wealth and power, and that killing each other needs to be suppressed as a practice through the influence of government. Pinker documented his hypothesis with statistics about death from severe trauma gathered from gravesites … hunter-gatherers’ gravesites and agriculturists’ gravesites. We do not need to accept Harari’s downbeat view of human social development as the major social direction. This reader prefers that his scientist-historian have clear glasses, neither dark-tinged nor rose-colored.\n\nPublishers cover a book’s dust cover’s backside with testimonials from well-known people who find value in the author’s and publisher’s product. HarperCollins quotes pre-publication reviews of Harari’s book. On the front of the dust cover, above the author’s name and book’s title, HarperCollins quotes Jared Diamond, the author of Guns, germs, and steel (1997) in which Diamond sought to understand how societies emerge and disappear. Diamond says “Sapiens tackles the biggest questions of history and of the modern world, and it is written in unforgettably vivid language.” Harari tackles questions like when and why did governance begin and when and why did people begin to cooperate in waging war? The quote from Diamond omits saying whether Diamond thinks Harari makes any useful progress in answering these questions! This reader thinks that omission is a telling, damning omission.\n\nHarari’s method for deciphering why cultures advance, and science’s method for gaining insight into why cultures advance, are brought into sharp contrast by a story from science. Having followed history’s timeline to about 1600 CE, Harari then asks “What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world?” Harari answers his own question by adding “There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism (p 282).” Harari contrasts the small population and equally small Gross Domestic Product of Europe in 1600 CE with the large populations and large GDPs of China and India of that time. Then Harari tells stories of advances in science and exploration initiated in Europe (Chapter 15) and triumphs of the capitalist creed in Europe (Chapter 16). Working cheek by jowl, according to Harari, science and capitalism powered Europe and America to world leadership in ideas and productivity by 2000 CE.\n\nBut Harari is wrong. It is not an advance in knowledge yoked with the motivation to pursue profits that produce changes in organizational behavior and improvement in productivity. Organizations (governments, peoples) adopt innovative new practices only when new ideas flow into the organization and when, at the same time, the organization finds the means (push, courage, supporters of experimentation) to support trials of the new methods (Ross, 1974). “Initiating” and “sustaining” mechanisms have nothing to do with effort spent at R&D (science) nor are they yoked to capitalism’s search for profits or market dominance. In the late 1960s, Ross (that’s me) and his colleagues at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were asked by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to investigate how school districts could be encouraged to adopt new methods, becoming more effective in their educational missions. We began by studying the experts’ views of that time. The experts said it was necessary to have a “change agent” in the organization, someone who saw the opportunity and built interest in the new practice. We selected for study an innovation holding attention in education at that time … team teaching. We located a few school districts across the nation that had just adopted team teaching. We asked the school superintendents if we could visit those districts and interview teachers, parents, administrators, and school board members about their use of team teaching and how the district came to adopt the new practice. We gained permission. We made our first visit to a school district in South Carolina. We did our interviews and made our notes over the course of two or three days, then returned to our offices. It was blatantly clear that the widely popular “change agent” theory for how change occurs did not explain what happened in this district. I sat at my desk in puzzlement, then – stimulated by what we had learned in South Carolina – generated a new theory. My theory said “The new idea has to come from somewhere, typically from outside the organization, and find its way into the school district.” That could happen several different ways. I called those processes for importing new ideas “initiating mechanisms.” My theory also said “There must be support within the district for trying the new idea.” Support, too, could materialize in several different ways. I called those processes “sustaining mechanisms.” My theory said “The new practice will remain in place, or be abandoned, depending on the results that it produces.” I called the processes for measuring results and sharing that information “feedback mechanisms.” My theory said that nothing happens unless both initiating mechanisms and sustaining mechanisms are present. Weakness in either mechanism means no innovation, no change in practice, occurs. Notice that there’s not a word in this theory about “having science present,” “investing in R&D,” “earning profits,” “earning fame,” “winning a competition.” I clearly was not using Harari’s notion that when “science” and “capitalism” are side by side, organizations adopt new practices. I developed questionnaires asking the interviewers who had traveled to South Carolina about the “initiating mechanisms” and the “sustaining mechanisms” that they may have learned about in their interviews. I prepared a questionnaire which asked the interviewer to describe the degree to which the “team teaching” we had observed in that district conformed to the best practices for a teaching team leading a classroom. The interviewers who had gone to South Carolina completed my questionnaires. Then we identified teams of interviewers who went on to six or eight other school districts across the nation … one district in Tennessee, Illinois, California, and so on. The interviewers in South Carolina did some of the other site visits. Additional interviewers were trained and did interviews in still other school districts. We completed visits and questionnaire answering. We assembled the scores for each district with respect to “initiating mechanisms (I),” “sustaining mechanisms (S),” and “accomplishments in following best practices in doing team teaching (A).” I wrote an equation describing my theory. The measure of “I” (developed from the questionnaires of several interviewers) multiplied by the measure of “S” (also developed from questionnaires answered by several interviewers) produced a predictor of accomplishment in team teaching. Measures for each district were developed by combining the results from questionnaires from all interviewers in the district. We correlated the “I x S” score for each district with the “A” score for the district. The correlation was r ~ 0.9 … statistically different from zero even with our tiny sample of school districts … and surprisingly large. Our theory, not the theory that a “change agent” is key, was supported by our findings. Funds for our study did not provide follow up with the school districts to see how long the new team teaching practices remained in place and whether other parts of the school district, or other school districts, adopted the new practices, so we learned nothing about the third leg of the theory … whether feedback mechanisms determined how long the new practice remains in place and/or is adopted elsewhere.\n\nEven with our small study, science had given its answer to the question “What leads organizations to adopt new practices?” Organizations adopt new practices (a) when a relevant idea arrives from somewhere (the idea for most innovations originates off site) and (b) when there is support from somewhere within or outside the organization (teachers, administrators, parents, school board members, state education leaders, incentives offered by the federal government, etc.) that approves (lobbies for) adoption of the new practice.\n\nScience had answered Harari’s 2015 question in 1974 (see Ross, 1974). Science’s answer was very different from Harari’s answer. Science having made its pronouncement forty years ago, have organizations, influenced by that new knowledge, increased the rate at which they adopt new practices? Do organizations look for ways to increase initiating mechanisms and sustaining mechanisms so their performance in adapting to new challenges improves? The answer to both questions is “No.” The Ross theory (1974) of innovation adoption by organizations has not been seen by scientists or by organization leaders. Science’s answer to Harari’s question is buried in the scientific literature and remains undiscovered. Presidents and CEOs today don’t ask “How can we increase initiating mechanisms? How can we increase sustaining mechanisms?” They say “Damnit, I want to see this happen. Make it happen.” They believe in the “change agent” model for innovation adoption by organizations, the CEO being the chief change agent, even though science has “known” for four decades that the change agent model does not work. Not incidentally, science produces more new knowledge each year than even scientists can follow and absorb. It is common enough that scientific knowledge is little utilized in the first century of its existence. Note, for example, that the statistical procedure called factor analysis was invented in 1903, had been vastly improved by 1970 aided by the arrival of digital computers, but is little used in any science today when, in fact, its use would significantly improve the rate at which scientific knowledge grows. Factor analysis handles the task of assessing the influence of each one of many variables on outcomes of interest, a task with which every scientist is faced. Despite factor analysis having been in hand for 100 years, and very usable for 45 years, today’s “gold standard” in scientific study remains having an experimental group and a control group for study, manipulating one variable for the experimental group and not manipulating that variable for the control group, then observing the differences in the outcome of interest in the two groups. Having not learned factor analysis, science advances more slowly and more expensively than need be. Having not learned the importance of initiating mechanisms and sustaining mechanisms for promoting innovation, the pace of innovation today surely continues to fit the trend lines available from innovation-tracking data covering centuries of human history. While ideas are important, as Harari insists, humans are remarkably slow to recognize and adopt many new, worthwhile ideas.\n\nTaking thought is important when examining a problem and making decisions … and taking thought always needs to be done. Sometimes taking thought is the only method available for deciding what is true, most advantageous, best by many standards. Thinking carefully (thinking “slow”) needs to be exercised with diligence (Kahneman, 2011). When you have data – as Harari does in forming this history of humankind thanks to his acquaintance with data from science – this reader strongly prefers the methods and standards of science for deciding what is true and how to estimate likely outcomes that will follow from particular action choices. Harari’s work in Sapiens does not meet those scientific standards.\n\nHarari is sensitive to injustice, to lack of consideration for those affected by our choices. It is a strength of his work.\n\nIf you like a no-holds-barred approach in searching for the “laws” that guide human behavior and our future, if you enjoy watching the tools of the philosopher being used (taking thought, moving words and ideas about), if you’re reading for entertainment, you may find Harari’s work in Sapiens of interest. If you’re looking for a believable advance in knowledge, you’ll find this work bitterly disappointing.\n\nBellevue, Washington\n4 January 2018\n\nCopyright © 2017 by Paul F.

    "The paper and print quality are very poor. Sending fake printed books in the name of special collector's edition and that too without colours. I found a better book through different vendor as compared to this Harsh Books.",
    "'Sapiens' is a short telling of the entire human history, from pre-anatomically modern humans through the agricultural and scientific revolutions and to the present. Or so it attempts to be.\n\nUnfortunately, this enormous task is the book's own undoing. There is no room for any indepth discussions about the various complex issues, and no room to discuss the evidence. The book is filled with assertion after assertion, and virtually nothing to back them up. I looked in the reference section and I was shocked to see how few citations there were. Such a massive subject derserves ten times more citations. If you think you're getting a good scientific description of the facts, don't buy this book. This book is essentially his opinions, and not much else.\n\nAny person who has strong knowledge within any of the subjects in the book will quickly realise that Harari is not an expert on much of what he writes about. He does not just make many claims. He makes many wrong claims. And many, many more misleading ones. It's one of those books that are popular with the layman, but not so much with the expert.\n\nWhen he leaves the topic of evolutionary biology, premodern history, and starts talking about modern history the book gets slighter better. Or is that just because I'm not as well-versed in those topics? Do I just not see his errors there, just like a layperson would not see his errors in his account of evolutionary biology, intelligence research, and more? I won't know. The problem is I can't put much trust in him, because there are so many things wrong or misleading stuff elsewhere. And he doesn't provide sufficient evidence.\n\nEven in the better parts of the book, it is ultimately somewhat dull. Not much new to learn for me, unfortunately. There are so many books about humans, many of them much better than this.\n\nI wouldn't claim that this is the worst book ever, obviously. But to say that it is overhyped is to put it mildly. If you want to read a story, then perhaps you might find it interesting. If you want a factual account that is supported by an honest look at the available evidence, then go somewhere else.",
    "Harari has a knack of weaving complex and interesting concepts into stories, which allows the reader to feel smarter for having understood him. The book is very interesting and despite its length, can be zipped through due to its easy reading style.\n\nUnfortunately, I also have to agree with many of the one star reviewers, that the books downfall is the almost constant speculation he engages in, without providing further evidence.\n\nAs an example, he states 'the creators of the cave paintings at Chauvet, Lascaux and Altmira almost certainly intended them to last for generations.'\n\nThis kind of statement is endemic of the sloppy thinking he engages in, where he will assume something for the sake of the narrative.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if it were in isolation, but it is a pattern repeated throughout the book, where he will base a conclusion off an assumption, then proceed to build a whole story off it. This relegates the book to a speculation rather than a historical account.\n\nI would also advice Christians that he is rather condescending about religion in general and Christianity in particular. He describes Christianity as a 'myth' to be put in the same category as belief in Odin or in Wood Spirits. AS a Non-Christian I was annoyed over his presumptive anti-theism so I have no doubt that many believers will find him infuriating.\n\nTo sum up, this is an interesting and infuriating speculation of the humankind. Take it all with a shaker of salt.",
    "If you are a believer, this book is a total waste of time. It is not at all a history of humankind, as it follows the scientific route. Yet to find scientists who can provide something which, when they are dating something, confirms without any shadow of a doubt that it was there at the beginning!",
    "Of course when you're reading a book, you know the author's views & opinions will be biased, but when you're reading a book, the last thing you want is to be bombarded with strong opinions all the time, subtle hints here and there are good.\n\nI mean, you wrote a book about it, so I think people have a pretty good idea on where you stand, but the author smacks it in your face, and that ruined the book, which is a shame because it had the potential to be a great book, don't get me wrong, this was a good book, but not a great one."

    "I'm not usually one to review books on here (I think plenty of others do, and do a great job!) but as I came to this page to purchase yet another copy of this book to gift a friend, I found myself browsing through some of the reviews and had to respond to some of the criticisms. In essence, I think some of the reviewers here have missed the point entirely.\n\n(One criticism that I do agree with is that the book is heavily focused on the American 20-something experience, yet I do not fault Jay for this--she is an American psychologist, has likely treated predominantly American clients, and is writing for a largely American audience. The \"early life crisis\" of the 20-something that can't decide on a career is a far cry from the issues faced by their peers in impoverished or warring nations, or even those that are similarly developed but culturally distinct. That said, just as I, a 20-something American woman, wouldn't pick up a self-help book written for senior men, I wouldn't pick one up, for example, for those coming of age in China. It's not that one's better or worse than the other, it's just that only one applies to me. I don't think you can get angry about a book addressing the 20-something experience in America when it's written by an American author who makes no assertion that she's writing for a universal audience).\n\n1) \"This book didn't apply to me because I'm in my mid/late 20s and/or have my life together already and/or I already knew all the advice given.\"\nOn one hand, I want to congratulate you, but on another, I think you might have fallen into the millenial trap of being narcissistic and blindly self-assured. Of course many people do graduate college, find a job in a related field, and transition into adulthood without issue. But I imagine that for every person following this path that winds up successful and content with their lives, there are a dozen that end up burnt out and disillusioned by 35, and are forced to reevaluate their decisions and start over. It's not just about choosing a career either--the book proposes mindful selection of friends, partners, and life experiences. With the top speed of modern life, it's easy to continue going through the motions without stopping to think about what you're doing. Even if you feel you're headed in the right direction, what is the value lost by taking the time to consider what you really want? (Also, if you really \"have it all together\" already, why did you read this book in the first place?!)\n\n2) \"It places too much emphasis on finding a partner/having children/living the traditional \"American dream.\"\nThere seems to be a failure of taking the information presented and interpreting the message as it applies to your own life here. The \"hook up\" culture of 20-somethings and the prevalence of domestic abuse are real issues in the US right now. Fertility is also a hot topic, with popular media generating this idea that ANY woman can get pregnant with a little work and hormone injections well into their 40s. Once again, this is about mindfulness, not following a prescribed path. Not interested in settling down with one partner just yet? Fine! But does that mean you want to jump from meaningless hook up to meaningless hook up without learning about yourself and developing an idea of how you'd like your adult relationships to be? Sure you're not ready for kids now, but is it something you see for yourself eventually? How important is it to you? The answer may be not very, and that's okay! The point is to actually THINK about it and be intentional in the choices you make.\n\n3) \"This is just one person's opinion, she does nothing to back it up.\"\nHonestly, this is just ludicrous. Jay integrates *peer reviewed literature* with her own clinical experiences and makes reasonable inferences about patterns in 20-something behavior based on them. You can disagree with the message, but saying that it's being pulled from thin air is just ignorant.\n\n4) \"This book was depressing because it made me feel badly about where I am in my life by my mid/late 20s or 30s.\"\nI understand that some of the information presented can be anxiety-provoking and can make you question your life choices--that's the point! Read the case studies of 20-somethings who were depressed and anxious in their dead end jobs and relationships, they all found a pathway to a more fulfilling life. Even if past the \"sweet spot\" of the early/mid 20s, this book can help you to understand the reality of beginning a career or a family later in life. If you're unhappy with your life and expect a pat on the head and a participation trophy, (\"it gets better!\") this book is not going to help you. If you're lost, unhappy, unfulfilled, or depressed about the state of your life, this book can help you to see these problems as approachable, and models the shift in thinking that will help you to design the life you want for yourself. But 250ish pages written by a psychologist who you haven't met will NEVER be a catch-all solution.\n\nI think this is an important book that those in their late teens or twenties would do well to read, and that older demographics could use to better understand how to support the growth of the 20-somethings in their lives. As with ANY literature, it should be read with a critical eye and with careful consideration of your own experiences, goals, and personal beliefs. The Defining Decade is not written to be a panacea for every struggling 20-something. It does go against the rhetoric 20-somethings are hearing and provide honest, objective examples of how and why taking action in early adulthood is important.",
    "I purchased the paperback edition for my daughter, then immediately purchased the audiobook for myself.\n\nThe primary purpose of this book is to confront the unhelpful assumption that the twenties are merely a time of extended adolescence during which young people should goof off and try to find themselves. The author demonstrates time and again that twenty somethings with focus and jobs and goals are happier and less adrift than those who are attempting to have the time of their lives. Furthermore, the twenties are a time to lay valuable foundations for the rest of your life, whether that be in terms of education and starter jobs or in terms of dating individuals you might have a future with.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections: Work. Love. The Brain and the Body. Without summarizing her actual book, let me point out some of the author's particular gems (from my perspective).\n\nWORK. There is a difference between jobs that build \"capital\" and jobs that can be lumped into the category \"The Starbucks Years\". Your best opportunities are found among your \"weak ties\", not among your Urban Tribe of like-minded thinkers. Don't buy into the myth that everyone else's life is better just because of their carefully-managed Facebook profiles.\n\nLOVE. Don't like the family you were born into? Marriage is a good opportunity to find another family. People who marry young have a higher rate of divorce, but that ends at 25. Couples who live together before marriage are more likely to divorce - unless they were already engaged before moving in together; this occurs because it's easy to slide from dating to sleeping over to living together - and from there to getting engaged to the person you were already living with (even though you wouldn't have considered marrying this \"fun\" partner before moving in together because you didn't consider them marriage material).\n\nTHE BRAIN AND THE BODY. Of course you feel incompetent at work! That's because you are incompetent at work. You're just getting started! Mastery = 10,000 hours on task. Don't forget reproduction. You don't have as long as you think. Worse, if you have your first child at age 40 and they have their first child at age 40, that leads to 80-year-old grandparents. Doctors are seeing an epidemic of adults telling them to keep them alive for at least 20 more years so they can finish raising their children. But the most poignant of all was a tale from a man who had delayed marriage and children so he could have those good times during his twenties that everyone was encouraging him to have - only to realize at 40 that he would give anything to have had 5 extra years with his son instead of 5 years wasted on trivialities.\n\nOverall, a very good read.\n\nThe audiobook was read by the author with her slight Southern twang. It was an enjoyable listen of around 5 hours.",
    "I totally recommend for anyone coming up in age. This book is definitely a game changer. It have You thinking about things and helps you in ways that you didn’t even know. I really recommend this book- from a 22 years old",
    "If you're lost and confused in your twenties then this might be a good book. I'd have gained more from it five years ago but as it stands, it's just a series of therapy sessions mostly focusing on planning weddings, babies, and careers in advance. None of it was particularly mind-altering and I was quite disappointed.",
    "I bought this coz bestdressed my love recommend this, but,\nThis book is not for Indian audience it focuses mainly on America's lifestyle and problem, not saying it's bad I love having new perspectives but the American twentysomething is the focus here, so not recommended if you're Non American",
    "This book is just amazing. I kind of wish I could sit down with the author some day, but once I have finished the book, that may not even be needed.\n\nEven though I am in my late late 20s, I can still see much benefit in the book. The concept of identity capital is something I am finding very useful, and now that I understand it, it pops up in my mind when I am making career choices which is great. I feel it has enhanced and open up my mind, while at the same time making it easy for me to make choices, or at least to understand exactly what it is that I am trading/gaining when I choose one career option over another.\n\nIt's also awesome that the author has actually counselled many young people like ourselves, and we get to see this often inside the book. While reading, I often feel like I am a third party looking at my own life and my own thought processes- that is how relatable the book is.\n\nThis is the kind of book you would be eager to pass on once you have read it, but I bought it on kindle, so thankfully, I can keep it. Thank you so much Dr Meg for this contribution to the world.",
    "Definitely not your average self help book and I loved how it really catered to my age group with solid examples and tough love. Reflection and self-awareness is important and I liked the encouragement.\n\nThat being said, there was a strange amount of focus on the body clock for females and the book felt very loaded in that aspect. I can't give 5 stars because a book of similar calibre without panicking us about our ovaries feels more deserving, but until I find that, I absolutely still recommend this bad boy.",
    "I loved reading this book and have recommended it to lots of friends! If you're early twenties is a useful bit of advice, - basically don't be lazy and plan your life so you don't waste it, and in your mid to late twenties it's a real kick up the bum, I wouldn't advise it for 30s,bit harsh then. Useful anecdotes, wish there was a second one with more specific advice and guidance."

    "This book has a lot of good information in it, and while I think it's information that we all know deep down, sometimes you need someone to plainly say it (or write it) to remind you. At least that is how it was in my case.\n\nWhen I read it the first time I remember loving it, it was brilliant and while I didn't feel like I agreed with everything in it, a lot of what was taught in it shaped some of my views on love. At the time, I hadn't had much experience in relationships, in fact I think it was pretty recent after the end of my very first relationship. However, a lot of what was in this book really stuck with me, so just before Yule this year I took the time to run to the store and pick up two copies of it. One for my boyfriend (as a gift) and one for myself to read again. Really, I'm glad that I did.\n\nReading it this time, I feel like I agreed with a lot more of what he said, and that I soaked more of it in. It didn't do much to change how I feel about relationships or love, because they were pretty similar to begin with. It did reaffirm them for me though, and put into words a lot of how I felt. Enough that when I finished reading it I had the urge to pass it along, so that a certain friend of mine could take the time and read it, in hopes that it would reaffirm things for him. Especially the most important things that deal with self love, self destruction, the \"Parasite\" inside of us all, and how the way others act should not affect us and vice versa. It really opened my eyes, and I feel like sharing the knowledge I feel I've gained from it. I'll probably buy it again in a few months.\n\nThis book really speaks towards the way society can implant negative thoughts on us, and how we can be raised to believe them. We are all born innocent and full of love, and somewhere along the way we learn how to be distrustful, and how to be hurt, and to be hurtful in return. Our parents learned this while they grew, and they (along with the rest of society) then teach it to us as we grow up, and the cycle continues ever onward. Personally, I would hope that I have the strength to stop that cycle, and leave my children full of love and respect.\n\nAnother thing it tells us, is the story of \"The Man Who Didn't Believe in Love\", which is now one of my favorite legends. It tells of a man who went around giving lectures on the non-existence of love, because so many people use it to manipulate each other. He says \"love is like a drug\" because in each relationship you have the \"dealer\" of the \"drug\" and the person who is addicted and keeps coming back for more. The stronger partner deals out the love, and the weaker tries to soak up as much of it as they can, and they take any abuse the dealer gives out too, because they think they need it so badly and that they can't get it anywhere else. He vows that he does not believe in love, because he has had many such experiences and refuses to let anyone manipulate him with this false emotion.\n\nSo this man is walking through the park one day and he comes across a woman who is sitting in the grass crying. He stops to console her, and asks her why she is crying, and she replies \"I am crying because love does not exist.\" The man is astounded, because he has finally found a woman who feels the same way he does. He talks to her, they develop a friendship, and soon they are spending all their time together. They never fight, and they never expect anything from each other, they have the perfect bond. One day when the man is away, he is contemplating his relationship with the woman. He realizes that what he feels for her must actually be love, and that he had been wrong all along. Love does exist, and it is much more pure and beautiful than anything he'd ever experienced. The man is so excited that he rushes home immediately to tell her how he feels about her. She, in turn, replies that she has felt this way for quite some time and has been afraid to tell him because of his disbelief in the emotion.\n\nThe legend then tells that the man is so happy, that he goes outside and sends his happiness into the universe. His happiness is so large that it pulls a star down into his hands and he hurries to give it to the woman. The happiness is so overwhelming, that for a moment the woman hesitates, and in that moment of doubt she drops it and it shatters. Now there is a man who is wandering the Universe, broken and lonely because he once again believes that love does not exist. There is also a woman who sits at home waiting for the man who once loved her, feeling remorse for that one moment of doubt that ruined their relationship.\n\nSo in asking yourself who was in the wrong, was it the woman who doubted for a moment? No, it was the man who decided to place his entire happiness in someones hands. If we place all of our happiness in the control of others, how can we ever expect to be happy? It is entirely up to us to be happy, and if we choose to be happy with someone else, we're all the better. We cannot rely on them to make us happy.\n\nThe book delves into quite a bit more information regarding loving yourself and being a whole person. It also emphasizes my previous belief that you have to be happy on your own, if you can ever be happy with anyone else. You have to love yourself to fully love another, and you have to be an equal part to a relationship, and not rely on them. It is the same with friends, family, and anyone you encounter.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you read it simply to remind yourself of what you knew before. He has at least 3 other books that go along with it, and I plan on reading them as well.\n\nRemember, God = Love and God is inside of you.\n\nSo YOU = LOVE.",
    "This book showed up in my life at just the right moment (no surprise there). It is a life changing book when we are ready to integrate this truth into our lives. Simple, easy to read yet pausing to let the depth of it sink into our hearts is a good way to read this book. The teacher shows up when the student is ready.",
    "Came as promised",
    "Anyone who is in a relationship or consider it getting into a relationship needs to read this book.we judge and criticize our partners as if we are the victim. The truth is we are both victim and victimizer. We can have deep and meaningful relationships. Ruiz presents a simple and clear path to open, honest relationships. It was a relief to hear that I am only responsible for 50% of any of my relationships!",
    "Absolutely what everyone needs! Perfect book for any life situations",
    "I love all of his books!",
    "Everyone knows what love feels like, or most people do. But from this book, I was able to really understand where it comes from and how to manage it. Also from a logical perspective understanding its value.",
    "Loved every aspect of the book, second book from this author and I love all his books so far. Recommended buying",
    "Admittedly I thought this was going to be a bit 'space-cadetish' when it was recommended to me by a fellow survivor of divorce, but having too much time on my hands to keep delving deeper into matters that have never spiked my interest before and finding myself sometimes pleasantly surprised and somewhat changed by the end at times, I thought I'd give this a whirl. And wow, I was changed. In short, I think this book should be handed out in schools. I don't think I've ever read anything like this before but it has really opened my eyes as well as a world of new possibilities.\nI think this will be a new favourite author for me.",
    "I recommend this to anyone who is going through a breakup, feeling alone or lonely, needs a beautiful reminder to reconnect with your most inner God/Goddess being to realise how powerful you are to create the most amazing relationships starting with the one between you and you!",
    "Reading your book \"The Mastery Of Love\" don Miguel Ruiz ,what a remarkable read that is.\nMuch of what I read comes from my own inner guidance and I couldn't have said it any better.\nIt has been simplified to such extent that anyone will grasp its wisdom, even a growing child.\nI am so grateful for being a rebel- undomesticatable.\nI'm so grateful for following my inner most sacret zing, despite all abuse, despite all judgement, despite the pain and insecurities I've moved along with.\nI feel blessed, truly.\nI can only be MYSELF. It is the simplest and most easiest things of all.\nThe hardest thing of all is to shed family members, always with sincere LOVE & GRATITUDE.\nNever because you hate them and ALWAYS BECAUSE YOU LOVE AND RESPECT SELF.\n\nThank you for sharing your knowledge and wisdom with us all.\nIt goes without saying that I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is in the path of SELF LOVE.\nTheir own unique path.",
    "The simple and easy to understand language resonates with me deeply and caught me at a time when I was already moving in the direction he is pointing. Great to gain a little more clarity around self love and sharpen my resolve. Love his three basic tenants of: do not believe what I tell you, do not believe what you tell yourself and don’t believe others. I know out of context this doesn’t exactly make sense. You have got to read the book, I guess.",
    "This book made me look at myself more to try and see love in everything and everyone, no matter what. I love that you can be in love the rest of your life even when negative situations happen. Highly recommend for everyone on their self development journey! Highly recommend for anyone looking at ways to love themselves"

    "I thought I had, especially as the best book I've read in two or three decades. This is one remarkable, almost entirely unique, (I'll say it now) masterpiece by Gabor Mate. I told him so in an email to him.\n\nFew books really ought be required reading, but this is one of them. Mate, not least himself a behavioral addict, understands addictions like no one I've ever read or ever listened to. He gets it. And he gets near to the roots of addiction as anyone ever has. And then he critiques ridiculous public policy stuck in the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages can be excused for lack of access to data, writing materials, etc., etc., while modern nations cannot be excused for such reasons.\n\nBut nations, led by persons addicted to power and wealth and a hundred other behaviors and substances, insist more on character assassination, placing of self-blame and then punishment I doubt Torquemada ever contemplated on such a vast scale--when 50% or so of America's extremely high prison population consists of addicts (now ex-addicts the hard way if they can't get drugs in prisons) whose violations of law were so minor as to have warranted no more (indeed, no less) than admission to places who think it a better idea to help addicts as opposed to punishing them. But when traditional \"values\" continue to prevail...outcome is to be expected--draconian at all times pretty much no matter the problem.\n\nOne wonders just how far backward a society or civilization can move before collapsing of its own gluttony for punishment.\n\nAddiction is a sociological problem, not a psychological problem, or at worst a mix of the two. Mate understands this perfectly and has told Canadian officials as much insofar as Mate is Canadian transplanted from Hungary where he was born a Jew about the time WWII got going.\n\nI've put it more strongly than Mate does; he's nicer about it, though I doubt he's any more patient. But only a relatively small part of the book is devoted to discussion of public policy.\n\nMostly, the book tells the stories of individual addicts Mate knows or has known (prior to their suicides or murders) on Vancouver's less swank east side. He writes of Native Canadians, who like their American kin, are more prone to addiction, not least for the way they've been regarded by the dominant races and classes. It's not as though they're more prone because native! One reads such crap all the time, however, and so Mate is refreshing as mountain air after years in a stinking city.\n\nWhat he writes was for me as I read utterly familiar, as though he'd taken the words from my mouth. He didn't, but just said it for me and far better than I could ever have said it. Plus, he's an actual physician with access to actual data as well as to other experts on the topics of addiction and psychology, and sociology too. This book is also science at it's best, in relation to the world beyond the theoretical.\n\nThere's actual evidence, quite a lot of it, in support of Mate's claims, up to and including studies of the human brain, of what endorphins are, of how they are released and taken up in and by the brain, of how not all people really are created equal (politically in the blind eyers of the law perhaps, but not psychologically or physiologically. And not economically either). They're not, as any dope, so to speak, who thought about it for 30 seconds could not help but conclude. Addicts are sufferers in ways many of us can't imagine, while on the other hand lots of us can very well imagine and then indulge for ourselves, whether in substances or repetitive behaviors, either or both in hope of relief, not least from societal judgment.\n\nThe stories are, well...cliche because like most cliche's so true...heartbreaking. Some terrible, terrible things go on all around us, a lot of it happening to children who will grow up to become addicts. (Then we'll play the blame game; namely, blame them for having made poor choices in life. What nonsense. Such game-playing ought be called what it really is, a cop out, a refusal to take responsibility for the world in which we all dwell. Easier to blame the victim for his or her plight. Poof, gone, what problem? Oh him? He deserves whatever happens, as does everyone. \"One gets what one really wants.\" There's no end to such \"\"common wisdom\" that dispense with reality giving nary a thought, let alone another idea. Such are customs and traditions born of ideologies.)\n\nMate would change our systems of beliefs, as would all who tell us the truth refusing to allow us to continue to hide behind curtains consisting of myths.\n\nObviously, I couldn't possibly recommend this book more as absolutely essential reading and on a topic slightly wider than the one advertised. Yes, it's about addicts and their various addictions, but deeper down it's a commentary on the state of our collective being. We've been pretty bad and don't seem much interested in being better, I might add. Instead we're building more prisons and fewer schools, clinics, hospitals or half-way houses liberals don't want in their backyards. We're becoming yet more hypocritical, not less so.\n\nMate exposes us as much as the addicted, perhaps more so. I won't misstate him: He's firmly against addiction, spends much of his life trying to help people out of their addictions as he's helped himself out of his own. He doesn't dismiss personal responsibility, not in the least. Millions of addicts wouldn't make for much in the way of a functioning civilization either. Mate is tough on his patients, sometimes overly so, as he writes.\n\nBut my favorite part, if you will, is when he writes of \"authenticity,\" specifically of that he's discovered in that east side community, where addicts and hangers on, and other of society's outcasts speak and act with an authenticity unknown in society at large. I suppose that when you've hit bottom there's nothing more to be frightened of, even if fear is often at the root of or the cause of mental illnesses, whether or not addictions are regarded as mental illnesses. (I personally think so.) But there is no room, space or time for pretense among those for whom he cares enough to devote so much of his time and effort.\n\nCould we EVER use some of that authenticity in our daily dealings, in our politicians claiming to be \"leaders,\" especially in business gone global, and most especially in foolish media where myths go to be nourished and enriched. Addicts have a lot of important things to say, far more worth listening to than some glorified, media-hyped pol, movie star, whatnot otherwise idiot.\n\nI mean the hardcore addict of whom Mate writes and treats as best he can and in more ways than as physician. When he writes of their authenticity I can just feel what he means. I KNOW what he means, also in part for the lack of it I discover or rediscover every day in my own dealings with others and in listening to media, to those who speak through media, who have ready access to media and who are looking out for their own desperate neediness first and foremost. The hardcore addict is far more honest, far more in touch with just being human, which is to be weak at the knees for all time while never ever allowed just to say so.\n\nGabor Mate is philosopher too, one who will make you think, including about what is right and what is wrong, about authentic values, as opposed to those \"family\" ones always on the lips of politicians and so many of their backers, all of them clueless as to the actual nature of morality, never mind answers.\n\nIt's not a self-help book though it does help a self whether or not a self asks for help, and it's not cure-all book, in the event anyone still imagines there could ever be such a thing. Mate, like a few others, Erickson, Chomsky, Marcuse, et al. and just to name some of the more recent, has a firm grip on what really matters, and so this book is about more than some junkies and their personal problems along with his own problems or even just all of our problems. It's about all those things, but by its tone--which is NEVER patronizing--and by its insight and revelation the book is also speculative philosophy in an at least one very fine tradition of non-tradition as practiced by those just mentioned and a few others, all of whom ought be essential reading for any who claims to be a citizen of the world.",
    "I started reading this book after a former student of mine overdosed. I wanted to somehow make sense of what she was experiencing and why it ultimately led to her death at 20 years old. And understand my deceased brother’s addiction. I also wanted to further understand my own addictive tendencies and learn more about how the brain works. It took me a long time to read this. I found I could only read a chapter at a time to fully digest all of the information. And it also is highly emotional as Gabor Mate describes in depth his medical relationship to addicts and all of their struggles as well as battling his own behavioral addiction. It delves into trauma and the phrase “hungry ghosts”. I found myself sometimes feeling hopeless for the people he treats and all that suffer with addiction and all of society. Gabor Mate is a powerful story teller. He drives home the point we need to have compassion and not judgment. I learned a lot about trauma, harm reduction, the failed political “war on drugs”, racism, and the complicated topic of drug legalization and criminalization. There is also some counsel in the latter chapters on how to help oneself. His personal story woven into the book adds a sense of understanding and empathy towards his patients.",
    "It is widely accepted that addiction is genetic, making some of us feel that we were predisposed to a lifetime of disaster. A biological life sentence. Maté postulates that a child’s environmental factors are the driving force behind maladaptive behavior. Think about it - if I am raised in a lower socioeconomic environment there is a known chance that I will be exposed to: over-policing, poverty which goes hand and hand with crime, trauma, emotional dysregulation, inadequate school systems, fewer job opportunities, greater access to drugs and a higher population of people struggling with addiction. The likelihood of raising further generations in that “lower rung” of society is more probable than not. So is it genetic or systemic? Causation or correlation? What happens when a set of identical twins with the same genetics are separated at birth and adopted to two vastly different families on the wealth spectrum? What would you guess happens differently with each child? Maté’s work shares a realistic account that most people suffering with addiction can attest to. The way in which most people struggling with addiction are treated in this country is not only ineffective, it is detrimental and exacerbates an already precarious situation. It becomes no surprise that it is so socially acceptable to treat those struggling with addiction with contempt and disregard. How did we get to a place that offers so little humanity? This book addresses that issue and describes alternate methods to get better results. Why wouldn’t we adjust our methods of education and treatment if better options are out there? This book is so important, if you’re struggling with addiction, if you love someone struggling or if you are treating those - please read this and help spread the word. Most people who use drug are not the stereotypes so often depicted. Most people use to escape a painful past or situation. Most of us never developed healthy coping mechanisms, the ability to emotionally regulate because we learned from parents who also struggled and most of us are highly sensitive people who want desperately to change. Please hear the message that you are worthy of love, you are capable of change and life can get better even though it might feel hopeless right now.",
    "Great book written by a man of enormous humility and authenticity. His decades of clinical experience allows him to seemingly effortlessly write in poetic detail, of the objective and subjective perspectives of traumatized human Souls whose only means of getting through each day is the brief relief of drugs addiction. Highly recommend for clinicians and nonclinicians alike.",
    "I really like Gabor Mate and wanted to love this book. It started great with description of addiction cases, people problem's and explaining how addicted brain works but then he got bogged down into politics and what government does/doesn't in the War on Drugs. I was more interested about how to manage/solve addictions. There is some information about it but not enough. The most practical chapter was for me chapter 31 ''Four Steps Plus One''. Even for this chapter the book was worth a buy. His writing style is also excellent. I'm going to read some more of his books.\nPS Just realised that chapter 31 was based on Jeffrey M. Schwartz's book ''Brain Lock'' which I'm going to read next.",
    "Read this book whilst I was in treatment. It really hit a chord with me, is so real and so honest. Dr Mate with some of the most desperate addicts in Canada, there is nothing he hasn't seen and there is nothing that can shock him. However he sees the humanity in these people with addictions, and he also sees his own addictive behaviour for what it is. Whilst it may seem a painful comparison to compare potentially fatal IV drug addictions to Dr Mate's compulsive CD buying, he handles this topic sensitively and highlights the universality of addiction.\nThe stories he tells a heartbreaking, but his approach to the psychobiology of addiction is eye-opening and enlightening. He explains what could be a tricky subject in a really easy to access way. This book helped me understand more about myself, my struggles, and the struggles of the people. The book highlights that there is hope and talks extensively about the barriers to recovery and why these exist. I highly recommend this book to anybody with any interest in addictive behaviour.",
    "Addiction, affects so many of us in so many ways, eating, gambling, shopping, sex, addiction is addiction. It seems that we as society dehumanise some addicts while throwing a veil over our own because , well, we’re not like THEM, the Wino’s and Junkies, the thieving Scum, no we’re not addicted like THAT. Truth is no one knows the experiences that put people in such scary, vulnerable positions, this book reveals the stories behind the addiction, the science, the reasons why this war on drugs won’t work and shows us that yes, these people , like all people, are Human After All.",
    "All Gabor Mate’s writing is written sensitively, from the heart. He tends to focus on childhood trauma as the dominant factor in all addictive behaviour, or brain chemistry imbalance, ADHD etc, but my clinical experience says that this is not always true.\nHe does not seem to take into account nutrition, which I personally believe has more to do with deficient neuro chemistry than any other factor - and have had better results changing diet than using psychotherapy for these behaviours.\nNevertheless, an interesting read.",
    "Gabor writes beautifully with such depth and meaning. Don't be fooled by the title, this book isn't just for addicts or budding psychologists/psychiatrists, all should read. I myself have gained amazing insight into myself and others and has given me the scope to look at life at another angle."

    "Some might say Ryan Holiday's Daily Stoic is a cult that follows an ancient philosophy; a philosophy that is difficult to grasp and easily misunderstood. Who knows if that is true? Stoicism and its proponents, however, swear by the mental toughness it provides in an ever-dysfunctional and stressful world that we're all facing.\n\nThis book - part of the trilogy - The Way, The Enemy, and The Key - is an easy-to-digest series of tenants and examples of how one embodies stoicism and one of its prime tenants -- turning an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nIt reminds me of Robert Greene's manuals for modern society (48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, 33 Strategems of War, The Laws of Human Nature), in that THE OBSTACLE provides a tremendous amount of practical advice for dealing with adversity. We all will face adversity 1000s of times in our lives, and to be prepared for it, to overcome it requires knowledge of self and knowing that others have succeeded on a path similar to yours (if only in ambition). You get an understanding of how to critically think for yourself, which improves character and that is worth its weight in gold and silver.",
    "While I know Ryan personally, I believe that I am uniquely qualified to review this book and, after reading a lot of the comments, add to the discussion. A lot of people miss that Ryan is articulating a journey and is translating it into something edible and powerful. Something 99% of us at ANY age cannot do, even with \"wisdom of experience\".\n\nStorytelling has been around since the beginning of time, but actual mass communication has been around for a very short time (relatively). It looks as if the \"paper book\" business will become a specialty- if surviving at all. I know that Ryan knows this as he has always been quick to lend an idea, do some digging and most important- analyze and decide. As he uses as an example in his book, he pulls an Amelia Earhart and ACTS. He can talk about Tesla in the same sentence as popular games on the meat markets in early Chicago. He has read (studied) Marshall McLuhan to Malcolm Gladwell. This rabid quest to find out and face his own soul searching path- has delivered a perfect book for the RIGHT PERSON. This is not Chicken Soup for the Soul.\n\nRyan has done WAY more and influenced WAY more decisions than he would ever talk about, but has helped untangle talent and communication complications (i.e- market properly) using many of his methods he developed under Robert Greene and even 50 Cent and Tucker Max. He helped in stealth, but in critical ways, to launch, maintain and capitalize on #1 Films, TV Shows, YouTube and MANY multi platinum musical artists. I can vouch for it myself.\n\nIt is always amazing to read a review somewhere when that person has never faced down rejection and fear and can criticize anyone for at least putting their thoughts and ideas out there for judgment. To do that, when the WORLD is telling you that finishing college is the only way to go and you have the same people close to you saying that you will fail- it truly was an Obstacle to overcome. It only got more intense for Ryan, but his lessons are earned. He was led to the water, but unlike most people, he drank. How can you question the message, integrity and courage of that? Steven Pressfield, one of our generations best and most diverse authors, has called it \"The Resistance\". Even he endorsees the book on the dust jacket.\n\nThe reason that I preface the review this way is to show you Ryan's true accomplishment here- articulating what he has learned, applying it to clear examples people can remember and also help people. There have been big choices in Ryan's life- not the least of which was whether to go in house for a safe \"job\" or \"bet on himself\". He DID what he talks about here. It is the true reflection on a part of his life and the methods HE used to combat them. This is especially important for a generation who \"has ADD\" and can't relate to the past. At 22- I think it would be silly to not monitor this refreshing voice and mind as he progress'. He actually went and spent time with Dr. Drew after reading his not so best selling books.\n\nMarcus Aurelius is the clear hero in this book, being compared to boxer \"Hurricane\" Carter (among others), while dealing with your internal power. The ideas and themes of the book seem to come from some Herman Hesse and Tom Wolfe as much as out of print magazines and long dead historical stars of their time. That is what is so attractive. Anyone should find a part of this to relate to. This is especially helpful to someone who wants a quick boost of intellect instead of trying to muscle through a biography (but he def refers to a lot of interesting people I need to read more about). Ryan does not rely on the same tired stereotyped figures from the past, but finds new, more relatable, characters and situations. Athletes, Entrepreneurs, Parents and CEO's, and those looking to look at life in a certain lens, will benefit greatly.\n\nThink you are having a bad day? Open your eyes and you will find out that another historical leader (other than Churchill) suffered severe depression while running the country that may or may not exist depending on his choices- Abraham Lincoln (didn't see a lot of that in the movie). Grant, Nietzsche and Edison all make a story about fortitude and acceptance. A much different approach than looking in a window and imaging you will get the new purse that is in there and moving on. Again- this is intended for action and not philosophy.\n\nSelf Help crap would be fine if it worked, but that means there would only be one book- and it would work. Awareness. Dealing with fear and uncertainty. Mindful and deliberate. Shame and guilt. Accountability and results. How did other people deal with this? Only through careful research do these stories become just as powerful to the man who believes that history is a verb as they are to someone just trying to make it through their day.\n\nThe point is- you are not alone. In fact, you are not even close to being the first person today to experience multiple obstacles. It is comforting to see how adversity has been confronted in the past. This is a book for those who believe in Realpolitik and seeing life for what it is. I would say it is the actual back up action plan to what a mystical book like the Mayan based best seller, \"The 4 Agreements\", is. Although the book is very much based on stoic principles it makes no judgements about your belief system in a macro way.\n\nI can see how this book can have some legs for people try to cope with a new world where you have too much or think you have too little- information to ingest. It is a reference book that can be returned to over and over.\n\nRyan Holiday is an important voice in the book space these days. Mostly because he is willing to actually commit to writing good books as well as growing his digital presence quickly. Non fiction at that age in 2014 is pretty impressive and patient. He can deal w Dov Charney, 50 Cent, Tucker Max and many others- due to his diversity. His \"Read to Lead\" mentality is refreshing and way more valuable than any class. He has a Best Seller in \"Growth Hacking\" at the same time, so holding his own with decades older armchair authors, while understanding the generation gap in communication is not such a bad way to describe this book.\n\nAnd finally...yes- he uses the bible as reference at times..",
    "Seriously. Whatever you’re facing… pain, boredom, tiredness, frustration, etc. can be flipped upside down. You get one life… get to living it and not bemoaning it.",
    "No doubt, you are trying to get ahead in whatever ‘getting ahead’ means to you. But so often an obstacle seems to stand in your way. Yes, there are a few people who report having planned their charmed life or their business success and had it unfold almost exactly as planned, and with style and elegance. Amazing, but never true. Most people blocked by the obstacles of time, money, connections, opportunity and more, do nothing.\nThis book has a fascinating take on ‘being stuck’ – it is a primer on how to turn adversity to advantage, as the subtitle explains.\nLet me state upfront – I am bored by motivational talks and books. I find very little about them interesting or useful twelve hours later. This book is not a motivational text, though it is motivating as many good books are.\nThe “Ancient Art” of the subtitle is referring to the wisdom and insight of the Stoic philosophers. These writings or thoughts influenced all the people Holiday uses as examples of this approach to obstacles of life. The circumstances of these people would leave most disoriented, reactive, torn and even paralyzed. As Holiday shows “some seem to turn those very obstacles, which stymie us, into launching pads for themselves.”\nKnowing that there are heroes doesn’t help us to become heroes, but knowing how they became heroes, does. The value of this book is that it offers an ancient and profound method and framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting in the face of the obstacles life throws at us.\nTurning obstacles into the way forward takes many forms. For the great Athenian orator, Demosthenes, it was a relentless drive to improve himself through action and practice. For Abraham Lincoln it was humility, endurance, and compassionate will. In each case, all the people cited in this book were not born with the attributes it took to succeed, and many faced unimaginable horrors, from imprisonment to debilitating illnesses, and of course the day-to-day frustrations we all endure.\nSo, what did they do? “They had the ability to see obstacles for what they were, the ingenuity to tackle them, and the will to endure a world mostly beyond their comprehension and control,” Holiday explains.\nThe perspective is not a self-delusional, positive and happy one, ‘this is not so bad’, but rather, ‘I can make this good’.\nThe starting point is maintaining a state of mind that one of Holiday’s examples, the extraordinary businessman, John D. Rockefeller, had perfected: cool headedness and self-discipline.\nWhen America send the first astronauts into space, they trained them in one skill more than in any other: the art of not panicking. When people panic, they make mistakes. They just react, but not to what they need to react to, but to their survival hormones. At 150 miles above Earth, panic is suicide. Panic had to be trained out of the astronauts and it does not go easily. It must be trained away, through persistent, repeated attempts at not panicking, until you don’t.\nTalent isn’t the most important characteristic for success, grace and poise are, because these precede the opportunity to deploy your talent.\nThe action after the panic allows for a change of perception that is a prerequisite for right action. George Clooney spent his first years in Hollywood getting rejected at every audition. He desperately wanted the producers and directors to like him, and they didn’t. He blamed them for not seeing how good he was. His life changed when he changed perspective, from self-centredness to that of other-centeredness, not possible in panic mode.\nProducers need to find the right actor to cast in their film, and they all hope that the next person to walk into the room is the right actor. When Clooney realized that he was the answer to their prayers, not the other way around, his performance improved and so did his career.\nConsider the refusal to fund your company. I could be an obstacle, or a call for a change of action. Getting the person to fund you this isn’t up to you, but the decision to refine and improve your presentation is.\nConsider the number of exceptional businesses started during depressions or economic crises.\nFortune magazine was founded soon after the crash of 1929. Hewlett-Packard, and Revlon in the Great Depression. General Motors in the panic of 1907. Microsoft in the recession in 1973-75. LinkedIn during the burst of the dot-com bubble. Half the companies in the Fortune 500 were started under adverse conditions.\nRather than focus on the difficulties of an economy in free-fall, they focused on what they needed to do to succeed, and that produced the difference. This difference requires presence of mind.\nAndy Grove, former CEO of Intel, said “Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.” In like fashion, great individuals find a way to transform weakness into strength.\nThis is essentially a very practical book which will introduce you to a wealth of important ideas beyond what I have introduced in this column. They will be of extraordinary value as you try to facedown business crises.\n\nReadability Light --+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High -+--- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of the soon to be released ‘Executive Update’.",
    "This had lots of good reviews and was recommended by a Stoic site, but I don't think it is worth having. I've read about half up to now and I'm losing interest, I doubt I'll finish reading it. Lots of heartwarming examples of people who were not actually Stoics but exhibited some form of Stoic behaviour don't really convince me that the author had anything useful to say. The book feels like he padded it out to make the word count, there's little in the way of original insights or things you didn't realise. The fact that he uses a lot of stories from American sports is something I personally find tedious, I have no idea who the people are or what he's writing about. I really dislike chapters that are three pages long. I also found his use of English was poor, it's not fluid, you constantly notice how he's expressed himself, rather than what he's said. Good English should be unobtrusive and flow from the page to the reader's mind without you noticing it.\n\nHe does explain the basics, so it's not a bad book to read if you have never encountered Stoic ideas before, but he doesn't seem to cover the subject in any depth. I'm waiting for him to introduce concepts like Eudaimonia and Apatheia, but this book reads too much like a self-help book for my taste. He's constantly offering military insights, not all of them accurate (The German attack on Poland in 1939 was a series of Kesselslachen, not Blitzkrieg). Lots of them are about American generals, quite a rich field where you can find many good examples, but after a quick introduction of Sherman (for example), he briefly discusses his personal qualities and he then moves on. Sherman wasn't a stoic (He was a Catholic as an adult), it's as if the author is trying to find things that can be used to support his views. Sherman was mired in controversy several times in his life and had a nervous breakdown in 1861. He was an effective general but not a good choice to support the book's narrative. This book is more like a magazine article or an essay written by someone who knows nothing about the subject but has researched it well on-line.\nThere are a lot of better books to read on the subject that offer more depth and better insights. I'd not recommend this book to anyone who showed any interest in the subject.",
    "Have you ever seen those ads on the internet? “Change your life today for only all of your money”. And you are taken to some badly written course outline that reeks of a pyramid scheme. The self help world is riddled with cons and Ryan Holiday is the latest addition.\n\nThe man is a tv marketer by background - he knows how to fool the masses. And he has somehow managed to get his online badly written life changing course printed.\n\nHe basically takes a few basic stoic concepts - don’t worry about what you can’t control, work hard, remain positive etc - and spin a book out of it. Throw in the names of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca along with some modern anecdotes and you are deemed a genius, according to a few people on the back (who clearly haven’t read the book or are part of the self help pyramid scheme)\n\nThe anecdotes themselves are horribly cliché. Just name drops people that everyone will know such as Edison, Lincol, Eisenhower, the Lakers (marketing 101 - don’t lose your audience). The bits and bobs of history are so basic and sometimes just wrong - I’m not sure he even bothered to google some of it.\n\nThe attempts at motivation amount to little other than “are you ready to go to work? Let’s get to work!”\n\nThe writing is blatantly dreadful and nauseating “Lincoln possessed an inner mental fortress that girdered him” Jesus.\n\nIt might seem like a good book if you are under 20 and haven't read any self help books before but if you’ve ever read any few before this, you will be quite disappointed with this.",
    "I had high expectations for this book which it didn't quite live up to. Ryan Holiday opens this book and bases his narrative around a quote by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which indicates there are 3 critical steps to overcoming an obstacle: (i) perspective, (ii) action and (iii) will/perseverance.\n\nThe book is then subsequently sectioned into 3 parts on (i) perspective, (ii) action and (iii) will/perseverance. Each part is divided into roughly 8-10 sub sections. Each sub section is several pages long and offers one key insight. e.g. perspective can be objective/subjective or perspectives create opportunities etc etc.\n\nThe book uses anecdotes of successful historical figures to validate ideas which includes the use of Politicians (Lincoln, Roosevelt), Athletes (Hurricane Carter), George Clooney to name a few. There is also many references to Stoic philosophers (Epictetus, Demosthenes, Marcus etc).\n\nOverall I agreed mostly with the proposition of the book. I didn't however believe that the anecdotes supply sufficient reasoning to argue these points. It felt that the author cherry-picked case-studies to fit his narrative.\n\nI also tended to find the writing style was slightly awkward and a lot of sentences were of this nature: \"leadership requires determination, energy and courage\" which by itself often seemed irrelevant. The author also feels the need to use 2 descriptive words at all instances, e.g. \"It's easier to persist in our efforts and actions than to endure the uncomfortable or the painful\"\n\nFurthermore, if the reader has read about Stoicism before (e.g. The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by Irvine) then much of the Stoic ideas are recycled. For an introduction to Stoicism with logical arguments I would recommend Irvine (5* read).\n\nTo conclude I feel the overall idea is good. This book will be useful for anyone who has to deal with adverse circumstances. It will appeal to people who prefer anecdotes over reasoning.",
    "I have both the audio book and the paper copy of this book. I first got the audio book and thought somehow the content sounded just plain repetitive - different words same message; so thought I'd read the book instead so that I can follow it with more attention. But it transpired that page after page after page may have been filled by the author with words but it is repetition, repetition, and yet more repetition of the message behind the content. If that was deliberate then well done to the author, he nailed it. For those readers and seekers of wisdom (or better understanding of stoicism) find and stick to a good translation of Meditations book of Marcus Aurelius instead; that's where you'll find the originality.",
    "I'm no expert on Stoic philosophy but my understanding of it was that can help us be more calm and resilient. Holiday repackages it into some kind of motivation way to make money in order to be successful. The likes of Marcus Aurelious and Seneca would turn in their graves if their philosophy was compared to unscrupulous business owners like John D Rockefellar. He thinks that just by inserting Stoicism on the front cover and a load of philosophical quotes, he can verify his message. He often power phrases these quotes so that he can subtly twist their meaning to suit his own narrative. His main message seems to be that other people are our enemies and they must be vanquished at all costs. I can imagine someone like Patrick Bateman (American Psycho) or Hitler, before invading Poland, lapping this up. Okay Hitler was a bit extreme. He also often contradicts himself, for example we should never give up, but a few pages later, we should never be wedded to a position or some things in life are bigger than us. We should not worry if our actions limit or hurt others and then we should consider their feelings. We need to take urgent action and then we shouldn't be in a hurry. He also randomly mentions we can control what we desire....\nHe also says we should ignore our feelings and perceptions. While I agree that we should be skeptical of our feelings as they can be unhelpful, we should from time to time at least try to understand where they come from. His approach seems to be to bury our heads in the sand, this seems like the road to toxic masculinity. He likes a bit of good old fashioned male bravado, life is a race and you have to win.\nHe doesn't take into account simple bad luck and other variables and simply repeats page after page that we need to tackle our problems. We do, but there are other things at play.\nFor example if our boss asks something unfeasible at work we shouldn't question it, just put our head down and work harder. Working harder seems to be his main tip for a better life, making him sound like Boxer from Animal Farm. Don't question authority or the status quo, just shut up and get on with it. I can imagine what he thinks of protests like BLM.\nThere are some useful tips however, such as approach obstacles as an opportunity to practice a virtue, such as patience, forgiveness or courage and that we are in control of how we react to our problems. Also we are all guilty of procrastination at times and could benefit from more action. I agree that life is hard and often things contradict themselves. (I'm doing it in this review)\nI agree that a degree of anxiety is required in every life but Holiday's approach will have people slitting their wrists and having sky high blood pressure all over the place. He's reinforcing a dog eat dog world where there has to winners and losers. If you're not the next Steve Jobs, cunningly defeating your enemies and taking all the credit, you're a failure and should be ashamed for not working harder. Something Seneca will help us come to terms with a million times better than Holiday."

    "Diana, William, and Harry by James Patterson is a very timely book, published soon before the 25th Anniversary of Diana's tragic death in 1997. There are really nice photographs of Diana and Charles at their wedding; William and Harry; and photos of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children; and Harry and Meghan and their children. It begins with the story of Diana's childhood , her wedding to Prince Charles, the births of her sons, her royal tours and work, the marital difficulties, and eventual divorce and separation, and the effects of Charles and Diana's respective television interviews (Charles in 1994 and Diana in 1995). After Diana's death, the author writes about William and Harry as they complete their educations, serve in the military, and espouse some of their mother's causes. The story of William and Harry is told from their births to ca. Summer 2022. Patterson recounts the story based on resources including interviews of Diana, Charles, and their sons, among other sources. Patterson's book is very positive and upbeat, compared to some of the recent books about the royals. There are some quibbles, for instance the Spencer Tiara is passed down the line to the eldest son, it is doubtful Princess Charlotte would inherit it. The current Earl Spencer would need to lend the tiara to a relative for use-- to his daughters and his sons' future wives and to his nieces and nephews. Diana had the Spencer tiara lent to her by Earl John Spencer (her father) to wear at her wedding to Charles. Prince Charles is said to have applauded (according to the author) Charles Spencer's speech about Diana at the funeral; which is doubtful because Charles and Spencer were not getting along that day and Charles had negative feelings about the eulogy and Charles was influential in having Diana's HRH removed in the divorce settlement. I also think there should have been more coverage of Diana's relationship with Dr. Khan; they had a serious relationship and Diana was the one who broke up with him because he did not want to \"go public\" with the relationship. After she died, he told the media he loved her and had tried to contact her late in August 1997. This book is recommended to those interested in the late Princess.",
    "This is a rare nonfiction book from Patterson, with many notes included at the end to cite the information. The book covers the life of Diana Spencer from her teens to her death, and then the lives of her sons up to the present. The typical Patterson short chapters create brief vignettes of the lives of the royals, offering glimpses of what went on, in public and behind the scenes. There is very little, if any, editorializing or criticizing, which is a refreshing change from most writings about the royals. To me, the book offers just enough information to keep me informed.",
    "I love reading everything about the Royals. I just wish the brothers would make up. When all said and done your siblings are the ones you lean on and always know they have your back. I love the relationship they had with their grandparents.",
    "Enjoyed reading about the real-life history of Princess Diana and her sons, as well as their families after her death. Sadly, the Queen passed away while I was reading the last half of the book and a lot of the stories being shown on TV were passages I had just read about. Very interesting reading. Loved this book!",
    "I always enjoy James Patterson's books. I just feel that something ironic happened here. I have many of his books to read as well as other favorite authors. To be reading this one when the Queen passed!?",
    "I didn’t know what to expect since so much has been written about this family over the years. However, there apparently was a lot more to learn. More of a chronological journal which was an interesting approach with tons of footnotes for verification. Not a gossip or fantasy trip. Lots of beautiful photos and behind the scenes back stories. A must read!",
    "If you like the royal family you’ll like this book. I really enjoyed learning more history of these 3. Diana was gone too soon and her sons learned how to lean on each other and carry her legacy. Very easy to read and follow.",
    "Patterson is the best writer and keeps your attention with short chapters.",
    "This book is a sugar coated account of Diana, William & Harry - interesting read & how I hope things happened\nEasy read, I have always been fascinated with Diana hoping for the truth this is what I hope is the truth - still more questions than answers\nI was intrigued with the relationship of mother & her sons\nThe characters of William & Harry with the sadness & burden they have to come to terms with\nI enjoyed this book & glad they had the Queen to ask questions",
    "Great reading and keeps moving a a good pace. Recommend Highly",
    "This book made me cry and smile it is so good\nVery well done"

    "In this book, William MacAskill raises a basic moral question: we don't consider \"this person is not in front of me\" as a reason to disregard people morally. Nor do we consider \"this action will cause harm to people later rather than immediately\" as a good reason to disregard people morally. So why do we basically act as if people far in the future are irrelevant to our moral calculations?\n\nMacAskill takes seriously the possibility that there *won't* be any humans in the future--this is called \"existential risk,\" and there is plenty to worry about (engineered pathogens, nuclear war, AI takeover, climate catastrophe) etc. However, he argues that--if we can survive these existential risks--there's good reason to believe that there will be more humans ahead of us than you can imagine. He points out that if humans last as long as the typical mammal species, 1 million years, then our future as a species (700,000 years) is more than twice our history (300,000). This would lead to 80 trillion future humans, at current population rates. (In contrast, since most of our history as a species was at the low population density of hunter-gathers, only about 100 billion humans have lived so far--the vast majority in the last century.) That means, if we're a typical mammal species, 99.5% of human life-years are ahead of us a species, not behind us. MacAskill asks a simple question: shouldn't we care about these people and the quality of their lives morally?\n\nIt's obvious (to doom-and-gloom people like myself, at least) that humanity could last dramatically shorter than other mammals (I would point out that kangaroos and rabbits don't create nuclear weapons, bioweapons, or AI). But MacAskill points out it's also possible our civilization could last dramatically longer (nor do kangaroos or rabbits have the possibility of colonizing space and spawning multiple civilizations). If we do take to space and last millions of years, the number of human lives ahead of us grows to levels beyond comprehension.\n\nMacAskill's book keeps posing a simple question: shouldn't we care for their well-being? He then provides clear guidance for *how* you can best care for their well-being, after he convinces you that you *should* care.\n\nMacAskill's book is filled with things that you've never thought about, but that seem obvious once he points them out. Have you thought that there might be trillions of humans in the future? I hadn't--and yet he makes this point seem obvious in just a few pages in the Intro.\n\nAnd here's another thing that seems obvious once he says it. With regards to future humans, MacAskill argues:\n\n\"humanity today is like an imprudent teenager: most of our life is ahead of us, and decisions that impact the rest of that life are of colossal importance. But, really, this analogy understates my case. A teenager knows approximately how long she can expect to live. But we do not know humanity’s life expectancy. We are more like a teenager who, for all she knows, might accidentally cause her own death in the next few months but also might live for a thousand years. If you were in such a situation, would you think seriously about the long life that might be ahead of you, or would you ignore it?\"\n\nBasically, MacAskill is asking us to stop acting collectively like teenagers with regard to the potential lifespan ahead of our species. He's asking us to wake up to our future, and grow up.\n\nHe argues that we are at a particular malleable point in history where small shifts could get \"locked in\" and shape the future of trillions of people in the future. He also argues convincingly that large-scale changes are more \"contingent\" than you would imagine--meaning that a relatively small group of people can create massive positive ripple effects that wouldn't have happened otherwise. If this book inspires enough people to rise to the challenge it poses, it's possible that in millions of years, humans will look back and view it as the most important book ever written. There's not too many contemporary books you could say that about plausibly. This is one of them.\n\nThe overwhelming feeling you come away with from reading this book is that your actions today are vastly more important and consequential than you imagined. And that your actions today can have an outsized impact. It's ultimately an empowering book. Who couldn't use a little empowerment right now?\n\nI am a pessimist by nature--I'm currently writing my fourth book, entitled \"Joyful Pessimism\"--so I can't say this book switched me over into wild-eyed optimism for the future. But it made me, a hard-core pessimist, consider that the future might actually be better than I imagined. (It has made me go back and take into account his views in my own book.) Believe me, for this hard-core life-long pessimist, that is very high praise for this book.",
    "\"This book is about longtermism: the idea that positively influencing the longterm future is a key moral priority of our time\". The author starts with three intriguing metaphors: Humanity as an imprudent teenager whose decisions will have lifetime consequences; History as molten glass -- society might set in a fixed unchangeable state; Trying to make the future better as a risky expedition into uncharted terrain. I give the book 5 stars because it is a well written and thought-provoking account of a neglected important topic. Much of the book is eminently sensible, so my comments are just a few counterpoints to a few of the topics discussed, though I have one substantial criticism at the end.\n\nStart with the axiom \"future people count\". This seems unobjectionable, but one then confronts questions like \"is the world better for having more people leading good lives?\" What are the trade-offs between present,near future, and far future costs and benefits? Is a larger population preferable to a smaller population? Chapter 8 discusses such \"population ethics\" questions via thought experiments. This is fascinating as an intellectual exercise, but it is perhaps not surprising that there are no very satisfactory answers.\n\nAnother theme starts with \"values are contingent\" -- for instance, that in an alternate history, large-scale legal slavery might have continued through the 20th Century. The author speculates that the current era of rapid technological and economic growth exhibits unusual \"plasticity\", in the sense that actions or their neglect today might lead to a \"values lock-in\" over the next century or two, so we should attempt to steer in the desired direction today. In particular this is applied to the development of AGIs, though the specific possible consequences described seem unconvincing to me.\n\nChapter 7 worries about possible future \"technological stagnation\"\", and indeed the author writes later \"the risk of technological stagnation alone suffices to make the net longterm effect of having children positive\". This seems curious at first sight, but his point is that the world economy might end in an unsustainable state as regards climate change and resource depletion.\n\nThe final \"What to do\" Chapter 10 contains an interesting analysis, along the lines of the \"effective altruism\" movement that the author has been involved with. Changing personal consumption has little effect, except perhaps for becoming vegetarian. Donating to charities carefully chosen to maximize good, political activism and \"spreading good ideas\" are recommended. Less familiar is the discussion of career choices -- what will be the overall effect of your 80,000 lifetime hours of work?\n\nOn the technical side (my own background is mathematical probability), the use of mathematical expectation (expected significance, expected contingency, expected persistence) in the context of rare events with major consequences is problematical. Especially in the context of trillions of potential future humans, where arguments come perilously close to inane arguments like the Simulation Hypothesis. Similarly, the quoted subjective estimates of probabilities of various catastrophes are very unreliable.\n\nFinally, my only major criticism is that the author does not address the following rather obvious \"elephant in the room\" thought experiment. Imagine an engineered pandemic, designed to and succeeding in killing 95% of humans unselectively without destroying infrastructure. This would be psychologically be harmful to the survivors, but by the logic of longtermism would surely be A Good Thing, in that the subsequent few generations would be free of most of our current worries about climate change, nuclear war, etc, and have time to work toward the ideal future envisaged in this book. But would anyone really say in public that it would be a good act?",
    "The amount of time that went into researching this book astounds me. William and his research team spent over a decade’s worth of full-time work, almost two years of which was spent fact-checking. This is sort of like a blockbuster book. I've also found the ideas presented incredibly engaging and interesting, and even where I ultimately disagree with parts of the author's arguments, I think that there should be no doubt that this book represents an extremely compelling and invigorating point of view which should be receiving much more debate and discussion than it has so far.",
    "The most challenging and thought-provoking book I have read in years. Too early to say for sure, but I hope and expect that it will change my life.",
    "Outstanding. Amazingly well researched and fact checked. A very significant book that may stand the test of time (long into the distant future perhaps).",
    "Author has an engaging writing style and approaches difficult topics in a way that is approachable for a general audience. Overall a great book on the philosophical questions and issues that are going to arise in the future and what we can do about them"

    "This book was not exactly as advertised. I thought it would be more about helping the reader figure out his/her purpose, but it was primarily about the traits and practices of centenarians. I did gain some valuable insights and enjoyed the book, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.",
    "This book is nice.",
    "Not too long and really easy to read, adds a lot of value! Really recommended.\nAlso, made me want to visit Japan as soon as possible ;)",
    "Beautiful words!I bought this for my stepmother, who is Japanese. She appreciated and told me she loves it. I’m glad I found this.",
    "I love the concept of ikigai and enjoyed how the authors used wisdom from various philosophers that I have studied like Victor Frankl and Marcus Aurelius. A good read with some great advice.",
    "The rather exotic sounding name of this book, ikigai, as the authors explain, is relatively straightforward. “This Japanese concept, which translates roughly as “the happiness of always being busy,” is, “like logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond.” Logotherapy, they explain, “…helps people find their purpose in life.”\n\nIt is a good book. My overall rating of the book has little to do with the quality of the writing or the underlying concept. The former is quite good and the latter is valid. My rating is strictly personal and relates more to who might be considering adding it to their reading list. Not a “don’t,” for sure. More like, “understand it for what it is.”\n\nFor those who are ardent fans of all things philosophical and psychological, as I am, this is a good book that plows relatively little new ground. Finding purpose in life, keeping busy, eating well, and finding connection to the world around you is important. It’s ground, however, that has been covered by many authors over the years.\n\nIf you haven’t sampled of these past triumphs you will enjoy this book very much. It is a great and easily read introduction to the topics of longevity and the benefits of living in the moment. And it chronicles many of the philosophies and prior contributions to the topic, from Buddhism to Stoicism, with a stop at the Serenity Prayer. Eastern, and particularly Japanese, contributions are given extra attention. Wabi-sabi and ichi-go ischi-e, for example, are explained in some detail, but remain an overview. Relatively newer concepts like antifragility are also explained. It even covers the Six Healing Sounds introduced by Sun Simiao in the sixth century. (This one was new to me.)\n\nA lot of the book turns on Ogimi, in the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, which holds the distinction of being the oldest village on the planet. (In that many of the residents have lived very long lives.) It’s a delightful visit. Having lived in China for nine years and having visited Japan many times over the course of more than three decades, I have a deep fondness for places like Ogimi. I’m not sure, however, that they aren’t byproducts of the totality of Japanese culture. Could they take seed in places like California or Virginia, for example?\n\nPart of my ikigai is to be a nice person and not think disparagingly of anyone. And I am not here. This book was an interesting read for me, and may be a revelational read for you. I make no judgment on that. I just give you my experience as a reader.\n\nThis book would, in my opinion, make an excellent gift for anyone in your life that might need a little boost or is otherwise hard to buy for. There is absolutely nothing here that could meet with controversy or resistance. It is decidedly upbeat throughout.\n\nAnd that is saying a lot of good things about any book.",
    "We bought this as a gift and they loved the book. They did recommend reading this book.",
    "Loved reading this book. Simple, easy to follow advice for living a happier, healthy life. Easy to follow and an engaging read.",
    "Okay. So, I normally balk at purchasing self help books and try to find some other way of gleaning the often infinitesimally small bit of useful information that they actually impart. Free months on kindle unlimited etc.\n\nIf this book has done one thing, it is to reinforce that rule and remind me not to be so foolish in the future.\n\nFor those of you that are considering buying this book but do not want to waste precious time, sifting through the 95% of this book that is, bulking, waffle, irrelevant, endless repetition of the work Ikigai and theories as to why people on Okinawa live longer than most on the planet....\n\n** There are two things that you need to know.\n\n1. Write down the activities, hobbies, work, that you do, that make you happy (you are half way through the book before they ask you to do this!). Things that not only make you smile and feel fulfilled but where the time passes noticeably more quickly because you are focussed on the enjoyable task at hand.\n\n2. Incorporate those activities as much as you can in your daily life.\n\nThe answers are pretty much in front of you on the Amazon web page for this book. Just take a look at the pictures provided and work it out for yourself from there. It’s not rocket science.\n\nGood luck and live a happy and long life with an extra £10 in your pocket. The Scottish secret to a long marriage and happy wife.\n\nI do not receive any payment or free goods for writing these reviews. I am just happy to share my views on my purchases with fellow like minded Amazonians in the hope that you may find it helpful.",
    "Just read a back of book and its enough dont waste like me😢",
    "The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.\n\nThe book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.\n\nThe chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.\n\nI was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.\n\nThe hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy. Bought it for INR 460 against MRP of INR 499.",
    "The negative reviewers seem to have largely missed the point. Or to have been looking for something they will not find in a book. Yes there are chapters on diet and exercise, and the content of these is not particularly new or surprising (however irritating it may be, these things are indeed features of a healthy lifestyle).\nBut there is a good deal more, including the sense of purpose and meaning that is common to those who have lived to an advanced age. The way this is explored and its links to, for example, logotherapy, are helpful and illuminating. Ikigai offers a genuine recipe for living a meaningful life if you are prepared to give it some time and thought.\nI strongly disagree with the reviewer who wanted it to be much longer! Most books are badly overwritten and in need of editing: the value of a book is in the quality of its content, not the number of pages it fills. This one is attractively presented, says what it needs to, then stops.",
    "I personally believe that having a purpose on in life and then giving it your all is the most important to lead a happy life. This book validates so.\n\nIkigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.\n\nI bought a hardcover because of it’s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.\n\nIf you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you’ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan’s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you’ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.\n\nThe language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it’s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.\n\nComing to the overall feel of the book, it’s very cozy. In it’s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.\n\nI thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read. I was ready to take on my tasks stress-free. Though it is not something extremely crazy and different, it definitely is a one-time read for all the hustlers or non-hustlers out there who think they have to punish themselves to get what they want."

    "What is the novel about? Government authority, religious tolerance, family tradition, individual freedom, social values, economic conditions, the justice system, and environmental concerns. Variables and constants of life for practically any group of people, anywhere in the world.\nWhere does the novel take place? In a modern, war-torn, impoverished nation of simple, independent-minded, family oriented, devoutly religious tradesmen, craftsmen, shopkeepers, and farmers. Specifically, Afghanistan.\nWhat's the big deal? Communists took over the country in 1978. The Russian military invaded. The leaders of the constitutional monarchy fled. Life went on much as before. The military left, about a decade later. Religious extremist factions rose to prominence and proceeded to divide the country. Some religious fanatics gained strength and began to consolidate their influence. The strictly intolerant, fundamentalist Taliban took over the country, having fought and defeated the others. After the attack on the NYC World Trade Center by Muslim terrorists in 2001, the U.S. military arrived in Afghanistan to combat terrorism. They've stayed over 18 years, and counting. They've been fighting the Taliban ever since.\nCurrent status? Not much has changed in the country. The poor people continue to suffer. The quality of life has not improved in the least. There is a total lack of and disregard for civil rights, legal representation, economic development, opportunity for advancement, and fair, impartial justice for all. Ordinary people look on apprehensively as bullets, rockets, and self-destructive bombers dispense justice.\nComplications? Poppy cultivation and narcotics production may be a contributing factor to social unrest in the country and in destabilizing the surrounding region, since Afghanistan is reputed to be a major supplier of heroin to much of the rest of the world. Hitherto unknown individuals, even anonymous groups of rugged-looking, bearded mountain men, may have become exceedingly wealthy and powerful distributing this type of commodity, obtaining weaponry to protect the trade and sowing discord in the process.\nRecommendations? Somebody ought to do something about raising the collective consciousness of the people, even if he only flies kites for health-care awareness, or runs marathons for red-cross disaster relief. There's a lot to be said for a good education, as well, in a nation of illiterates, who can't think for themselves. Other than that, in my opinion, only a continued military presence has any chance of stabilizing the region.\nOdd to think so, but this book review on The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini, published in 2003, could have made a great beginning for a classified CIA report on any number of militant third-world countries they'd better keep a close eye on, in the interest of national security and improving diplomatic relations.\nOn a personal note, the average reader can tell at first glance that the narrator of the story loves his family dearly and has developed life-long, respectful friendships from the time of his early childhood. He's made mistakes, certainly, but he has learned from them. He's grown. He knows right from wrong. He has found his rightful place in the community. He has finally acquired a sense of spirituality. What more should you expect? Forgiveness? A trip to Mecca?\nR. Royce thought about attending a high school football game north of Fort Worth at one of the large magnet schools situated there. A big event, locally speaking. In late August or early September it can be very hot outside, dry or steamy-humid, depending on changing weather conditions, even during the evening of the game. But, he would endure these extremes without complaint, patiently waiting for a cool breeze. It was part of life. One of the things that most impressed him was the energy and enthusiasm displayed by all of the youthful, active participants and spectators in attendance. He'd casually walk over to get a soda at the concession stand and there would be throngs of kids and parents milling about in long lines and in the foyer, chattering happily, cheerfully, excited to be part of the pageantry that has become a proud, Texas tradition.\nHe carried the container of icy-cold drink beverage over to the stands in the stadium-- one which rivals stadiums at the college level in many communities in the states to the north, and took a long look all around him at the players on the field, the marching band, the cheerleaders, the fans in the stands. It was an impressive sight to behold, a glorious event that brought all kinds of people together, from all walks of life. It was a care-free time for relaxation, fun, and frolicking. Music was in the air. Laughter mingled with the sounds of brass instruments and drums. Students and friends and neighbors who hadn't seen one another for the entire summer, since school had been let out, met one another as for the very first time in their lives. It all felt new and different, somehow. Fresh and alive. Splendid and joyful. A carnival of sights and sounds. Popcorn. Syrupy soft drinks. Cotton candy.\nThe best part of all: none of them yet knew his permanent place in society. No one told them this is where you are supposed to sit. This is what you are supposed to do. Nobody told them they had to sit down and be quiet. They were completely free to enjoy themselves, the festivities, and the sporting activities which presented themselves as they presented themselves. It was a good feeling to enjoy complete freedom, even if they didn't realize that's what it was, and a sense of security. They felt confident, bold, gleeful, and beautifully inspired. They would have a bright future before them with incredible challenges and vastly diverse opportunities. This, indeed, was something worth celebrating.\nOf course, by later on in the season, most of them would have found their seats, gone to them, and learned more about the type of acceptable behavior which was expected of them. For now, they all had infinite dignity and infinite possibilities. It was another matter entirely for season-ticket holders.\nThey were the pillars of the community. The founding fathers of the city. The matriarchs of the establishment. People looked up to them, for the most part, and respected them. They mirrored society. If the students represented the future, they represented the present and the past. They were historically significant.\nHis good friend, Cornelius Korn was on the telephone. \"Care to fly to Iceland for the week-end?\" he inquired. \"I found a pilot and guide who's located a rocky outcrop, at the leading edge of a melting glacier, where we can find all the rubies we can possibly carry.\"\n\"All we have to do is go and dig them out,\" said Royce, jubilantly. He'd instantly deduced the truth of the matter.\n\"I think, I'd rather stay at home instead, and skip this trip,\" said Raquel.\n\"What ever shall we do without you boys?\" inquired Alexis Sue.\n\"Pull weeds in the flower garden?\" suggested Korn.\n\"Re-paint the living room?\" Royce offered up. Life goes on.",
    "Let’s face it, when I read Khaled Hosseini’s novel “The Kite Runner”, I simply assumed I was reading historical fiction and that Amir, the main character in the book was the real author. I had to keep looking at the title page to convince myself it wasn't Amir who was writing. If you can achieve that with fiction, I suspect that means you are doing something good. This is certainly the case with Hosseini. And obviously the reading public would agree based on this books success.\n\nTo start at the end, this book closes with the events of September 11, 2001, in which the downing of the World Trade Centers changed our country. In Amir’s case, his closing remarks were about his revelation that Afghanistan has become a household name, to be discussed, of all places, in the most American of our coffee houses, Starbucks. Over the 17 years since it first appeared on the New York Time’s best seller list, it has received major acclaim, and of course the movie also garnered acclaim in 2008. And many US high schools have picked it up in their 11th and 12th grade literature classes, another source of acclaim, although to some extent, any book of great controversial subject matter, stirs the pot of emotions stemming from political correctness, to religiosity, to just plain vanilla helicopter-parent-paternalism. The world has changed, Afghanistan is on the map, and Amir, having reconciled the demon’s of his past, is no closer to solving the problem in front of him. Redemption is only bittersweet.\n\nAt the start, in 1975 when we first meet Amir and his life changes forever, we meet those demons; and we meet Hassan, the kite runner. Hassan is Amir’s best friend. He is also his servant who tends to his every need. Hassan makes his food, cleans his house, irons his clothes and is his constant companion, except in school, where Amir learns to read and write, and Hassan, of a minority group belonging to a lower societal caste, remains illiterate. Growing up in Kabul, Afghanistan, living a life of privilege, in a society that is beginning to falter, the two boys would share their common passion for flying kites. Amir would fly and fight the kite in competition, and Hassan would chase vanquished kites, retrieving them for their victor as a trophy, by outwitting and running those who were also in pursuit. Hassan became the most fabled kite runner in Kabul for his uncanny ability to predict when and where the free flying kite, string cut, would return to earth. Having made many runs through the city, as the story must, during one such run, Hassan experiences the full onslaught of racial violence one group of oppressors could subject on another group. And Amir, helpless as he believes, allows this violence to play out. His demon’s were born. Despite his abysmal cowardice the search for redemption compels you to read further.\n\nThe road to redemption requires the telling of Amir’s story. But in a broader sense, he is telling the recent history of Afghanistan...a truly tumultuous period of time between the fall of the Monarchy and the rise of the Taliban, interspersed with the Russian invasion which made conditions ripe for that seizure of total power in the vacuum. Of course without the Taliban there would have been no 9/11. The US remains in Afghanistan today... although to be topical, President Trump, has just announced another reduction of troops from 4,500 down to 2,500. At the height of the conflict the United States had no less than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. This reduction of 2,000 troops today, by comparison, seems paltry and no doubt political. Lest I head down that same path, I return to The Kite Runner.\n\nBeautifully narrated by Hosseini, having never been to Afghanistan, I feel compelled to one day travel there to see the valleys, smell the air, meet the people, and of course see kites. It is important to note that at the height of the Taliban’s reign of terror, flying kites became illegal. That would be, for our country, the equivalent of banning baseball. Can there be a more innocuous pastime than flying kites? The brutality of the regime cannot be underestimated and simply glimpsed by this erosion of simple freedom. Let alone the long list of other requirements and indicts of Taliban law.\n\nThe Kite Runner is an important book. My daughter read it in high school and basically demanded that I read it too. Not just to learn about life in Afghanistan, but certainly learning deeply about a different culture is a first rate education. But more so for the story of conflict on so many levels. Conflict of class, race, religion, politics, and for course, a conflict of the heart. This story pulls at your heartstrings as aptly as a string moves a kite. I was moved to tears on no less than three occasions.\n\nIn truth, I struggled to read this book in print form, due to Hosseini’s intentional use of cultural names and words for which I stumbled to pronounce. Listening to the audio book, however, allowed me far easier access. After which, when accustomed to the language, the pages were easier to read and Hosseini’s words jumped from the pages. Four stars for this important book.",
    "This book is powerful. It speaks to living fear and not being enough. It teaches about guilt that hangs on like mildew. And the potential truth is obscured by shame.\nYet in a slow and steady manner light and redemption makes its healing process available through unlikely circumstances.",
    "Khaled Hosseini is unquestionably a star in the contemporary literature world; and this masterpiece does true justice to his reputation as a writer who will bring out all the emotion of its readers. As soon as the first page, Hosseini had me captured in his simplistic yet full-of-emotion and complex way of writing. This book serves not only as a passageway to the complex historical and cultural turmoil of Afghanistan; but it provides the reader with a heartbreaking, yet inspiring view of an unlikely bond between two very different persons, of opposite walks of life.\n\nRead it. You'll thank me later.",
    "Wow- what a story! Two lives living side by side in youth but separated by ethnic and social standards. The truth is hidden until it is too late to reconcile. Families torn apart due the continued violence in Afghanistan. Life continues but you never know if everyone is going to heal from past experiences. You don't know if the characters will find peace and happiness.",
    "I served in Kabul, Afghanistan with the British army in 2017, we use to stag on (guard duty) in sangars (guard towers) from which we could see almost all of the city, I saw so much from those towers, sand storms, stray dogs, bomb blasts, the mountains that seemed to be surrounded by higher ones, flares falling from the sky like wings of an angel shot out of NATO helicopters from time to time, the huge Afghan flag on a hill thats name I have forgotten, diving board towers that I thought were ANA sangars at a camp untill I realised they were diving board towers at an old swimming pool, research told me the Taliban used to execute people from them when they took power, the pollution that was on another level, hundreds of people on there way to the mosques to pray when ever the songs played, the list could go on and on and on...\n\nThe one thing I saw as I eyed the sky for Taliban drones was kites, despite everything else that happened there I think it's the one thing I will always remember, they were mesmerising to watch, i had always wondered what kind of a childhood the children flying them would have? how long they would know the innocence of child hood? it's a tough place for a soldier at times let alone a kid, this book I guess answered it for me, it was hard for me to read, I cried and laughed, had to put it down and then come back to it, I will admit I thought it was a memoir right untill the final word.\nTo me Kabul was a sad place, somewhere I would not want to go back too, but I'm a hopefull person and I hope life will get better for the people of Afghan, I know in places and some ways it has.\nThis book is sad, beautiful and honest. It reminded me of the Afghanis I met, the places I went, I could see the streets the author wrote about, the characters too.\nUltimately, It's made me want to continue to be a better person, and its answered some of my questions.\n\"tashakor\", Khaled Hosseini.",
    "This is a story about friendship, sacrifice, love, lies, repentance, tragedy, pain and redemption.\nAmir and Hassan, who lives in Afghanistan were nursed by a same woman as both of them lost their mothers immediately after their birth. As they grew up together in a same home they became inseparable. Hassan was the closest thing to a best friend Amir ever had. But he never accepted that in public as they both belonged to a different community. Hassan was a Hazara boy who belonged to Shi'a community. He was the son of Amir's servant. Whereas Amir was a Pashtun and was the son of one of the most renowned man of the town, a Sunni.\nHassan was a brave and honest boy, a loyal friend and he was the best \"kite runner\" of the town. He was deadly with his slingshot. He was a pure soul and a true friend. Whereas Amir was a coward, mean and an egoistic boy. His head was always buried in books. He had become a good writer and a poet at a very young age. Hassan on the other hand never went to school. Amir used to read Hassan various stories but sometimes he teased Hassan for the words he had never heard of as he was an illiterate. Hassan being innocent and kind never minded that.\nWhen Amir was young he used to long for his father's love. He could go to any length to achieve his father's affection and love which was missing from his life. In the winter of 1975, Amir won the \"Kite fighting tournament\" and won his father's love too. But that happiness didn't last too long as in the same winter a horrible event occured which destroyed everything.\nHassan had always went out of his way to help Amir. Whenever they were in trouble Hassan used to take stand for Amir and always saved him from any ruckus. But when Amir's time came to pay Hassan back for what he had done for him, he backed out. He betrayed his own friend who had always been there for him like his own brother. Amir pretended as if he didn't see anything. Little did he know that thing will haunt him forever and even after 26 years he will not be able to sleep peacefully at night.\nSo this is the story of Amir's search for redemption and peace. That how he returned back to a new but jeopardized Kabul from his comfortable life in America and how he got his peace back somehow but in broken pieces.\nThe devastation of Afghanistan, the abolishment of monarchy, the Russian invasion and then Taliban rule has been described very boldly and is really heartbreaking. This book is not for the light-hearted people at all. This is a tragic story which will leave you sad and heartbroken.\nI have read the other two books of Khaled Hosseini as well. This book is a lot better than \"And the mountains echoed\" but still I like \"A thousand splendid suns\" the best.",
    "\"For you, a thousand times over.\"\n\nThis was the second time I read The Kite Runner and I wasn't disappointed - nope, not at all.\n\nThe Kite Runner is one book that has stayed close with me every time I have read it. I still remember the first time I went through it. It was on a very long train journey. I read it through whatever daylight was available and I ended up crying my heart out. Thanks for me, the second AC compartment had curtains to hide my eyes every time I teared up.\n\nWhat is more is that this book was the first book by Hosseini that I read and I ended up loving it so much that I just had to buy the other two as well. (I still don't have Sea Prayer or a copy of this book but I'm trying to lay my hands on them soon enough. Books like these should end up in my bookshelf.)\n\nNow I know almost everyone has read this book so my review probably won't even matter but I simply cannot not write about it. The Kite Runner was heartbreaking beautiful, heart-wrenching disastrous and a painful tearjerker.\n\nThe book has everything - from rape, war, terrorism to friendship, love and heartbreak. It is also one of the few books that I have read on a tradition that has been forgotten since a long while now - of kite flying and running. I still remember when, as a kid, there was a Muslim family in my neighbourhood. They would be the first ones to fly kite in the winters. It didn't snow like it did in Amir's Afghanistan, but it was a pretty nice day. I remember how I would often look at the boy's kite in awe, for it was the only kite that flew till the very end. And all of them were always so happy. Every year after the game was over, they would invite us over for dinner. We never went, until one day I woke up to find the house empty. It has been years now and till date, I have no clue why they left all of a sudden. Or rather, who sent them away but I remember thinking the reason behind it all. Here was a family, trying to enjoy, trying to create a life and they sent them away.\n\nThe Kite Runner brought back those memories and so many other things. Hassan, for example, broke my heart. Or rather, what happened to him did it. How could he love a man so much despite everything that man had done to him? They moved to America and Amir never even contacted him. That was the least they could do. That was just the....\n\nNo matter how the story ends, I will always know Hassan as the boy who ran, the boy who got betrayed and the boy who was not given what he deserved. And why? All because he was a Hazara? I hate stereotypes and I hate when one culture is undermined for no valid reason. So when Hassan's story was revealed in the end, it did nothing but kill me.\n\nOver and over again.\n\nBut it's alright. Because for you, a thousand times over.",
    "There is a sense reading this book that you are participating in a literary phenomenon. The story essentially relates to the lives of 2 boys Amir and Hassan, growing up in Kabul and told through the eyes of Amir. Amir is the son of a rich man, he is educated, more refined, and most importantly, part of the Sunni ruling class. Hassan is the son of the household servant and is illiterate, more physically robust, and unfortunately for him, part of the Shia lower class. Hassan knows his place and lives a strange existence as Amir’s friend but also his servant.\n\nFollowing an incident where Hassan suffers greatly in protecting Amir, it leaves Amir with an unshakeable sense of guilt and culpability that manifests itself in a resentful disposition towards Hassan. The class system plays its part but the cowardice of Amir will haunt him throughout his life. The writing is really wonderful, how this is portrayed, and so imperceptibly built to capture emotions and our sentiments of injustice.\n\nYears later Amir who has now returned from the US to right some of these wrongs and seeks redemption with Hassan and make amends. Since Amir was last in Afghanistan the Taliban are now in control of the state, society and religion. The writing is so wonderfully paced and descriptive to bring both the emotional horrors and fear of the alien culture he now experiences.\n\nA really superb book on so many levels – the history, religion, social culture, character interaction and it’s ultimately dealing with human emotions of friendship, guilt, selflessness and selfishness. A must read!",
    "“I opened my mouth, almost said something. Almost. The rest of my life might have turned out differently if I had. But I didn’t. I just watched. Paralysed”\n\nFive stars for a stunning book where remorse, guilt, injustice, prejudice, and forgiveness play a significant part in the heart-breaking stories of Amir, son of Baba, and Hassan, son of Rahim Aga, a loyal friend and servant to the Amir’s father, set against the backdrop of some of Afghanistan’s most turbulent years.\n\n'The Kite Runner' is an unforgettable story about two young boys whose lives are shaped by the regrettable decisions taken, inaction and cowardice that strains their relationship and ultimately tears them apart. It is also a story that signifies the power of voice and the devastating consequences of not using it when the time and cause requires it. Yet is also a tender story that demonstrates forgiveness, the power of love, and the importance of confronting the lies and injustices around us. A truly sensational story that is told with sentiment, honesty and with a powerful message.\n\nThe Plot\n\nAmir and Hassan are friends, Amir “..was a Pashtun and Hassan was a Hazara, Amir was Sunni and he was Shi’a, and nothing was ever going to change that” However, the two boys shared a love of kite flying and won competitions and Hassan the title of best ‘Kite Runner’. Yet the two boys could not deny their racial differences as Hassan was forced to sit on the side lines while Amir played with other Sunni friends. Behind closed doors and away from probing eyes they were devoted friends until an evil act of depravity charts the boys on different courses.\n\nAs Amir struggles to forgive himself for inaction and cowardice, he recalls “.. I had one last chance to make a decision. One. In the end, I ran. I ran because I was a coward”\n\nThe story continues along two different paths until Amir, despite his successes in America, is forced to confront the ugly past with a twist that he could predict as the secrets hidden from him are revealed.\n\nReview and Comments\n\nA heart felt and touching story that shines a light on the injustices, suffering, and racial disparities felt across the world, without being judgemental. A story that needed to be told and a book that should be read. However, it was the forgiveness in the book that pulled on my heart strings just as much.\n\nI love books that deliver strong messages but don’t lecture or patronise or seek to influence the reader politically or socially. It is up to the reader to take from these stories what they will and shape their own opinions. Yet they do help us understand different perspectives, the hardship of people displaced and suffering that comes with unrest and for that reason I adored ‘The Kite Runner’.\n\nThe writing style is superb, and I particularly loved the words and teachings of the wise men, and there is no shortage of them in this narrative. One of my standout quotes from this beautiful book is\n“…there is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. Do you understand that?” …. “When you kill a man, you steal a life,” Baba said. “You steal his wife’s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. Do you see?”\n\nSad, powerful, and poignant, yet beautiful and tender in parts as the power of voice reminds us of when we should use it. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. Sensational."

    "She brings and honest and needed fresh perspective on the intricate dynamics between parents. Great examples and research. Definitely recommend this book",
    "Bought this book because I seen it on instagram, so far both me and my husband are loving it. Even if you can’t directly relate to it it’s a great insight into balancing a relationship",
    "I'm not a Reese Witherspoon book club member. I'm a working mother and wife (I found Fair Play through a recent finance podcast). Two years ago I hit a similar breaking point to the author's \"blueberry meltdown.\" After 13.5 years of marriage, to a man willing to share the work, I woke up and realized he was treating me like a doormat - I'll spare you the details.\n\nI tried and tried strategies to improve my situation. After a few failed mini-efforts (including trading lives for a week to promote empathy), we finally landed on a system that is extremely similar to the cards recommended in Fair Play (we use assignable to-do lists in the Wunderlist App). Every strategy in the Fair Play system is part of our own. We’ve needed it all — the dredging of work from the shadows to the light, the value setting, the ownership from conception to execution, the avoiding using your spouse as back-up for everything, and even the built-in time-off for self-development. We hit bumps. I worried what my in-laws thought — but we stayed the course.\n\nIt worked, and we are better than ever (and, yes, that means more and better sex, too). The system freed us not only from the nit-picky day-to-day misery but also from the feeling we could never leave the house. We found free-time. My husband revels in the friendships and activities he can leave his family for, guilt-free. I traveled for 10 days of business last March (with manageable preparations for my “cards”), and all they missed were hugs.\n\nThe first 100 or so pages of this book set the context for the issues women (largely) are facing. This is the context I lived. It's definitely a downer. I say this to say, that if you need a ‘why' to get yourself moving on this Fair Play plan, then read it. But if you can buy into the plan without it — SKIP it (for now). For husbands/back-up partners: It's hard to stare a problem like this in its face, and still have the energy to do the work. Do the work for your family. Do the work for your daughters (and sons). Do the work for yourself. There are so many issues in life that we can not control: This is one we can.\n\nFair Play will lift women's spirits. Fair Play will make them feel loved. Fair Play will give them back their energy and joy — and they, in turn, will bring their true gifts to you and the world. It is truly one area where you can take a small step for a woman, and a giant leap for MAN- and WOMAN-KIND. (I’m only sorry I can not go back in time and take some cards for my mother.) For what it's worth, it's not men's fault. We are all working hard. Through discussion, we raise our shared-expectations. For some partners in a family it will feel like more work in total. Early in the process, old resentments can sometimes target the system, making things worse. But, if you can get to a place where both partners sincerely try, you will be busier AND happier. TODAY.\n\nIf you choose to play, the time you spend on Fair Play tasks (the grind; emotional labor, etc.) will be what allows you, on your death bed, to look back and say, \"I’m glad I was there for my family.\"",
    "Let me start off by saying that today's book is one that many not be popular in many Christian circles. Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live) by Eve Rodsky is not a \"Christian\" book. In fact a lot of people would probably deem it a feminist text and move on. But, before I jump into that, lets talk about what this book is.\n\nFair Play is an acknowledgement that in most marriages the majority of work inside the home falls primarily on the shoulders of women. In fact, modern women are being CRUSHED by the weight of everything that they are rightly and unjustly expected to do for their families.\n\nFair play is a system that helps couples to balance out the work load. The best part about this book is that Rodsky says clearly how to do that. In a lot of marriage books this idea is summed up as, \"have a conversation with your spouse about responsibilities\" and then they move on. This book IS the conversation you need to have with your spouse, it is also the conversation on how to make the changes needed.\n\nI will say that when my husband and I used this system we had to add in categories because we are a military family and we homeschool. Both of those qualifiers have specific needs and requirements that this book just didn't cover.\n\nNow, as to the idea that this book is unbiblical... if you have read the Bible, sharing one another's burdens and having dominion over your sphere of influence is not a male/female thing. It is a Christian thing. There isn't anything in the Bible that says a man can't help with household chores. The word of God places a great deal of significance on treating one another with respect and a great many Christian marriages could use this book to help get out of some ugly, un-Christlike patterns.\n\nOverall, I give Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live) five stars. I have come back to this book often and I have already loaned it to a friend. While it isn't a Christian book, there isn't anything in the text that compromises my theological standard.",
    "Who among us working moms has not felt the pure rage that arises when we've worked a full day at the office but also made the orthodontist appointments, looked into summer camps, put \"find a new math tutor\" on the list, got up at 5 to do the laundry, prepped dinner, cleaned up after breakfast, thought about school application deadlines for the following year, gave the cat his medicine--basically pulled a full-on Alice from The Brady Bunch--while our partner MAYBE drives a kid to practice a couple days a week or loads the dishwasher and then expects a medal plus a TV news crew to come cover it? I want to scream just thinking about this situation that used to be mine. BUT then I read this book and I'm happy to report -- Eve Rodsky has our back! This book saves marriages, sanely. Most partners actually want to be involved 50/50 and FAIR PLAY shows exactly how to do that. Step by actionable step, backed by research and real-life examples. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.",
    "Very interesting and I’d love to see her book and game for parents and teens and young adults at home and how to divide responsibilities! Looking forward to reading Unicorn Space now!",
    "This is a great book, so much work has been put into it. I found it to be very fair for both sides and would recommend to any couple. I have bought 3 as wedding gifts with the cards. The author has thought of most everything and I even found myself saying \"I didn't know I got to count that as work\" because yes buying birthday gifts, wrapping and getting kids to parties is a lot of work!!",
    "We are a professional working couple with 2 under 4 and I saw this book recommended and I thought it would be a good idea to re balance the work load as I was constantly overwhelmed. It’s only really good if your partner doesn’t do much at all in the house and is extremely reflective and on board for change. I also feel like it was a bit derogatory towards men, it also didn’t account for same sex couples. In my experience sharing this with friends the man has never responded well to the book (which is an issue in itself.) There is no doubt there is a terrible divide in jobs in most households, with women doing so much more (typically) however this doesn’t really solve the problem. Treating your husband like a child doesn’t really work in my opinion. Save yourself some money and just divide jobs in the house. However I think there is great advice is about what the author explains is CPE which means if you’re responsible for a job then you have to conceive the idea, plan it and then execute it. I think that really helps the overwhelm but apart from that, not a good balanced book for couples who are looking for help.",
    "The book constantly assumes you're a woman and sometimes seems more focused on talking about how husbands are useless rather than the actual advice.\n\nIt's weird since in the first chapter she goes about saying how she thinks this will help all kinds of families and co-parents, but then goes through the rest of the book ignoring anything other than a heteronormative dysfunctional couple.\n\nThe method and advice is AMAZING though, so if you can get past the previous stuff, it's really worth the read.",
    "The tips in this book and method suggested are excellent. I just wish it wasn’t so strongly geared towards women - mostly who are the stay at home or primary parent. I don’t like the way the author degrades the male partner in many of her passive aggressive comments. If I gave this book to my husband to read he would really take offence to that and it would turn him off the idea. I wish they would just generalize this book more so the partner who isn’t pulling their weight is not always the man. Would appeal to an even larger audience and same sex couples as well. No need to put down men as a general whole to make the excellent suggestions this book provides.",
    "I really enjoyed this book. I find the idea of turning the management of the household into a game that you both win very interesting. It can be a bit repetitive at times but still a very good read",
    "4 wave intersectionality at its worst. Seems intent on telling you how the natural power dynamics of the oppressive man make you the victim.\n\nLazy writing, lazy arguments, childish mindset. Returning."

    "4.5 stars\n\nAt age 36, in the last year of his neurosurgery residency, Paul Kalanithi discovered he had stage IV lung cancer. For the next 22 months, he and his wife Lucy, an internal medicine physician, awoke each day focused on living, not “living until...” When Breath Becomes Air was written largely because Dr. Kalanithi had the soul of a poet and turning to words to express any experience in life was as instinctive to him as breathing itself. His intent was that his story could aid in the healing of others and that one day his own daughter would read it and get a sense of the father she would never remember.\n\nThe book’s format, like the author’s writing style, is simple, straightforward, eloquent, and unflinchingly honest – Prologue, Part I and Part II. In the prologue, Paul describes the first step in his diagnosis, getting x-rays for his recurring severe chest pain. It was 15 months prior to the end of his residency. He could see the light at the end of the long 10-year tunnel of preparation for his work in neurosurgery. There would be wonderful opportunities to practice as well as conduct research, offer of a professorship, a huge increase in income, a new home and starting a family with Lucy. The x-rays were fine, he was told. But he had lost weight and the pain was not letting up in severity. He began researching incidence of cancer in his age group. Things with Lucy were strained at that time, partly because he was not sharing his concerns about his condition. She decided against going with him on a vacation with old friends in order to sort out her own feelings about their relationship. He came home in severe pain after just a couple of days. She picked him up from the airport. After he told her about his symptoms and his self-diagnosis, she took him to the hospital that night where a neurosurgeon friend admitted him.\n\nMost of Part 1, In Perfect Health I Begin, describes life prior to the diagnosis, obviously back to his childhood. Both of his parents were immigrants from India, his father a Christian and his mother Hindu. Both families disowned them for many years. They moved their own family of three sons from Bronxville, New York to Kingman so Paul’s father could establish a cardiology practice, which he did very successfully. Paul’s mother had been trained as a physiologist in India before eloping with Paul’s father when she was 23. Her own father had defied the traditions of 1960s rural India and insisted that his daughter be educated and trained for a profession. She was horrified to discover that Kingman’s school district was among the lowest performing in the entire country. Her eldest son had been educated in Westchester County, New York schools, where graduates were assured of admission to the nation’s most prestigious universities. He had been accepted at Stanford before the move to Kingman. What would happen to 10-year-old Paul and his 6-year-old brother Jeevan? Instead of wringing her hands, Mrs. Kalanithi threw herself into supplementing her sons’ educations and improving that of all the children in the area. She gave Paul a reading list intended for college prep students and at age ten he read 1984, followed by many other modern and traditional classics. He discovered a love for words as an expression of the human spirit. His mom got elected to the school board and worked with teachers and others to transform the school district. After a few years their 30+% dropout rate was greatly reduced and graduates were getting accepted at universities of their choice.\n\nNo doubt Paul was born with that poetic soul, but it was his mother’s guidance that led him to read the literary giants who nourished that soul. It was his parents’ examples of excellence in their own lives, their faith, and service to their community, in this strange land that they made their own, that formed Paul’s desire and need to serve.\n\nIn When Breath Becomes Air, he writes of vocation, a term you rarely hear people use these days. A thousand years ago when I was growing up, vocation was ubiquitous. We were told time and again that discerning our vocation was one of our prime responsibilities as human beings. It was our reason for being here, what we were called to do in service to humankind. Teaching, medicine, religious ministry, musicianship, military, etc. By knowing our natural talents we could know our vocation.\n\nPaul had many talents and interests, complicating his vocation decision. He studied both English literature and human biology in college. “I still felt literature provided the best account of the life of the mind, while neuroscience laid down the most elegant rules of the brain.” Also a man of deep spirituality, Paul reflected, “Literature not only illuminated another’s experience, it provided, I believed, the richest material for moral reflection. My brief forays into the formal ethics of analytic philosophy felt dry as a bone, missing the messiness and weight of real human life.” The intersection of science and morality was of prime interest to Paul.\n\nThe rest of Part I describes how Paul came to see medicine and then neurosurgery as his vocation. He forthrightly deals with the idealism of medical students and residents and how that idealism is dimmed or completely snuffed out by the realities of giving medical care to other human beings. His explanation of cadaver dissection and why physicians and their families do not donate their own bodies to medical science is eye opening. “Cadaver dissection epitomizes, for many, the transformation of the somber, respectful student into the callous, arrogant doctor.” This is the kind of honesty displayed throughout the entire book. He writes of his own loss of idealism and how the recognition of that affected his own self-image as well as his job performance. “I wondered if, in my brief time as a physician, I had made more moral slides than strides.”\n\nThat earlier mentioned phrase, “the messiness and weight of real human life” describes this book. The author has given the world not a mere recollection of events or achievements, but has laid bare his soul, exposing the very marrow of his being. This book should be read by every premed student in the world before they commit to a decade or more of study and relentless hard work.\n\nIn Part II , Cease Not till Death, the author details the diagnosis, the immediate aftermath, the determination to emphasize living not dying, the quest to conceive a child, and the agony involved in treatment. I think Part II should be experienced by each reader. Most readers will find it extremely compelling and very personal. It is the nitty gritty of this man’s inner being. Lucy, his wife, wrote an eloquent epilogue further detailing Paul’s experience while writing this book, the support they received from colleagues, friends, family, and others after his death on March 9, 2015.\n\nI found this book soul wrenching, but also witty, uplifting and hopeful. Without preaching, he reveals some deep flaws in the way we do health care and the price that not just patients but the care providers sometimes pay. In our war with cancer, it won a battle here by taking this remarkable man so early. He would have touched hundreds of students and thousands of patients with the professorship that would have been his. But When Breath Becomes Air is sure to touch millions of us. Cady Kalanithi will one day be able to read for herself just who her father really was.\n\nRating: 4.50/5.0.",
    "Paul Kalanithi began to read books at a very young age, and he has always wanted to someday write his own book. In fact that was what led him to study English literature for his BA and MA in Stanford. But life had a different plan for him, as after two more impressive degrees he found himself in Yale Medical School, dealing directly face to face with life and death in his 7 years of residency.\n\nThis book is the culmination of his 2 loves, literature and medicine, where he eventually gets to write a beautifully written memoir about his experience as a top notch neurosurgeon who abruptly turned into a patient himself after he was diagnosed with a stage IV metastatic lung cancer.\n\nIndeed, this book has a sad ending, as it is published posthumously a year after he passed away. But this isn’t a spoiler because the main point of the book is not about the ending (we’re all going to die eventually), but it’s about the journey, about hopes and dreams as a medical student, all the sleepless on-calls, the emergency room drama, the extraordinary hard work to become a neurosurgeon, the life-changing split-second decision makings in the operation room, and finally about dealing with illness and mortality along with his deteriorating health condition, the 5 stages of grief, the in and out of therapy, and the emotional toll on the family and close friends.\n\nAnd somewhere between his face-to-face encounter with death as a doctor and patient lies a space and time where Kalanithi ponders about the meaning of life, and he learned them one lesson at a time in the hospital, where births meet deaths meet every disaster, hope, loss, recovery, and the mess in between, and the zen clarity of a wisdom that can only be obtained by someone who is dying but have accepted their fate.\n\nAll of these are written in a first-person vantage point that brings us the reader into his shoes, as if we’re the ones who are living it. And it was all so very moving and inspiring. The last chapter in particular almost reduced me to tears. Incredible, incredible book.",
    "An interesting book. A very well-written book. A thought-provoking book. But it was clearly a difficult set of circumstances to have been writing about. Regardless, this book was an eyes-wide-open view of what the future held in store for the author. That the author could write about his past -- and of his pending highly-abbreviated future -- with such clarity and purpose was amazing.\n\nThe book’s structure was unusual, consisting of only four chapters. The first chapter is a fairly short prologue introducing the reader to the author’s life-altering circumstances. The second chapter covered the author’s life up to the point his cancer diagnosis was confirmed; and the third chapter covered the remainder of his life, post-diagnosis. The short fourth chapter was written by the author’s wife after his death, and reflected on their life and of the “journey” they took together.\n\nBottom line: Powerful writing. Powerful story of living a life while knowing that that life will be cut tragically short.",
    "When I first finished this book, I was ready to award it only 3 stars.\n\nI had absolutely loved Part 1. Everything Paul talked about enthralled me. His love for literature, his constant philosophical questioning as to what made life meaningful, his insights into the paradoxes of studying life to understand it vs experiencing it and building the relationships that gave it meaning, and his drive and fascination with biology and specifically neurology. He felt so alive in Part 1 as I read, his drive, his yearning to master this thing called life, his success mindset, I loved him. I felt so sad that he was dead and that I would never get to meet him. What a loss to the world. And it seemed so horribly unfair that a man who did so much to save the lives of others, should be deprived of life himself. Horribly unfair. Was that how we got rewarded in life for good deeds?\n\nI gave myself a break before Part 2. A breather because I knew it was going to get heavy. Paul hadn't survived despite the upbeat voice of Part I. He had died. Others had warned me this was a book that would leave me in torrents of tears, so I gave myself some time to prepare for the emotional upheaval and brace myself.\n\nYet during that break, something nagged at me. A small voice at the back of my head told me something didn't sit quite right. Paul seemed too brilliant from the first part. Was that how he really was? Maybe he was saying some of things that so impressed me, because they came to light after he knew he was facing death. Maybe he was making himself sound better than he was...?\n\nI made the mistake of googling the book so I could read some more about him. It was odd, I wasn't ready to face Part 2 yet, but I still wanted to stay connected to Paul and the book, so I found myself reading about him and his wife on the internet.\n\nI discovered they'd had a baby! That shocked me. Why would he have a child when he knew he wasn't going to be around to bring it up?\n\nAnd I read about his wife finding new love a couple of years after his death. Ironically, with a widower whose dead wife had also written and had a memoir published about her impending death.\n\nI know it's totally wrong of me to feel this and judge, but I felt cross with her. I was still at the part in the book where Paul was alive, and here she was already with someone else. I lost love for her and my opinion of her became a little jaded. (I know, totally dumb and unfair. What can I say...)\n\nWhen I finally got back to Part 2 then, I was already in lower spirits, but not because I knew Paul was going to die. Because I felt lost and didn't understand the decisions that he or his wife were making. I started to feel cross with him for having a baby when we wouldn't be there for her as she grew up. And when he returned to work full gusto after the first successful treatment, I was beyond flabbergasted. How could he do that. Knowing how ill he'd been? In fact, worse, how could he ignore all the pain that was returning and just use painkillers to mask it and go on? Why? Why would he do that? Why would anyone do that?\n\nIn my vanity and arrogance, I was so mad with Paul. He'd had a chance to live and he'd thrown it away in my opinion. He'd gone back to a job that had killed him. That's what it felt like for me.\n\nAnd that oncologist! Why did she keep pushing him back to such a stressful unhealthy job?! There was no way in the world that a personality like Paul was going to go back to it part-time. A return to it was always going to almost certainly put critical strain on his body.\n\nAnd emulating her question, he kept asking several times in the book, what do you value? What gives your life meaning?\n\nExcept, he never explicitly answered. In my arrogance, I judged the meaning of his actions and assumed that they revealed what gave him meaning: his job, achievement, becoming a high-flying consultant who was respected and adored by all.\n\nI thought he was selfish. His marriage was on the rocks before his diagnosis, precisely because they weren't spending time together (my assumption) and there he was, having been given another chance, and he returned to the same crazy lifestyle. He valued success. He didn't value relationships or other people.\n\nThat was my original opinion. Harsh, judgmental and assuming.\n\nIt took a whole evening of discussion at Bookclub to really unlock this book and Paul Kalanithi's last days for me, and turn my opinion completely around. One of the members asked repeatedly, why did we think Paul wrote the book?\n\nWe didn't come to a common consensus right away. I felt he had wanted to leave a legacy. For selfish reasons. But others thought that the book was a way of him coming to terms with what was happening to him.\n\nI now think that this is true, the book did give him opportunity to try to make some sense of his life and his impending early death. I think that anyone facing an early demise would find themselves trying to understand what was the point of it all.\n\nI think he did also want to leave a legacy, but not truly for selfish reasons. Literature was a passion of his and he had always wanted to write. It was a dream, an ambition and he wanted to fulfil it before he died. There's even something noble in this. To leave something of value behind for others so that they might benefit from his sorrow and suffering.\n\nWhen we noted that Paul never explicitly answered what he valued and what made his life meaningful, we considered that maybe he didn't actually know the answer to that question. And there was a searching for it in the book as he wrote it to some extent.\n\nSomeone noted that he'd repeatedly asked and needed to know, how long did he have? Because how long he had would impact how he chose to spend his remaining time. Did he have time to finish his training and graduate? Or was it less? If it was less, he would write his book. The same dilemma appeared again and again.\n\nAnd he noted finally at one stage, the irony of his position. Before his diagnosis, he hadn't known how long he'd got left. And after, he hadn't known how long he'd got left.\n\nMy friends helped me to realise that Paul was a man that was really struggling even though he doesn't express it in emotional terms through his writing. What a horrible position to find yourself in. You've got cancer, you're definitely going to die. What do you do with your remaining days? What would you do?\n\nFor Paul, it made sense if he had more time to go back to work and complete the training he had invested virtually his whole life in. He was so close to the finish line. So close. It made sense to just go back and finish it and maybe even reclaim the future he had worked so hard and relentlessly to attain.\n\nWhen the returning cancer started to make itself known through the excruciating back pains he started to experience again, he dumbed it down, ignored it, buried his head in the sand a little, or more accurately perhaps, stayed laser-focused on his goal. You don't become a neurosurgeon by being swayed or distracted by obstacles when they appear. That was not his way, and I can only assume that he was helpless to change this in himself.\n\nI realised that for all the good that Paul Kalanithi did for others, how many lives he saved and how many people he redirected on the road back to health and self-care, ultimately he did not do the same for himself.\n\nDid he realise this? That he had failed in his own self-care? He makes a point midway through Part 1 how some students had rallied to try and change the Hippocratic Oath equivalent that they were to swear to in the US, caveating that they should not put their own welfare behind their patients. Of course this was meant in a different context, but the irony strikes me hard in the face. I wish fervently that Paul Kalanithi had cared more about his own health and well-being, maybe then, maybe, he might even be here still to save more lives and see his wife smile and his little girl grow up.\n\nOf course death comes to us all. It is our final master. The curtain that gives our performance meaning ultimately. And yet what I learnt from this book is that having Focus without Balance is a fatal mistake. Fatal to all projects, but in this case it feels like it may have been a key factor that claimed a life.\n\nIf Paul had not been so single-mindedly driven, would he have spotted those shadows in the scans before they became irreversible? Would he have chosen to make better choices about his hours (punishing 5am starts and such late finishes it was all he could do to collapse), about the food that he ate (a quick lunch of an ice-cream sandwich and coke was never going to be conducive to promoting good health in the body), about the emotions that he felt (there was such a desperate need/requirement to perform unreasonably consistently at an exceptionally high level for him)...\n\nI feel so sad for Paul now. This was a man who struggled desperately to do the right thing in the only way he was taught to and the only way he knew how. But he was not rewarded for it ultimately.\n\nI think now, that what Paul maybe valued most of all, was maybe trifold - relationships in conjunction with giving value to others and achievement. When he returned to neurosurgery and he was only doing the surgeries, he had said that the job had started to feel empty and he’d stopped enjoying it. And that it was only when he returned to consulting with patients that it became meaningful again.\n\nAnd at the very end of the book, his final letter to his daughter, he tells her that when she questions if her life has had meaning, to know that she gave a dying man joy such that all his desires were sated. Finally in death, he had stopped the chasing that had been set up in his childhood and persisted in this crazy world we live in permeating a job that he loved and had tremendous value. Finally he found value and found himself being valued by a child who was till a baby and asked nothing of him other than to love and adore him and be loved and adored back in return. No chasing, nothing about his past or his future, all she wanted and needed from him was his attention now, here, in the present.\n\nI've realised that this book was actually his real gift to his daughter. In it she can learn everything that her father was, what he stood for and believed in, what he loved and what he struggled with. Within the pages if she looks closely enough, she will find a guiding compass as to what kind of questions to ask yourself in life so you can be proactive in making your life meaningful and valuable.\n\nFor me, Paul and our bookclub members have given me an immeasurable gift. I have realised that like Paul, I myself need to more actively prioritise my health. Maybe that is why I was so mad with Paul, because he did what I do myself so regularly. Sacrifice longevity for quick wins in the scheme of things.\n\nAnd perhaps equally importantly, I've recalled that none of us know how long we have truly. And that if we live our life without prioritising what's really the most important thing in the world for us, regardless of how long we have left, then we can only win ultimately. We must find a way to balance the scenario where we might live for several decades more and yet today might be our last day too.\n\nI think this is actually possible and achievable. But it requires us to stop and take a step back every now and then, so that we look deeply into how we our lives now. And consider what it would be like if everything was to phase out to black in the next moments, as death stole us away. What would be the urgent need in these final moments?\n\nPaul's sweet wife, Lucy, says in the afterword that Paul's hope was that the book might prompt readers to walk in his shoes a moment and feel what it's like to facing a difficulty such as his, before stepping out of them again. It's definitely done this for me. What a tremendous profound gift.\n\nI don't know what the book might have been if Paul had had an opportunity to complete it. But I feel that paradoxically, not achieving completion was his greatest achievement of all. He perfectly demonstrates the future that awaits us all, and gives a profoundly valuable opportunity to breathe more life into our remaining days and years as a result.",
    "‘At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet’, it is said. But one cannot say the same about Death. When Death arrives calling, not everyone stays brave or becomes a philosopher. Not all of us remain the proud humans that we are during our lifetimes, but go begging for another lease of life, no matter however brief that might be. Very few of us have the courage and composure to meet Death face-to-face, contemplate their life so far, take stock of their purpose and progress, and then, finally, do something that would fill them with the satisfaction of leaving behind something worthwhile, something that could set apart their sojourn on this planet from the billions of others. Paul Kalanithi’s was, fortunately or unfortunately, one such life that acquired a glowing purpose and meaning, sadly more during his final phase of life.\n\nPaul Kalanithi was the second of three sons of an Indian couple settled in America. He had everything going for him. A comfortable life with family, marrying the love of his life, pursuing a career as special and as advanced as neurosurgery, reputation that could have landed him a plump career as soon as his training ended. But he also had something else too – lung cancer of an advanced stage. All his plans for the future suddenly vanished like mirage. With a life now cut short due to illness, Paul launched deeply into questions of existential nature, questions he had felt even while he was riding the crest of the tide.\n\nThis book is the answer to his questions about the meaning and purpose of human life. And, what an eloquent and poetic answer this has turned out to be! Published posthumously, this memoir recounts Paul’s early life in detail, telling us about what led to his decision to pursue a career in neuroscience, his early days as a resident surgeon and his ascent to glory. Then come the details of his illness, the various stages of cure that were tried and his frantic, determined quest to find the meaning for his life, whatever little was left of it. His wife Lucy’s epilogue is as fitting an end to the book as it could have been – beautiful, full of love and written more in a matter of fact manner than in a mawkish tone, just the same way in which Paul had written the whole book.\n\nLife is a continuum and Death is a part of it, whether we like it or not. Death is in fact the only absolute certainty in the lives of everything, from the tiny sapling to the mightiest of stars. Just like the eyes ignore the nose that is in front of them, in order to give us an unhindered view of the world, our minds push that ineluctable reality behind so that we can plot our plans for decades until, of course, Death arrives calling, putting to waste our best-laid plans. The more we contemplate the meaning of our lives, the more we acknowledge what awaits us all in the end, and the more we chart the course of our lives accordingly, the easier it becomes for us to leave our mortal shells behind with dignity. Just the way Paul did.\n\nGoing through the book, I was often reminded of Viktor Frankl’s ‘Meaning Triangle’. According to him, a human being can add meaning to his/her life in one of these three ways – by creating something beautiful – a work of art, literature or something else similar, by being a beacon of love, filling the lives of others with love and joyful experiences or, finally, by showing a courageous attitude towards the travails that Life places on one’s path. According to me, Paul has done all the three and has really added a glowing meaning to his beautiful life, no matter however short it had been.\n\nDone reading, I am leaving this book on my shelf, nestled between Viktor Frankl’s magnum opus ‘Man’s Search for Meaning’ and Anne Frank’s ‘The Diary of A Young Girl’, because I really feel that this book deserves its place up there!",
    "I came across this book when I was wandering in a book shop - I thought it looked interesting and I bought it, THANKFULLY! I read it twice this weekend, once, the paperback, then I downloaded it from Amazon to my Kindle (or did I upload it?) so that I could highlight parts of it and I re-read it.\n\nIt's a 'must read', inspiring - LIFE CHANGING - book. Paul, it seems to me, was a genius but he wasn't a distant, aloof intellectual - he was a kind, gentle, giving, empathetic person. Humanity is all the poorer now that he has passed away but thanks to and via the legacy of his beautiful writing, his teachings, his lessons, he will continue to inspire and comfort all who come across his giant footprint.\n\nI'm now an unofficial, self-appointed ambassador/promoter of this book and the words and teachings of Paul Kalanithi.",
    "This is a book which you cannot forget about after reading. Initially, I was a little reticent about reading it, due to the subject matter, but after many personal recommendations and assurances it was not all 'doom and gloom,' I gave it a go. I'm glad I did.\nPaul Kalanithi was a brilliant brain surgeon when he was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer, which despite treatment, continued to spread and ultimately caused his premature death. Paul was also a brilliant and very gifted writer, who, in his long terms plans prior to a diagnosis was going to spend twenty years of his life post-medical career, dedicated to writing. His ability to write shines through in this book. He uses language beautifully and has an almost poetic turn of phrase while remaining brutally honest to the situation he is facing.\nIronically, I found this book to be more about life than death. Paul talks about his journey into medicine and the privilege of being allowed to change the course of a person's life through surgery. His own cancer journey is shown as something he deals with rather than being ruled by. He continues to work and plans to start a family with his wife, Lucy. He charts the difficult transition he needs to make from being the doctor to being the patient and how he is not always successful in doing this.",
    "there's one phrase i love the best in this book:\n\nNo philosopher can explain the sublime better than this, standing between day and night. It was as if this were the moment God said, “Let there be light!” You could not help but feel your specklike existence against the immensity of the mountain, the earth, the universe, and yet still feel your own two feet on the talus, reaffirming your presence amid the grandeur.”\n― Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air\n\nHe really writes very well.."

    "Time is not something we manage or use wisely. Time is us. A sequence of moments comprises us. We can never master time or hope to be so efficient we get everything done because we have an inherently limited time on Earth. Anything we can hope to accomplish will, by definition, be insignificant compared to the eternal moments of the Universe. We will never have enough time to do everything we need or want to. That fantasy is humanity's hubris and it hinders us from truly living. Living as if there is some future where we will be perfectly in control of our limited time is delusional. This book helped me to see how to do the next most important thing. Thank you.",
    "I heard Oliver Burkeman on a podcast talking about this book. (Turns out he's been on many!) The message resonates with me so deeply - that there's only so much time in our lives. There's an opportunity to be more willing to be pro-active AND let go of perfectionism. There are things I will get done and there are things I won't get done. The more willing I am to surrender to that fact, perhaps, the easier my life will go / feel. Every \"system\" of getting things done seems to suggest that we can do it all, when we can't. I'm working on acceptance of that. And this book is a profound help. Now I'm on Burkeman's newsletter and really soaking in his reflections about life and death and limitations. I want to live fully in the time I have. This book is a meditation on that.",

    "Interesting in so many ways. I found myself often pausing just to digest the implications. Well researched and put together.",
    "In a world saturated with endless self-help books, Burkeman’s Four Thousand Weeks is not your average self-help book. There are no lists to make or color code; there are no empty platitudes about finding the strength to be your best self, productive, accomplished and in control of your time and life. No, Burkeman tells us that we are only here for 4,000 weeks if we’re lucky enough, so we better stop trying to strive to be this idealized version of ourselves who is on top of everything. It’s impossible. We need to get over it.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about this book was the blunt manner in which I was told to relinquish the unending desire to master my time. Life is unpredictable. There will never be enough time to do everything and if we keep thinking that once we get our act together and get organized, things will finally be fine. This mindset takes us away from the beauty of life’s spontaneity, the joy of relationships, and keeps us in a perpetual state of reaching toward an elusive goal that never gets accomplished. The bottom line is that life is unpredictable, we’re not alive for very long, and we need to get used to the reality that we need to live in the present and stop planning for this future, perfect , smooth sailing life we’re at which we’re trying to arrive.",
    "The ideas in this book are floating around in the ether at the moment. It's the antidote to the productivity, work smart, squeeze every moment philosophy that's been around for 20 or 30 years. There's books about rest, 4 day week initiatives and a growing realisation that trying to be more productive is only making us more stressed. So I think it's fair to say that Burkeman won't be the only person to write this book, but I do think he will have written the best and most thoughtful iteration of it.\n\nA self proclaimed productivity geek, Burkeman has come to a lot of the same conclusions that have started to bug me over the last few years. Time is finite. No matter how efficient we get we'll never do everything we feel we're supposed to do. The answer he says is to acknowledge our limitations and be honest with ourselves that the life we're living right now is what we have.\n\nBy stopping struggling against the limits of time we can enjoy what we're doing right now, and really invest and commit to it. Instead of believing we're capable of engaging with every opportunity the modern world presents to us, we have to make hard choices about what we really want to do. What if you weren't trying to get somewhere? What if you accepted that you're already as here as you're ever going to be, what would you do then? He highlights the peril the instrumentalisation of time, always doing something for what might happen in the future. Taking a picture of fireworks so you can enjoy it later instead of enjoying the moment.\n\nIt's not necessarily an easy thing to do. Because the theme that runs through the book is that you genuinely can't do everything you want to do, and not doing some things means giving up on some of your dreams. But it is liberating to realise that actually, it doesn't matter in the end, you can let go and really focus on what you're doing. It means trading in a flawless fantasy where you do everything perfectly for the messy reality where you do a handful of things in ways you might fail at. It means giving up certainty to some extent, since committing to something means taking a path without knowing exactly where you're going. But the alternative is to go nowhere.\n\nIt's a level headed read that takes in a wide range of influences from philosophy and other writers, to great effect as the wisdom of the book is much deeper than you would expect from what is technically a tome about time management. I've highlighted all the way through and I'll definitely be returning to it to absorb it more fully.\n\nThere aren't really any tricks or frameworks to subscribe to. A while ago I read books on techniques on how to make better choices, how I could weigh up each option and make the \"right\" choice. It's more like a guide to confronting reality, accepting that you will fail and you will make the wrong choices sometimes. But that's ok, and it's a lot less stressful than trying to maintain the impossible standard of always choosing right, always filling your time in the right way.",
    "All my life I’ve struggled with time guilt - whatever I was doing I felt guilty that I should be doing something else. When my children were little I felt I should be doing chores when I was with them & vice versus. I’ve corrected that over the years and know what is important to me & spend more time on the things I love. But still felt pressured to do more with my life - always striving for something in the future - this book addresses all that & I had more than 1 “ oh my god” moments when it seemed like it was reading my mind. It is uncanny! Here’s the thing - you CANT do everything & achieve everything. I still have plans but this book has taken a weight off my mind & given me permission to enjoy the moment I’m in & life I’m living now!! Highly recommend - I read it cover to cover in 1 day!!",
    "For the last 40 years I have been trying to perfect my time management skills, optimise all aspects of my life and have suffered anxiety over my ever increasing lists of things to do. This book has rescued me from this trap. In recent years I had been developing a sense of somehow being conned by so many lifestyle tips that treat people as a machine and the author here has articulated that problem really well. I am utterly utterly grateful to him for revealing so many hidden truths. I have never read anything as useful to somebody as obsessive as me to turn around my thinking.",
    "The book has some very good passages and I highlighted quite a few in the first part of the book. However, there are very few paragraph breaks and one observation/insight flows continually into the next. This makes it hard to digest and really quite tiring. I feel that the author could really use a good editor to sort things out a bit better and provide a better journey through the book.\n\nIn regards of the content, the book is really quite philosophical and is valuable for getting you to stand back and look at your life, your attention and quality of life. Despite the continual torrent of sentences, it is a worthwhile read.",
    "Four Thousand Weeks is a good book with lots of ideas for wanting to get oneself organised and focused on relevant, big things, rather than the small, less significant things in life that can get in the way and bog down more important projects. As I read the book, I felt that much of what Burkeman advocates chimes very much with my own ideas about productivity.\n\nBurkeman outlines his thesis at the very start, writing:\n\n“The real problem isn’t our limited time. The real problem – or so I hope to convince you – is that we’ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by, a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse.”\n\nThere is little to disagree with in Four Thousand Weeks. Most of the advice is useful and evidenced based as Burkeman guides his readers through a labyrinth of self-help, organisational and productivity tips, some of which are very good and worth taking on board. Others, put to the test, fall to the wayside.\n\nHis own ideas, which amount to using one’s time well by focusing mainly on a few key projects, only adding new projects when initial key ones are completed, is a fairly loose way of putting it, for there is more detail and nuance in Burkeman’s approach.\n\nFor example, when referring to Stephen Covey’s parable of the rocks in the jar, he writes: “The critical question isn’t how to differentiate between activities that matter and those that don’t, but what to do when far too many things feel at least somewhat important, and therefore arguably qualify as big rocks.”\n\nIn addition, Burkeman writes particularly well. There is the occasional flourish into the long, abstract sentence; though this is the exception rather than the rule. For most part, ideas were expressed clearly throughout the book and generally easy to comprehend. And there are some great stories along the way, such as the one about Franz Kafka being torn between his work and love for Felice Bauer.\n\nThe book is also full of quotable passages. Here are three, though I could have picked many more.\n\n“Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.”\n\n“The technologies we use to try to ‘get on top of everything’ always fail us, in the end, because they increase the size of the ’everything’ of which we’re trying to get on top.”\n\n“One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.”\n\nAll in all, I would recommend Four Thousand Weeks for it has much to offer, whether you agree with Burkeman’s ideas or not.\n\nI hope you find my review helpful."

This book is incredible, highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with anxiety, depression, or overthinking also.

    "My thoughts spin out of control, catastrophizing the latest fear. I am sobbing and in the depths of yet another anxiety loop almost to the point of a panic attack. I can barely breathe, much less speak as my husband sits before me with worry creasing his brow. He begs me to tell him what is going on, but I can’t get the words out. It had been days that the clutches of something bigger than me, heavier, toxic had a hold on me. It was more than I could manage alone. Not only was I suffering, but those closest to me were suffering because of me as well. As he leaves the room without answers, I cry out, “God please! Please help me heal myself, send me whatever I need to heal, I am desperate God, I do not want to do this ever again!” Within a couple days, if not the very next day, I receive an email from Joseph Ngyuen (how I got on his email list, I may never know) about a book coming out the next day called “Don’t Believe Everything You Think”. I was intrigued but also dismissed it because it just seemed like the latest gimmicky self help book that was sure to offer nothing more than what I’d already read in the countless books that lined my shelves. I got another email the following day announcing its release. It was only $.99, what did I have to lose? No excuses. I bought the book, the digital version, and began to read immediately. Within just a few minutes of reading, I had the epiphany that would change my life. I realized that the narrative thinking was the cause of ALL my suffering, everyone’s in fact. I knew that I had been torturing myself thru these ruminating thoughts all these years, but I never really put together that I could control the narrative. I had to take back my power. I may be powerless to the thoughts that pop into my mind, but I have complete control on the narrative I play out about them. I can either choose to think about the thoughts, or I can just let them come and go without adding a story to them. Ever since that day I have applied this, refusing to create a narrative around the thoughts that pop into my head. I have experienced more peace and joy than anytime I can remember. Literally nothing is bringing me down (and that’s not for lack of circumstances). If I start to realize I’m feeling upset, I immediately recognize that it’s my thoughts making me upset. A situation or event is just what it is, I am the one creating the meaning around it. If the meaning I am creating is causing me to feel bad I need to stop and examine the story I am telling myself. Once I do this I decide to do something about it or let it go, either way I stop the story. Once the story stops, the suffering dissipates and I am free to go about my day unencumbered. Praise the Lord for sending me this gift! And thanks to Mr. Ngyuen for writing it and providing it to the world. Everyone should read this book.",
    "I’ve found one simple task to end my overactive braincells from thinking yet it’s not easy. It’s not easy to go to a non-thinking state and stay there but I’d say it’s totally worth it. This book gave me a lot of insights about myself and about the world we live in. I resonated with the author when he shared that he was in his darkest hour that he found the light. I’ve been searching for happiness everywhere not knowing that I can only find it within me. This book has helped me to rediscover my passion is and it is learning and sharing what I’ve learned to the world. This is one of the self help books that actually makes sense! Hats off to the author!",
    "Going through this book I can tell the dude knows his field. Many concepts were easy to apply instantly and have been helpful to stop me from overthinking.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the writing sounds like a high school/college student trying to fill a page count. Could've delivered the same message in half the words.\n\nOverall, solid read and would recommend",
    "If you are trying to find a way out of the constant cloud that weighs your mind/body down from everyday life, this book will help you discover that. Looking for another step in my own journey to continue improving myself, the words from Joseph truly hit home. We are victims are of own thinking and society feeds this condition. The ability to break away from this “thinking” is like a superhuman trait. It’s unbelievable how the book, broken down so easily into small chapters to digest every part contributes to the absorption of the information which you can apply as you finish read. Very rarely does this happen with other books. I’m so glad I stumbled upon this gem. It has truly changed my perception on life and the “thinking” that used to be part of it.",
    "The book places emphasis over how thinking creates our unhappiness/suffering. Thought it made plenty of sense and a great reminder of how important it is to get back into the ebb and flow of life!",
    "Thank you so much to the author for sharing your knowing with the world and helping other discover the truth!!! I am so thankful for the quotes before each chapter begins and the little stories that will stick with me forever! As soon as the thinking turns on I remember the stories told in the book and it’s sooo helpful! For instance the boat during meditation that’s me!!!! Thank you so so much for this life changing book! Your purpose was to put this out ! I listen to Abraham almost daily so I am already aware but it’s like we receive so differently from different people and it hits us different every time it’s through a different person! So thank you and everyone buy buy buy!",
    "I highly recommend this book. I have been on the awakening journey for many years, and this book served me very well as a reminder to be present and not overthink. Yes, the ideas in the book of controlling your thoughts and being present are not new, they have existed ever since humans did. However, what is unique about this book is the author, he belongs to the current springing generation and structured his book in a way that would be perfectly digested by his fellow humans from the same generation. I think he is a beautiful representation of the new generation, people his age. Not everyone from this generation would understand Eckhart Tolle, Michael Singer, and Alan Watts. Joseph simplified it, and that is what this new generation needs, something simple and short in this fast-paced era. Thanks Joe!",
    "I’m a great believer in not throwing the baby out with the bath water… But there’s an awful lot of water in this.\n\nAnd the one tenet the author proposes that really gets my goat is that if you’re not experiencing your new, hoped-for state of bliss, joy and love (and, by extension, financial security), maybe it’s because you’re just not _believing_ hard enough… This, my friends, is the basis of so much cod philosophy and psychology and it makes me angry!\n\nThere are a few interesting ideas in there, largely to do with how over-thinking can get in your own way, some thought-provoking quotations of the kind that daily flood our insta-feeds and the notion of goals being fuelled by inspiration or desperation, but those of you who are allergic to the kind of ‘woo-woo’ found in volumes like The Secret will, like me, come out in a rash.\n\nOverall: meh. There are so many fantastic self-help and psychology books out there, and this really is a rather shallow contribution to the oeuvre.",
    "This is my first ever Amazon review but this book has had such an immediate positive effect on me that I feel I should.\nI was was stuck in months long cycle of negativity. So much so it consumed me. I knew I had to do something, speak to a doctor, seek therapy.... something. Then I read this book. It is very simple, not rocket science but a series of lightbulb moments. That something I was searching for, that help I needed to break free, was in this book.\nLiterally over night, that cloud of negativity has lifted.",
    "Honestly couldn't put it down made me think about life in a whole new light everything feels a bit brighter, dont get me wrong its not gonna fix all your problems no book is magic unfortunately, but its definitely helps you look at life differently, first few pages are a bit of a confusing intro but once you get into it, it starts to become more clear 😉 one I think I will find my self repeatedly reading and recommending in the future.\ndont overthink the purchase you won't regret it follow your intuition :)",
    "I have read countless books on growth and the mind etc but this wee book is an absolute game changer... Joseph really laid out in simple ways of understanding how to apply this way of thinking too your life. And the bulletpoints at the back are great for reference... I read this book in a day I couldn't put it down. Highlighted all the bits I want to refer back to. And the wee stop to ask yourself the questions but before moving on really gives you great insight thru reading it. Thanks so much Joseph for bringing to my awareness that staying in the moment and being aware of how your thinking is what causes your own misery is all you need to create a happier more joyous life...\n\nAbsolutely amazing book. Love it"

    "Bret Easton Ellis’ novel, American Psycho, has just about as a precarious history as the contents held within its blood splattered pages. First released by Simon & Schuster in early 1991 and soon after quickly sold to Vintage by the publisher for undisclosed reasons and for an undisclosed sum of money. For us folks doing a review in 2015, almost a quarter of a century down the road, this sounds quite bizarre for a publisher to boot such a phenomenal piece of horror fiction -- however, apparently during the early 90’s, American Psycho was received a tad bit differently than one might expect today. Today, American Psycho is heralded as a postmodern cult classic, used no less in hip English lit classes and sociology classes, hell maybe even psychology classes, and if teachers were really smart, criminology classes! Its very strange looking back at American Psycho’s first release and reading all the vile contemptuous swings reviewers and readers and the media alike took at Ellis. Especially considering how during the same year Silence of the Lambs was released theatrically and went on to win dozens of awards, including: The Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, etc. etc. How can a movie and book about cannibalism, the most taboo thing imaginable, shine with audiences while at the same time American Psycho can be chased away by a mob with flaming torches and pitch forks? According to Ellis, who stated in a somewhat recent interview, “It was feminists and The New York Times. Hand-wringing liberals [who] were upset about ‘American Psycho.’ I don't think there was a single peep from conservatives or anyone like that. It was a liberal witch hunt and I was at the center of it” (The Oregonian, 2010). In a previous interview with Roger Cohen, from the New York Times, back during his books initial release, in response to the numerous death threats he had received in the mail, Mr. Ellis said that he “had no idea the novel would provoke the reception it's gotten, and I still don't quite get it” (New York Times, 1991). It is so bizarre how Anthony Hopkins chewing some dudes face off can be considered highbrow, while American Psycho, which had more to say regarding the quiet submission to consumerism and desensitization of the silent majority than any other work of fiction at the time, can be held with such contempt.\nIn retrospect of heavy criticisms, Mr. Ellis follows with one of the most profound statements regarding the craft of writing, something I believe all writers should well remember, when he states: “You do not write a novel for praise, or thinking of your audience. You write for yourself; you work out between you and your pen the things that intrigue you” (New York Times, 1991). And with American Psycho, as this humble reviewer understands it, Ellis was “working out” how society during the late 1980’s had considered the “surface” things, such as: food, clothes, money, etc., to be the only means in which a person can be defined. And this comment on society becomes obviously apparent and satirically metaphorical when you begin to read his book. In the very first pages, Ellis numbs the mind by using the narrator, Patrick Bateman, who also so happens to be a complete lunatic, to list off in excruciating detail all the many “surface” things he sees on the day to day, such as: designer suits, Walkman’s, music, movies, furniture, TV shows, restaurants, food, etc., etc. These things are important to him, while at the same time, not important. Even the murders are so brutally detailed, eventually at least (the book does have a sense of pace to it), that we become, in a way, desensitized to the violence just as much as we are desensitized to the material. Everything becomes banal. Here is what Pat Bateman has to say for himself towards the end of the book after he emerges from a near-psychotic break:\n\n“There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there…” (American Psycho, pgs. 376-377).\n\nThe above statement was made popular with the release of the theatrical version of the book, staring Christian Bale, back in 2000. And the madman goes on, of course. Bateman questions the very banality of evil, “is evil something we are or something we do?” etc. etc. And by the end, he finds what we “normal” folks might consider to be the deeper things in life, such as: war and politics, family, discoveries, sunrises, heroes, falling in love, blah-blah-blah, to be also utterly dull. Bateman can only find one clear emotion within him, greed – oh and perhaps, as he suggested -- disgust. The most pungent scene, for me, that invokes this macabre bland worldview is at the beginning of the book. Patrick is waiting on Patricia who so happens to be late for their date. When she finally arrives, Patrick narrates, nonchalantly, that she is safe from his knife, safe from him cutting open her throat and watching her bleed with mild disinterest, not because of any kind of luck, and not really because she comes from a wealthy stock, but simply and callously because Bateman made the choice. Bateman states: “Patricia will stay alive, and this victory requires no skill, no leaps of the imagination, no ingenuity on anyone’s part. This is simply how the world, my world, moves” (American Psycho, pg. 282). When I first read this line…my bones were chilled by the eerie ordinariness of it. The stylization is so humdrum you can actually feel madness slipping on like an old pair of slippers as you read the narrators ghastly horrific plunge further down into the rabbit-hole. When he finally emerges, you’re expecting some earth shattering revelation, but his only revelation is that nothing matters. It is what it is. He is what he is. The world is what it is. And there is nothing special in that. And there is nothing special in monotony.\n\nWhen thinking what American Psycho means to me in 2015, I’m struck by an overwhelming sadness in how some horror books and movies are never appreciated in their day. The heinous reception of American Psycho in 1991 and how it has now become this beloved cult classic reminds me so much of John Carpenter’s adaptation of “Who Goes There” with The Thing (1982). Both were completely hated and bashed by not only critics (which we should expect) but also by audiences. American Psycho stands out to me, not only because of its quip attitude toward yuppie culture during the 1980’s, an excellent timepiece for modern day writers to resource, but also because you can feel the character, the crazed loon, desperately trying to be normal even though he is anything but normal, till the end when he finally snaps and the story whips from first person to third and finally back to first when Pat Bateman realizes there is no “normal.” It’s oddly human and somewhat farcical, something we might even call dark comedy. Everyone around Bateman is, in a lot of ways, similar to one another. They have little to no empathy towards others, not even with each other. This is often seen in not only how they talk and what they discuss, what’s of importance to them, but in how grossly they mistreat the homeless, which during the 80’s was witness to some of the highest percentages in American history. And the very same brutal detail in what they wear and what they eat and who they sleep with. In this, they are mirror images. The only difference, the only way Patrick sets himself apart, is his murderous and sexual appetites (though you could argue his sexual desires are also in line with everyone else). But this is all beneath the “surface,” and when it comes to the criticisms of the book, perhaps those same voices who threatened Bret’s life could only see what was floating on top. On the “surface” are the boring albeit grim details of every little aspect in Pat Bateman’s life, the clothes, the music, the food, the women, and even the way he imagines lacerating those same women. Beneath are metaphors, how we see society, how we place value on meaningless things, how we look at those around us as things, how we’ve become completely callous toward suffering. This is why the book is still so popular and important for readers today. If we can get past the brutality and sink our heads beneath the lapping waves of the mundane, to peer into the depths of consequentialism, for a moment at least, before we’re gasping up for air, we can walk away with some realization or dare I say an awakening. If even for only a moment.\nIf you have yet to read Bret Easton Ellis’ 1991 masterpiece, American Psycho -- well, as the saying goes: there is no time like the present. Just be forewarned that the book is written from the first person perspective. Today, few stories are told from the first person narration. Personally, the only first person stories I’ve read are Lovecraftian. However, I suggest you give the book a fair amount of patience. And patience you will need. As mentioned in my review above, the author goes into grave detail about everything. You will be numbed -- but isn’t that the point?",
    "I didn't think I would ever read anything that would make me think that an age restriction for a book could be realistically justified. And then I read Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. Patrick Bateman is a New York City banking bro in the 1980s. It would seem like he has a pretty great life: his job is prestigious and pays well, he has a pretty fiancee, he works out regularly and is in good shape, he has a nice apartment. But what Patrick also has going on is a gnawing emptiness at his center, and violent urges he's not quite able to control. He lashes out at first against the powerless: poor people, prostitutes. But his need to hurt people escalates farther and farther until he's committing actual atrocities against even people he knows, while somehow still trying to keep it together enough to go to work and live his life as normally as possible.\n\nI'm not usually overly puritanical about depictions of sex and violence in books. Sex and violence are (fortunately and unfortunately, respectively) parts of life. And I'd seen the movie! I thought I had a handle on what was in store. But this book doesn't just flounce right over the line of being gratuitous, it goes into actively stomach-churning territory. There are things I read in this book that gave me pictures in my head I will never unsee and honestly gave me heaves. And part of it, I think, is deliberate...besides being just gross, the book is also a razor-sharp satire. A recurring motif are Bateman's much-stressed-about trips to the video store, where he rents violent pornography which desensitizes him both towards normal sex and violence against women. Living in a culture where depictions of outlandish acts of sex and violence are easy to access means that it requires yet more extreme examples to achieve the titillating/disturbing effect...examples, of course, that the text itself provides. It's clever, if also very off-putting.\n\nI had a really hard time deciding how I felt about this book. As a cutting send-up of the consumer culture of the 1980s, particularly in the heart of the NYC finance scene, it was extremely effective and often entertaining. The agonies about getting a table at the latest bougie restaurant serving the most unappetizing-seeming \"exotic\" food combinations were dead on. The way the book played with identity, with Patrick both constantly mistaking people he sees for people he knows and being wrong, and himself being called by the incorrect name, because as seriously as he takes his outfits (most of which are described in detail), the end result is that he looks just like everyone else, was smart and insightful. I would be pulled in and admiring the craft of it...and then there would be a gruesome murder and I would pulled back out again.\n\nEven just skimming much of the over-the-top portions of the book (it gets worse and worse as it goes along), it was a reading experience I found really difficult. This book has age restrictions for access in several countries, and I'm actually not mad about it. I might have found one of the few things I actually don't think a teenager should read without an adult having to be a part of the process. I don't know that I would affirmatively recommend that anyone read this book, it's that messed up. Which is a pity, because the parts of it that are satirical are incredibly well-executed (pun sort-of intended) and effective. But the rest of it is just too much. Yes, it's worse than the movie. Much, much worse. If your interest in still piqued and you have an iron stomach, there is merit here. But be prepared.",
    "I wonder if there is any other book that I could describe as “unreadable” and still mean it as a compliment. The writing is meticulously crafted to let us watch Patrick Bateman losing himself to his psychopathy. That it is unreadable is only natural.\n\nThe soullessly pornographic play-by-play commentary of the sex scenes, and the unflinchingly matter-of-fact descriptions of torture and mutilation; these passages become harder and harder to read, until finally I could only skim them as lightly as possible, and yet they’re so necessary to give you a frank representation of Patrick Bateman’s mind, and his unblinking detachment from these acts.\n\nEven in his more mundane day-to-day dealings, his compulsion to break down the components of outfits, the catalogue-like descriptions of home furnishings and technology, and especially the whole chapters dedicated to his reviews of music artists – these also wear thin over time, but are just as important to show that in which he consistently places value, and on which he relies to maintain his mask of human sanity.\n\nAlthough Patrick makes for a difficult narrator, Ellis’ skilful writing comes into play outside of this narrative too, in giving a fuller sense of the world he moves in: the repetitive, shallow conversation topics; the interchangeability of Bateman and his peers; how he can give blunt warnings and even admissions of guilt without ever being heard. It’s these touches, as well as Bateman’s increasingly frantic and futile attempts to retain control of himself, that make this book compelling in spite of Patrick’s narrative.",
    "American Psycho is the modern equivalent of The Great Gatsby, where money is king and shallow appearances are the only thing that matter. Where Gatsby focuses on the American Jazz era, Psycho is the Yuppie (Young, Upwardly-mobile Professional) decade of the 1980s, set in Wall Street, New York, at the time of the great economic boom.\n\nThe first half of the book demonstrates, in great tedious detail, the superficial lifestyle of the wealthy. Every character in every scene is described by their designer clothes, from their sunglasses to their underwear and socks; grooming and television rituals; where and what they eat in expensive trendy restaurants and hotels; their crass and vacuous conversations about other rich people and how to match handkerchiefs and socks.\n\nHowever, underneath this frivolity is a very dark and disturbing theme. There is plenty of wealth but no value. Racism is cruelly obvious as the homeless and low-paid workers are not part of the Yuppie elite and are ridiculed, mutilated and murdered for no other reason than that. The grotesque objectification of women is taken to the level where they are literally bought and treated as things to be used and discarded in obscene scenes of depravity and horror.\n\nThe protagonist talks about how he would like to murder, or has murdered or tortured people, but none of his peers listens or takes him seriously. There are frequent cases of mistaken identity or name confusion. Characters swap partners as there are no emotional bonds. None of this matters because everyone is the same and therefore interchangeable.\n\nAs the story develops, the violence, obscenity and murder increase. Sometimes the protagonist feels as if he is a film, another superficial and fake version of reality, and he refers to himself in the third person with exciting action scenes typical of Hollywood. He is not sure what has taken place is in his head or not and tests his peers about missing persons he believes he has murdered. He obviously thinks the ramifications would be more satisfying or at least acknowledged.\n\nThis is very much an anti-materialistic tale. These characters have everything money can buy, but they are empty and hollow inside, devoid of love, compassion and fulfilment. Perhaps torture and murder is a way to connect with the living and life because the designer clothes and gadgets don't fill the hole. What is missing is a heart, something the American Psycho, the consumerist capitalist, does not have.",
    "I don't believe the point the writer is trying to make comes across at all. He does explain his point in the afterword but I'm afraid it was lost on me. I saw the film years ago and enjoyed it, so I expected the source material to be even better. Ellis explains in the afterword that this book is meant to be how men are expected to look, behave and dress a certain way, an unattainable standard men are held to and their struggle with it. This didn't come across in the book at all, in fact all the characters seem to enjoy the materialism and shallowness, never once is it described as an annoyance or something they resent. If it was written better, he wouldn't have needed to make his point separately!\n\nOnly once have I ever given up on a book, and this was almost a second time.\nThe painful monotony and repetition makes this a very frustrating read. Only because I'd seen the film did I understand why we were subjected to paragraph after paragraph describing every item of clothing, furniture, drink and everything else - I don't think this was clear from the writing alone. From the readers point of view this was a tedious waste of time. On top of this, 20 plus mentions of Les Misérables. For a book based in New York City, I'd expect the author to be able to name at least one other Broadway show, for crying out loud. If I missed the point of this repetition, I'm way past caring.\n\nThere were 3 chapters that served absolutely zero purpose, and they were describing the songs and albums of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. My goodness, that was boring, and again, no explanation as to why the reader was subjected to it. The film definitely does this better and it doesn't feel quite so random.\n\nThe violence portrayed is certainly shocking, but that is what the author wants as far as I can tell. He wants to shock, to offend, to revolt - in this, he is successful. I am no stranger to crime, horror and thriller novels but the degree of violence in this book is excessive. The animal abuse, the defilement of women, all makes for very uncomfortable reading. How any of it related to his point made in the afterword, I'm afraid I really didn't understand.\n\nIn summary, I despised this book, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Quite frankly a very poor execution of what should have been a great story.",
    "A colleague told me that after she finished reading American Psycho she ripped the book up. She destroyed it. She hated it so much that she violently tore it apart.\n\nThere were times during the most obscene scenes of torture, rape and murder that I understood her need to wipe it out.\n\nI can see why it sits in a cannon of modern classics, it is in and of itself a unique comment on the materialistic focus of the late 20th century, the emptiness and futility of life when brands and restaurants are rated more highly than kindness, friendship and love.\n\nFrom a 2020 perspective, the relentless Trump references and Bateman's hero worship of him is telling. A president placed on a pedestal for cut throat money making and phallic over compensating with his tower.\n\nWomen are dehumanized. Only Paul Owen's disappearance is investigated, only Solly the male taxi driver's death drives another to revenge, only the murder of a male child results in public weeping. Female victims don't matter. To Bateman or to anyone else in the novel.\n\nIf I'd not already seen the film a long time ago I'd have spent more time thinking it's all a delusion, that Bateman has made it all up.\n\nBret Easton Ellis made a statement. It's vacuous and horrific on purpose.",
    "To say I enjoyed this story would be incorrect (how can one enjoy such violence?) but I did enjoy being inside the head of a maniac. The main character is, for want of a better description, batshit crazy, going from an image conscious, well-groomed high achiever to drug-addled torturer and murder in the clink of a champagne flute.\n\nThe format of the book is bonkers yet it works so well in further cementing the image of a psychopath: chapters which are polished and full of intellect are followed by disjointed chapters full of dark imagery and darker actions. Then there are the chapters concerning the music of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. Completely random and totally inspired! On a serious note though, this book contains every trigger possible. Read it with extreme caution - it’s easy to see why this book has been, and in some places continues to be, a banned book. Having said that, it’s only a story.\n\nSo, decapitated coffee, anyone?"

    "This book is labeled as a novel but is actually the reflections of the author’s experience during the years as a young volunteer in the German Army during the First World War. The author is represented by the central fictional character, Paul Baumer. The book begins with Paul comforting a young boyhood friend and classmate, Franz Kemmerisch, who was a fellow young volunteer suffering from a combat wound and dying in a field hospital. Toward the end of the book, another combat death occurred, this time an older soldier and the author’s mentor, Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky. In between, there was the scene of hand-to-hand combat, during which Paul killed a French soldier in a trench. For several hours, he watched the man die, slowly and painfully. He felt remorse and asked forgiveness from the man's corpse. He was emotionally devastated. When he rejoined his comrades, they tried to comfort him and reassured him that it was only part of the war.\n\nThere were descriptions of horrific combat wounds:\n\n“We see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run with their two feet cut off; we see men without mouths, without jaws, without faces…..”\n\nThen there was the narrative when the author and several of his comrades were wounded and taken to an army hospital. The surgeon-general of the hospital was keen on amputations, regardless of whether the procedure was necessary. On frequent occasions, patients in serious conditions were taken to the “dying room”. Returning from the dying room was extremely rare. Fortunately, it did occur to one of Paul’s comrades.\n\nOut of such experiences, the author offered many memorable utterances and reflections:\n\n● “We reach the zone where the front begins and become on the instant human animals.”\n● “We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world, and we had to shoot it to pieces.”\n● “Terror can be endured so long as a man simply ducts – but it kills, if a man thinks about it.”\n● “Every full-grown emperor requires at least one war, otherwise he would not become famous……And generals too, they become even more famous than emperors.”\n\nA most thoughtful and sensible proposal was made by Paul’s friend Albert Knopp. “He proposes that a declaration of war should be a kind of popular festival with entrance-tickets and bands, like a bull fight. Then in the arena the ministers and generals of the two countries, dressed in bathing-drawers and armed with clubs, can have it out among themselves. Whoever survives, his country wins. That would be much simpler and more just than the present arrangement, where the wrong people do the fighting.”\n\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is considered by many the greatest war novel of all time. Be that as it may, it is doubtful that the author’s wisdom, gained through painful personal experience and enunciated poignantly in the book, has made any significant impact in reducing the number of wars among nations, which are led by humans who, according to Mark Twain, “…was made at the end of the week’s work, when God was tired”.",
    "one of the most important war books ever written . this book is truly a eye opener to the first world war 1, so little is know about it, despite it being fiction every character feels so real and natural and is a sad tale of most soldiers in ww1. side note when the book arrived to my house the back cover was slightly ripped",
    "A moving story, gave me a whole new insight on the German side of WW1, and the men who fought it.",
    "This is one of those books that was required reading back when I was in high school that has held up for me well into adulthood. I've read it several times, though probably not in the past decade (until recently). As I approach middle age, I think it has an even more profound effect on me.\n\nWhat drew me to this book in my teen years still holds true. You almost forget that this is told from the point of view of a German soldier - one of our enemies in the Great War (aka WWI). Instead it personifies almost any soldier - the chaos and destruction of battle, the importance of friendship, the fear and hunger of the unknown, the frustration of not really understanding what you are fighting for while someone else - in a safe place - is calling the shots.\n\nThe horrors of trench warfare are tastefully, yet explicitly described in such a way that you feel as if you are there, but still have the protection of not being there. Remarque, through Paul, waxes rather poetically about all of the trials and tribulations of being on the front and how it changes a man. I'm often moved by the sincere and intense emotions - and abrupt lack thereof. Paul becomes almost a friend. And though he is the enemy as a German soldier, my humanity roots for him and his friends to come out of it okay in the end\n\nIt's been over 100 years since World War I ended, of course, but I still think this is an important book to continue reading from a history perspective, but also a human perspective.",
    "A multi-generational world famous novel concerning a veterans horrific time spent in WW1 combat. Yet, this edition of kindle sports a wild west cartoon cover of a mounted cowboy complete with Arizonan icons of cacti and mountains? I do like westerns, but this depressing anti-war novel is about as far from being a western as \"To Kill A Mockingbird\". The publisher really needs to correct this goofy mistake. Does anyone follow through with quality control anymore?",
    "This is a classic book, well worth the read. This edition is well made, a stellar addition to any library. The story is timeless.",
    "It is just as described physically, but the book bored me to death",
    "Entertaining.",
    "A MUST READ for anyone with even a cursory interest in the first world war. A must read for all.\n\nPrior to reading this book I had read Robert Graves', 'Goodbye To All That,' and Ernst Junger's 'Storm Of Steel,' both of which were interesting books. For whatever reason, I did not have high expectations for All Quiet, but upon turning the first few pages, immediately found myself gripped by its tone. Within a matter of sentences I was thrusted onto the frontline of the Western Front. Through it's gritty, often mythical force of language! From quiet contemplation to mad, titanic displays of industrial warfare! Although it is a translation, the weight of Remarque's words are experienced wholly.\n\nAs a reader you are immersed, at first, into the optimistic and humoured tone of the 'nameless soldier' and his youthful comrades ... but as the war painfully drags on, the narrative does not spare you. The tone shifts to one of despair and ultimately into a dead, stony resignation. The war consumes all -- all emotion, all youth, all hope and any thought of a return to normality. All of it is obliterated in the same swift, meaningless manner as the 'nameless soldier's' comrades.\n\nThis book is masterful and should remind its readers why it is so important to remember what happened little over a century ago.",
    "Erich Maria Remarque's account of the his experiences as a German soldier on the Western Front are told through the fictional story of Private Paul Bauer who is encouraged to enlist together his entire school class. The account of the destruction and death of his friends through the horrors of trench warfare is told in a poignant and evocative manner. The story dissects the psychological effects upon Bauer and his colleagues, his alienation from his fellow non-combatant countrymen, and the manner in which the soldiers deal with the ever present threat of death. The book contains episodes which are vividly descriptive, tragic and often imbued with a wry gallows-humour. An essential read in the 100th anniversary year of the beginning of WW1. So much for 'The war to end all wars'. It is easy to see that the story and experiences of Bauer apply to those on the opposite side of the trenches.\nI thought the modern translation brought the text to life in a vivid and compelling manner. The short biography of Remarque at the end was also enlightening.",
    "In this rightly called classic anti-war novel, E.M. Remarque depicts forcefully the brutal awakening of a group of young soldiers in World War I.\n\nFailed education, breakdown of ideals\nThe preachers glorified the Fatherland, the romantic character of war. For them, duty to one's country should be the greatest thing. But, they concealed the real interests behind the war, the rulers, the war profiteers and their acolytes.\nThe first death in war shattered all belief that authority was a synonym for greater insight and more human wisdom. The recruits immediately felt that the army leaders considered them as beasts, training them as `circus-ponies'.\nThe romantic war turned into butchery: `if we were to give morphia to everyone, we would have to had tubs full.'\n\nUniversal comradeship and the ideal solution\nIn direct confrontations, the soldiers came to understand that the enemies were in fact brothers: `Comrade, I did not want to kill you. But you were only an idea to me before, an abstraction ... Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours? If we threw away these rifles and this uniform you could be my brother.'\nThe ideal solution is to consider war `as a bullfight. The ministers and generals of the countries (in war), armed with clubs, can have it out among themselves. Whoever survives, his country wins. That would be more simple and just than this arrangement, where the wrong people do the fighting.'\n\nPromise not fulfilled\n`How senseless is everything that can ever be written, done, or thought, when such things are possible. It must be all lies and of no account when a culture of a thousand years could not prevent this stream of blood. I see how people are set against one another and foolishly, obediently slay one another. I see that the keenest of brains of the world invent weapons and words to make it yet more refined and enduring. I promise you, comrade. It shall never happen again!'\n\nStrong scenes and metaphors\nAbout war: `three enemy trenches with their garrison, all stiff as though stricken with apoplexy, with blue faces, dead.'\nAbout war and peace: `We hear the muffled rumble of the front only as a distant thunder, bumblebees droning by quite drown it. Around us stretches the flowery meadow.'\nAbout death: `These nails will continue to grow like fantastic cellar plants. They twist themselves into corkscrews and grow and with them the hair on the decaying skull, just like grass in good soil.'\n\nUnforgettably, E. M. Remarque evoked in a highly emotional language the tragic fate of a lost generation. But also, it was `of no account'. The war machine continued to rumble all over the world.\n\nI also highly recommend the hard-hitting and very insightful memoirs from the other side of the channel written by Robert Graves in `Goodbye to All That.'\nThese books stand in sharp contrast with `the ice cold hedonist attitude within plain Barbarism' (T. Mann) expressed in the texts of Ernst Jünger about the same war.",
    "The great strength of this book is that there are no histrionics, no jingoism, no hatred, just the author Paul telling his story of the War in a low-key matter-of-fact way, a way that stretches our emotions to the limit. The horror (and stupidity) of war can never have been portrayed in a more convincing way: war dehumanises; kill or be killed; life is cheap.\n\nAnd, yet, basic human instincts remain, as is exemplified by Paul's various reactions to his killing of the French compositor, Gerard Duval-writing which will remain in my mind for some time.\n\nParticularly poignant is the fact that Paul's horrible experiences at the front are not believed or recognised by family or friends at home when he is on leave. The civilian population is still gung-ho, perhaps an early example of the triumph of propaganda over reality. Shades of Blair's \"weapons of mass destruction\"?\n\nThis book preaches a powerful anti-war message, but is anyone listening? Today's politicians have no experience of the horrors of war and show little sign of having learned from the past. Surely no survivor of Ypres would have thought invading Iraq was worthwhile.\n\nA must-read and an easy read.",
    "World War I in this novel is seen through the eyes of a young German solider called Paul Baumer. Paul naively joins up along with a band of school friends with the encouragement of their teacher. He is sent to the front where he is quickly confronted with the realities of warfare in the trenches. His hardships are all detailed and include the lack of food, the filth and his friends joining the casualties as the war goes on. Paul hates and resents his situation but he copes, he copes with having to kill people, he copes seeing his friends die and in doing so he begins to change in himself. He eventually comes to the conclusion that he has essentially died inside.\n\nThis novel is devoid of politics and the bigger picture is never revealed, even the enemy themselves are often referred to as 'the ones over there' . The novel instead focuses solely on the humanity and the solider giving a honest vivid account on the torrents of war.\n\nDon't run away with the idea that his book is depressing. Certainty its moving and dark in places, but the overall writing is very matter of fact and to the point leaving you with images or scenes that you are unlikely to ever forget."

    "This book was not at all what I was expecting, but contains some good advice that many would benefit from. For some background, my wife and I are relatively young and have career jobs. I bought this book for information on making the most of any extra income, learning more about investing strategies, options for generating passive income, and improving my personal finances. I did learn a few things, but not on these topics (maybe a bit on the last point). The book primarily focuses on interesting finds and anecdotes from the authors' years of research on millionaires in America.\n\nThe book is divided into eight chapters:\n1. Meet the Millionaire Next Door\n2. Frugal Frugal Frugal\n3. Time, Energy, and Money\n4. You Aren't What You Drive\n5. Economic Outpatient Care\n6. Affirmative Action, Family Style\n7. Find Your Niche\n8. Jobs: Millionaire vs. Heirs\n\nThe author essentially splits everyone into two categories: Underaccumulators of Wealth (UAWs) and Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs). UAWs have a low net worth relative to income, and the opposite for PAWs and uses these terms throughout the book.\n\nHis primary argument is that PAWs get to be wealthy by living well below their means - these are people who do not look like millionaires, they live in modest neighborhoods, drive domestic sedans, wear a Timex, and usually have a blue-collar job that does not come with an expensive lifestyle associated and as a result can accumulate a sizeable nest egg. On the other hand, UAWs are typically well-educated professionals with high paying and high profile jobs (doctors, attorneys), but due to societal pressures associated with their social standing are forced to squander all their money living in luxury neighborhoods, driving German cars, and sending their kids to private schools. Their expensive lifestyle means that they spend most of their income and as a result have a low net worth, despite outward appearances.\n\nI agree that this is good advice for just about anyone: live below your means and prioritize financial security over social standing. Growing up in a single-income family living in a modest middle class neighborhood, I'm quite used to the live-below-your-means philosophy and I think it gave me at least some sense of good financial discipline. If my parents are any indication, it works great.\n\nWhere the authors really lost my interest is that the rest of the book is chock full of anecdotes and some rather uninformative statistics to drive a few other points home. While some of these are good points and undoubtedly useful, they always seem to come with caveats or don't draw any real conclusion, which I found frustrating. Most of the points could have been made succinctly in about 1/10 the amount of page space the authors dedicate to them. These include:\n\n- Most millionaires in America are self employed business owners, because they run their personal finances like their business finances. However, going into business for yourself is very risky so we don't really recommend that as a viable way to get rich.\n\n- Very few millionaires have ever spent much money on a nice suit, pair of shoes, or luxury watch. They usually live in modest neighborhoods or rural areas where the cost of living and social pressures of consumerism are lower.\n\n- First generation millionaires (often immigrants) tend to be succeeded by children with financial struggles, since the parent's desire to \"give them a better life\" pushes them into careers where they become UAWs, and their upbringing in our consumerist culture impedes their ability to live frugally. But even if it turns them into UAWs, encourage them to go to college and aspire to a while-collar professional job.\n\n- Parents giving money to their children develops and reinforces poor financial habits. This money is almost always immediately spent, and these children generally have no savings since they are looking to their parents as their safety net and counting on an inheritance. Doing things like buying children a house in an upscale neighborhood or sending grandkids to a private school actually makes the children worse off, since they have to spend more to maintain the associated lifestyle.\n\n- The authors spend an inordinate amount of time and space comparing different careers, which I found next to useless since I'm very happy with my chosen career (Engineer) and have no intention of changing. They continually deride pretty much every professional job you can think of, and simultaneously praises how great working for yourself or owning a business is while going on about how difficult and risky it is to actually own a successful business. The author does not recommend changing careers, but again, this is more of a discussion of what their research has shown than any sort of \"how to\" advice.\n\n- Car buyers fall into four categories: whether you buy new or used, and whether you buy from the same place or shop around. The authors devote an entire chapter to this while only coming to the following conclusions: no method of buying a car is the clear winner, but if you own a business you may benefit from your connections with the owners of car dealerships; and most millionaires drive unassuming domestic (and to a lesser extent, Japanese) cars purchased new or lightly used.\n\nA final note - curiously, I found no mention of anything real-estate related, which to me is highly unusual in any sort of book about building wealth. The only investment advice found here is in the final chapter and could be summarized as \"invest in what you know.\" That is, if you work in a certain sector, your knowledge of the industry will help you make good investment decisions. Not sure how I feel about this one. For example: not working in technology doesn't mean blue-chip tech stocks are a bad investment. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nOne last complaint: most of the financial figures are presented in mid-1990s dollars. I found it frustrating to have to mentally convert to today's dollars to get a relative sense. The authors took the time to update the preface in 2010, it would have been nice to see a revision to the figures quoted throughout the book. (For reference, one 1996 dollar is worth about 1.6 dollars in 2017).\n\nIn summary, I was surprised about the amount of praise heaped on this book. I would hardly categorize it as a self-help book, it's more a retrospective on the authors' research and a collection of anecdotes and interesting conclusions about the countless Americans leading unglamorous lives while accumulating appreciable amounts of wealth. It's a quick read and I made it through the whole book on a 5-hour flight with time to spare. I would only recommend this book as an interesting overview of some good financial habits, or as an eye-opener for those with luxurious financial tendencies who struggle to save money despite their income level. However, for those who have already developed some discipline and are looking for detailed strategies and advice on personal finance and building wealth via investments and generating passive income, look elsewhere.",
    "No one likes the topic of finances, but we all want to know how to keep more of our money. This book will really make you think about your own spending and savings habits without making you feel defensive. It was easy to read, easy to follow, and well written.",
    "With the current supply chain issue, it's totally understandable that the book arrived a few days late. It arrived in excellent condition without any noticeable signs of wear. Considering the price I paid, it really exceeded my expectations. This seller will definitely be on my list for future purchases!",
    "Are some of the illustrations out of date? Yes. Do some of the ideas such as men with long term marriages most likely to be millionaires non PC? Yes. Save instead of spend obvious? Yep. Uncomfortable mirror if you belong to a country club, drive a brand new luxury car, have a Rolex, send your kids to a private prep school and then get derided as a UAW (under accumulator of wealth) repeatedly? Ouch cause the real millionaires quoted make fun of you as all hat no cattle, repeatedly. And not one of those criticisms matter at all because this book is such an eye opener about who becomes wealthy and how. For the most part they don't inherit it, they don't win it, they don't have a secret formula. What they do is avoid living by rich people, live below their means, earn well, and save/invest over a lifetime. The only thing missing is how the millionaires get decent careers or businesses - three things I can help you with. One - every college is a business so they will tell you \"follow your dreams\" not \"4% of our undergrad degrees are biology of which we can only place 30% in biology jobs (what are we to do, fire 70% of the biology department to help undergrads and then tell you the whole truth about our business?)\". Two - never work for someone else unless they are teaching you how to become their competitor or skills that will help you open your own business. Three - the business world is littered with closed cupcake stores so don't do what you love; instead do a SWOT analysis, do your due diligence, identify the barriers to entry (better be some!), know your first two years cash flow, find a ready market, don't be late to said market, get your spouse working because that extra revenue stream will buy you time, calculate your exact burn rate on one income and save two years worth, and if at all possible start your business part time while still working. So you can discount the criticism of this book as most negative reviewers haven't read it in full, don't like the political insinuations, are defensive big spenders, or wanted some secret that would make them rich. Here is a simple trick to start spending less - look at everything you do in 10 year cost. Hulu $6 per month/ $72 per year / $720 per 10 years - for me worth it. Specialty coffee $5 per day / $150 per month /$1800 per year /$18000 - that right $18,000 over 10 years - no way. Just set two simple goals - first get in the top quartile of household income, and second save 20% of pretax income. If you are under 35 and do those two things (oh and read/follow this book) you may retire in comfort and be in control of your life because you won't be scampering from one bill to the next, in perpetual fear that you might lose your job, always and forever on the wheel.",
    "This is a motivational read for those who want to build wealth - a ‘piggy bank’ in excess of your needs. The central message though is a fairly unsurprising one - to build wealth you need to spend less than you earn and invest the difference to grow over the long term. That might elicit the response ‘No kidding Sherlock!’, but the point is that most of us don’t do it even though it’s within reach of most of us to do so. In much the same way to lose weight we just need to consume less calories than we expend - easy eh?!\n\nThe point of the book’s title is that many apparently affluent people (nice house, car, clothes, gadgets) may not have much in their piggy bank because they are driving, wearing and displaying it instead. People who do have a lot of wealth built up do so because they are living a very modest life - ‘the person next door’.\n\nThe only downsides for me were the repetitive facts and figures drawn from their research which pads out a booklet into a book. Pretty soon you might get fed up of the ‘this percent of that, which as a percentage of this, as a ratio of’ and just start skim reading it as you got the point from the first paragraph.\n\nYou also have to wonder ‘what’s the point?’. You can’t take the piggy bank with you when you die, no matter how big you get it. So of course there is a balance - which I don’t think the book strikes - in knowing the basic things you need for a sufficient life and then using your wealth to enrich your own and other’s lives.",
    "Even though the research is based on America's wealthy, it's interesting to see how habits of the wealthy can be replicated wherever you are in the world. Now, being a black man from modest background, I have always been saddened to witness that most of Congolese people who dress expensive and look wealthy are broke as a joke. While the nerd, silly looking white man is the richest guy at the party. I have few other book references to help me identify the traits of a millionaire (i.e. The richest man in town, the richest man in Babylon, Rich dad, poor dad; Live your life not theirs, why your thinking is keeping you poor) but the study conducted in TMND is astounding. I decided to use the title of the book as my What'sApp tagline because I intend to become one.",
    "This book was highly recommended on a financial independence/early retirement blog I follow so decided to give it a read. The core message of the book is excellent and insightful. However it could've been covered off much more concisely. The authors had run extensive surveys ahead of this book and so it seems to me that they felt the need to belabor the point by going over every single aspect of their findings via this book. By the time you're a third of the way through you find yourself not learning anything new and just wanting it to be over already.",
    "What is the best way to become a millionaire? Frugal! Frugal!! Frugal!!! Awesome book overall. The book is very American and about American millionaires. I'm African, wish it had a more global perspective but you learn applicable knowledge, regardless of location. I recommend 100%",
    "The ideas in this book are well-known and simple, the problem is that it takes so long to get to the point. You can read about these ideas on any personal finance blog on the internet in much less time.\n\nI agree with many that criticize this book for its clear survivorship bias; starting a business is not going to be the right thing for everyone. Perhaps focusing on \"successful upper-middle-class\" financially independent types would have been more realistic and helpful to most, but \"The Financially Secure Person Next Door\" wouldn't be as good a title."

    "This story about Janie Crawford, a black woman in the South who wants to love and be loved, is spectacular. In Zora Neale Hurston's capable hands, the reader vicariously experiences several incarnations of Janie's life from poor to rich, disrespected to loved, and desperate to satisfied. Steeped in the Black vernacular of the times, a ripe understanding of people, and told in brilliant poetic prose, Their Eyes Are Watching God is a lush read.\n\nA simple sentence by Hurston transports me to Janie's world, \"The morning road air was like a new dress.\"\n\nHer descriptions gift us with a character's essence, \"Daisy is walking a drum tune. You can almost hear it by looking at the way she walks. She is black and she knows that white clothes look good on her, so she wears them for dress up. She’s got those big black eyes with plenty shiny white in them that makes them shine like brand new money and she knows what God gave women eyelashes for, too.\"\n\nHer deft portrayals of life enthrall, \"The wind came back with triple fury, and put out the light for the last time. They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His. They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God.\"\n\nHer takes on humanity resonate, \"Then the band played, and Tea Cake rode like a Pharaoh to his tomb. No expensive veils and robes for Janie this time. She went on in her overalls. She was too busy feeling grief to dress like grief.\"\n\nHer many memorable, quotable lines shine bright, \"Rumor, that wingless bird, had shadowed over the town.\"\n\nIn 1973, Alice Walker had a headstone placed at her gravesite with this epitaph: “Zora Neale Hurston: A Genius of the South.\"\n\nIndeed.",
    "For centuries, marriage has evolved into a contract rather than a proclamation of love; it dictated the roles the man and woman would play and suppressed the woman under the influence of the stronger man. In the brilliantly-written novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale Hurston explores whether marriage could be built on trust and love rather than submission and negotiation by detailing the intricately woven life of Janie Mae Crawford and her experiences with marriage.\nIn the beginning of the novel, Janie is quickly ushered into an arranged marriage with Mr. Logan Killicks, a rich and older African-American man. Janie only agreed to the marriage because she had thought that eventually “she would love Logan after they were married...Husbands and wives loved each other, and that was what marriage meant. It was just so” (Hurston 27). Ever since the day Janie was sixteen and sat underneath a pear tree and gazed up at the bees merrily buzzing in and out of the blossoms, she believed that a marriage could be one of love and self-fulfillment. She tried to have that love but quickly discovered that she was never going to love Mr.Killicks the way the bees loved the pear tree’s blossoms: “She knew that marriage did not make love” (29). One cannot simply walk into a marriage without loving the other person first. Love already has to be present in the relationship for there to be love in the marriage. Love does not grow from unfamiliarity; it stems from trust.\nWhen Janie married her second husband, Joe Stark, he became infatuated with power rather than with her. As the mayor of Eatonville, he left her to do the chores around the house and would yell at her for making mistakes in their store. Janie’s personality remained hidden inside of herself; she could not do as she pleased and obeyed her husband’s commands like a slave. Joe “wanted her submission and he’d keep on fighting until he felt he had it” (64). He also believed he was “building a high chair for her to sit in and overlook the world [but] she [was] pouting over it” (57). Because there was no true communication between the husband and wife, both were left unsettled by the other. In order for a marriage to last, there has to be honesty between the two partners. Both of them would have needed to drop their pretenses in order to fully accept and understand the other person. However, because Janie kept a part of herself locked away from Mr.Starks and because Joe kept demanding her submission rather than allowing her to be herself, she could never truly love him nor would he ever know her.\nIt was not until Janie’s final marriage to Tea Cakes that she began to feel happy and loved. Tea Cakes always wanted to be with her. He taught her to play checkers, made her laugh, and provided anything for her. He was even the only man Janie compared to her pear tree: “He could be a bee to a blossom-a pear tree blossom in the spring” (90). Though their relationship had its flaws, there was trust and honesty between the two. Their marriage may have been the briefest, but it was the only one that left Janie truly grieving when it was over: “No expensive veils and robes for Janie this time. She went on in her overalls. She was too busy feeling grief to dress like grief” (149).\nIn Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston expertly weaves the truths behind marriage through Janie’s experiences with failed and lost love. In the end, marriage is a contract; it does have its rules and obligations, but it is also about working together to build an open and caring relationship, not a dictatorship.",
    "A most read book.",
    "Zora Neale Hurston was born to write.\nThis 1930s deeply human story of one indefatigable black woman's life, loves and catastrophes dazzled and delighted me from start to finish.\nIt was apparently written in a hurry and the story does have a breakneck feel to it. Characterful expressions burst from its pages; the syncopated, lively dialogue of the black people of the day is lush and gorgeous to read.\nBut please don't accept my effusive review as a recommendation. This book is not a generic crowd-pleaser and won't suit all tastes.\nIt is dialogue heavy and at times I felt I was reading a theatre script, rather than a novel.\nI've seen that some readers weren't able to get to grips with the spoken vernacular, which surprises me no end. This white English/Irish guy had no problem whatsoever!\nFor me, the writing was irresistible. I do however think it wouldn't be for everyone.",
    "In this story we meet Janie who is the main protagonist. The author brings the Southern style of talking alive with the characters. It made me feel like I was right there within the story, talking along with them.\n\nWe are taken back in time to when Janie was a child and I felt privileged to be able to hear of her Nanny (Grandma), giving a bit of history to what life was like for her and Janie’s mum. It shows the dark side of what life was like many years ago with the author describing how diverse things were back then.\n\nIn fact the author deals with many subjects within this story. Diversity, racism, domestic as well as mental abuse to name but a few. It makes for quite a sombre read but Janie is such a larger than life character and there is much to take in of her life over time and her relationships with three different men. Each one brings something different with it to the reader.\n\nI can see why this book has been described as an American classic. It makes for a good solid read and I enjoyed the author’s laid back style of writing. Whilst it didn’t quite impact me in the way I had hoped, Their Eyes Were Watching God is still a novel that people should consider giving a go.",
    "I am really thrilled to have found this author, bought this book on kindle but have now purchased other writings in book form and will do the same for this as I think it is a special find which I will pass on to others.. There is real beauty in this book, which is her most famous, some of the descriptions of events are poetic and without pretension or an overt political attitude, the story unfolds and is not predictable so I would not read any literary reviews talking about characters etc. before reading the story in full. Enough said as there are reviews published within the book hence my suggestion.",
    "Their Eyes Were Watching God is one of those books that you feel you ought to love because it occupies such an iconic position in 20th century literature. I can’t say I found it an easy read for the reasons I’ll set out shortly but I certainly admired it and felt more kindly towards the book in the second half.\n\nThe main thing I found difficult about the book was that much of Janie’s story is rendered in vernacular. This does give it a fantastic sense of authenticity but, initially, I found it difficult to get to grips with and found myself having to re-read sentences to ensure I understood what was being said.\n\nJanie is a young woman who instinctively wants more from life (although she doesn’t know quite what) and snatches the opportunities that arise although more often than not, sadly, they don’t work out. A recurring theme of the book is the silencing of women, in particular by men but more generally by society. When Janie finally meets someone who seems to want her to be herself and not be constrained, it ends in tragedy.\n\nI did find it strange that at certain points in the book the author chooses to switch from Janie articulating her story directly to the third person. The Afterword included in my edition (an essay by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.) describes this as the author shifting ‘back and forth between her “literate” narrator’s voice and a highly idiomatic black voice found in wonderful passages of free indirect discourse’. In one section, the book even switches to the point of view of Janie’s second husband, Jody. And towards the end of the book, when Janie is on trial accused of a serious crime, the reader doesn’t get to hear her defence in her own words.\n\nThe author’s writing craft is demonstrated by some imaginative turns of phrase. For example, when Janie wakes up in time to see ‘the sun sending up spies ahead of him to mark out the road through the dark’ or, sitting on her porch one evening she watches the moon rise. ‘Soon its amber fluid was drenching the earth, and quenching the thirst of the day.’ And there is real drama created in the scenes set in the Everglades during which Janie, Tea Cake (her third husband) and others flee the flood water created by the passing hurricane. (It is during this section that the book’s title appears.)",
    "It took me a while to adjust to the ever changing play between lyrical narrative prose and the dialect the author uses when her characters speak. Their Eyes Were Watching God isn’t a book about God, but the story of a woman of colour (“coffee and cream” complexion with amazing hair!). Janie experiences a sensual awakening at 16 and kisses a passing guy at the gate. Her grandmother, scared that Janie will ruin her life, marries her off to an older man. The book charts Janie’s relationships with the three men in her life, particularly her second husband, Joe, and third husband TeaCake; more than that it charts Janie’s suppression of herself and eventual self-discovery through finding genuine love with TeaCake. The author’s descriptive prose is beautifully fat and paints an amazing picture of Janie’s hopes as they bloom.\n\nCriticism: there’s a theme of domestic violence and it’s sometimes passed off as almost good and reasonable. I suspect it wouldn’t be nowadays, but the novel is a child of its time in that respect."

    "Son needed it for school",
    "this graphic novel is just a general good read recommendation but also it was in good new condition",
    "I have taught this book to my tenth grade English students for the past five years, and I believe it has helped to send my former students into society as informed adults with enough perspective to see Iranian people as fellow global citizens, not Middle Eastern enemies.\nSatrapi wrote the book to inform people about the Islamic Revolution and to give readers an insider perspective. I know that the book was originally written in French, and then later translated to English, which are the main languages of the Western world. This points to her intended audience - Westerners. Satrapi was trying to show the Western world what Iranian people are really like -- not extremists, not radical Muslims - but mostly peace-loving, creative, independently thinking people who value their Persian culture and lifestyle and have suffered greatly for remaining in their homeland in spite of the challenges.\nThroughout the book, she paints herself as religiously moderate and politically involved, even as a child, and not at all negative towards the West. With images of the Iranian hostage crisis in the back of our minds, it is easy for Americans to assume that all Iranians hate Americans, but this is far from true. Satrapi shows her love for Western culture and music and books with Michael Jackson and Kim Wilde and Iron Maiden. She mostly clearly demonstrates the impact of their suffering with how drastically the loss of her Uncle Anoosh impacted her. She also wants people to have the facts about the revolution as well, which we see in the wealth of historical information integrated into her memoir.\nI personally believe that Satrapi was very effective in helping society see Iranians differently, mostly from my personal experience. Before reading this book six years ago, I assumed that if the theocracy remains in power, that must mean that the majority of people in Iran must be really religious and anti-West, or else why wouldn't they overthrow their government? This book helped me see that they are really suffering under a different kind of tyranny, and also helped me understand why it happened. She shows why they overthrew the Shah - for freedom from an oppressive government, a government in which she knew that the difference between the social classes caused many people pain, but then she also shows throughout the rest of the book how the Iranian people were manipulated into becoming faithful to an Islamic regime.\nThe serious re-structuring of schools caused great suffering and contributed to the difficulty with changing mindsets. If the religious government controls the schools, then the children are inculcated with the religious ideas, much like how Marjane was initially inculcated with the thought that the Shah was chosen by God. In addition, the Islamic regime ultimately secured their power by uniting the Iranian people in war against a foreign enemy and carrying on the war until the society was so completely devastated, they would not have the energy or desire to cause further revolt of any kind.\nI think this is an important topic for the Western world to see, as Western relations with Iran affect us in many ways. Our government currently has strict economic sanctions on Iran, which causes our gas prices to go up and impacts us where we feel it the most, our wallets; however, most people do not see the reason behind this, and why the world needs to take note of the tyranny in Iran. In addition, many people here in the United States lump together all of the people in the Middle East under the label of \"Arabs\" and then furthermore, see them all as extreme Muslims and terrorists, particularly since 9/11. As a student pointed out in class today, the book was published shortly after 9/11, which is likely not a coincidence. In the days after this event, many Americans viewed any Middle Eastern man with a beard or any Middle Eastern woman with a hijab as a terrorist, a threat; yet Marjane paints us a much needed picture of a world so many Americans do not realize exists - a world in which many free spirited Iranian people endure a forced dress code that represents far more oppression than we here in America could ever imagine.",
    "Came as Advertised and in Great Shape!",
    "This condition of this books was listed as \"very good\" with minimal highlighting and notes. The book arrived with significant highlight and notes. Luckily, my daughter said it would not impact her ability to read/use the book for summer reading purposes. However, I had limited my condition criteria to very good or better and I spent more to purchase a book described as very good. Given the condition of this book, I might as well have purchased a book labelled \"good\" and saved some money.",
    "I am an English tutor. Many of the people I help are Arabic. When you deal with any culture, it is inevitable that difficulties will arise due to cultural differences. It is worse, though, when there are political difficulties between your country and theirs. Naturally, both sides are going to have prejudices. To better understand the people I deal with, I have been trying to familiarize myself with the cultures that I come into contact with. This is why I chose this book.\n\nIt is a graphic novel. However, though the pictures might attract younger readers, I should warn anyone who is purchasing books for their child that it is probably more appropriate for teens. It depends, of course, on how much parents protect their child and how willing they are to answer questions. Though the book isn't exactly \"snuff\" (meaning it focuses totally on violence and killing), it doesn't shy away from the violence that the author witnessed or heard about. There is one picture that shows a man urinating on another man (as a form of torture). There are references to torture, dismemberment, and rape. Another picture showed how the army locked a bunch of people inside a movie theater and set fire to it.\n\nAll that aside, this is mostly a book about a girl growing up in Tehran, Iran during the Islamic Revolution. The story starts in 1979-1980, when she is ten years old. It concludes when she is fourteen years old (though there is a sequel book after this one). It has a very strong plot and provides interesting tidbits about Islamic culture. Iran has had a tumultuous history that is rather hard to keep track of. However, this was particularly interesting because some of the events were ones I heard about when I was a child growing up. It provides another viewpoint on the same events--such as Saddam Hussein's campaign against Iran. There is also some nostalgia, as the girl had a fascination with American culture of that period. Though some of the things depicted are disturbing--moreso because the book is visual--it has its moments of humor. The author successfully humanizes the characters so you can identify and sympathize with them to some degree.\n\nI did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it to older readers who are interested in learning about other cultures. If you like \"coming of age\" stories, you will probably like this too. Be warned that it won't always made you feel good, and it may be inappropriate for young people and sensitive people. However, it is a good book--and I plan to keep it, as well as buy the sequel.",
    "Very original format: telling the story of a revolution, a major event in world history, through a graphic story about a little girl coming of age. She is from a middle class family in Tehran and tells us about the fall of the Shah and the rise of the islamic republic thourgh the eyes of a child. A child who is very aware of what is going on around her and is not afraid to speak up. Through the microstory of her family, her school, her relatives and neighbors we learn a lot about everyday life in Tehran in that period.\n\nThe book ends with her departure for Austria in 1983 where her parents sent her to be safe from the dangers of war with Iraq and of internal repression. I am looking forward to reading the sequel  Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return\n\nPS I am not sure why the author chose the title Persepolis for this book, does anyone know?",
    "It does not make sense but Marjane Satrapi's decision to recount her memoir about growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution using a comic strip actually renders the tale more rather than less poignant. Her artwork propels the reader so quickly through the horrors which have accompanied each recent regime change in Iran that the impact is maximised. It also proves to be the right medium to represent the quickened loss of innocence which Satrapi experiences as a result.\n\nSatrapi herself is revealed as a spirited teenage rebel not averse to confrontation with her own parents and to her credit these encounters are candidly, and often comically, repeated no matter how self-absorbed they reveal her to have been.\n\nThis is a must read.",
    "Another great book to start with if you want to get into reading like me. Beautifully and visually depicts life of a young girl in war torn Iran and really makes you think of your own privilege.",
    "Excellent read",
    "Persepolis has always been a favourite. So simple in its comic style telling a tale so deep. Great read for anyone looking for that 'something different' and will leave you wanting to read the second part."

    "It’s an eye-opening book on the importance of “non-traditional” indicators. The book brings to light the positive correlation between the collapse of well-being and political changes that happened in the Arab spring and even Brexit.\nInteresting review of business philosophies. A debate happening online and boardrooms. I realized that I am a customer capitalist. I highly recommend it.",
    "I think the biggest surprise is that the rise of global unhappiness began prior to the events of COVID-19. I think the book does a great job of demonstrating why these \"emotions\" matter so much and how they affect us all",
    "The earlier Gallup books have always been insightful, from their surveys of employees they discover 12 questions that measure engagement, and from engagement levels their empirical research shows that engagement leads to profitability. Now oh how the mighty have fallen. Chapter 19 is now full of assertions pretending to be facts. This is a chapter for solutions for corporations. These are not tested solutions. The suggestion is to improve the ESG process to include employee subsets of employee engagement. Companies use a DEI department to increase their ESG score. The problem is the equity is at best a zero sum game. While a focus on equality is a win win. It is hard to see another more effective way to lower employee engagement than a zero sum game with their career. Great resignation anyone? The old way of clearly stating the problem and put the causes on the stop doing list are not considered. I have seen DEI departments ask coworkers in arranged marriages what is their gender identity, and devout Muslims their sexual orientation. These questions make no sense and demonstrate cultural imperialism.",
    "Jon Clifton wrote this book in order to explain \"where the world is suffering in each of Gallup's five elements of wellbeing [work, finances, physical health, communities, and relationships with family and friends] and where it can improve...The book starts by outlining the indicators [i.e. early-warning signs] that leaders can watch so that they are never surprised again by rising stress, sadness, or anger...I hope this book makes you think differently about measuring happiness. And by the time you are done reading it, I hope you become more interested in understanding how people feel in your organization, your community, and your country.\"\n\nThe insights shared in this book are based on about five million surveys that were conducted in almost 170 countries; roughly two million in the U.S. and three million globally. \"We also conducted panel studies, which allow us to track the same people over time we can better understand what causes changes in wellbeing, such as economy collapse, a job loss, or the death of a spouse...Gallup's wellbeing research is truly global, covering over 98% of the world's adult population. It includes almost every ethnic group, religion, and income level and virtually every kind of human experience worldwide.\"\n\nIt would bed a disservice to this book as well as to everyone involved in its creation to reveal the key points made in chapters whose subjects focus on issues such as these:\n\nThree: \"The Happiest People in the World?\"\nFour: \"How on Earth Do You Measure Happiness?\"\nSeven: \"The Five Elements of a Great Life\"\nThirteen: \"The Serious Outcomes of Unhappiness\"\nFourteen: \"How Are Women's Lives Ging?\"\nEighteen: \"What Public Sector Leaders Can Do\"\nNineteen: \"What Private Sector Leaders Can Do\"\nTwenty: \"What Public Sector and Private Sector Leaders Can Do Together\"\n\nGallup's narrative is research-driven in ways and to an extent far greater and more complicated than almost any work of non-fiction I have read in the last decade. Key points must be shared in context, within a frame of reference. This is especially true of relative terms such as wellbeing, happiness, and success.\n\nWith regard to this book's subtitle -- \"The Global Rise of UNHAPPINESS and How Leaders Missed It\" -- it is important to keep in mind the importance of measurement that is [begin italics] appropriate [end italics] as well as accurate and sufficient. For example, telephone surveys indicated that incumbent Herbert Hoover would achieve a landslide victory over his Democrat opponent, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1932 Presidential election. In fact, Roosevelt won 46 of 48 states and had 472 electoral votes to Hoover's 59. Why was a telephone poll inappropriate and thus essentially worthless? Most of the people who could afford one in 1932 were Republicans.\n\nCheck out \"The \"New World Happiness Report\" (PAGE 217) which ranks foreign countries in combination with U.S. states, viewed as if they were also foreign countries. To what extent differently (if any) would workers in #1 Finland define wellbeing than how workers would define it in Brazil, Luxembourg, and Malta, tied for 70th and last among countries? To what extent (if any) would workers in Israel (ranked #13 in a tie with New Zealand) define it than would define it in Utah (ranked #7 in a tie with Alaska)? Leaders in both public and private sectors need to know what such differences are and how best to address them.\n\nMany years ago, Southwest Airlines' then chairman and CEO, Herb Kelleher, was asked to explain why its profits and cap value were greater than its nine major competitors [begin italics] combined [end italics]. He replied, \"We take great care of our people. They take great care of our customers. And our customers take great care of our shareholders.\" If you disagree with this approach, consider this: companies annually ranked among those most highly admired and best to work for are also annually ranked among those most profitable, with the greatest cap value in their industry segment. That is not a coincidence.\n\nJon Gallup shares an abundance of valuable information, insights, and counsel that can help leaders in almost any organization -- whatever its size and nature may be-- to understand trends that might otherwise be ignored or misunderstood. His book is a \"must-read\" for leaders in organizations that now have problems with employee engagement and especially with the retention of highly valued employees as well as problems with both market and customer share.",
    "If…I were a pastor, I would put my current sermon series on pause. Then I’d use my Bible and this hot-off-the-press book from Gallup—with 20 thought-provoking chapters. There’s enough meat in this remarkable book for 20 sermons, but maybe you’ll just pick your Top-10 favorites.\n\nJon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, has two words for leaders: “Blind Spot.” (You’re probably not surprised, are you?) This is another must-read book: \"Blind Spot: The Global Rise of Unhappiness and How Leaders Missed It.\"\n\nMy measure of a good book: how often do I read a paragraph or a whole page to my wife? Joanne doesn’t need to read \"Blind Spot\"—because I’ve read most of the book to her already! When the book arrived, I skipped to Chapter 16, “A Letter to Rwandan President Paul Kagame.” I was hooked.\n\nThen, properly, I read the intro and the overview—and kept going. Along the way, Clifton engages us in really big issues—but with humility. Why is there a global rise in unhappiness—and are our corporate and government leaders that clueless? (Gallup defines “happiness” as “subjective wellbeing,” but publishers apparently think “happiness” will sell more books! I love the transparency!)\n\nHere are seven teasers to share with your pastor or religious leader:\n\n#1. HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE U.S. The Gallup World Poll has been conducted in “over 160 countries and in 171 difference languages. In Africa alone, we have interviewed in 82 different languages.” (Stunning!) In 2011, a New York Times reporter asked Gallup, “What is the demographic profile of the happiest person in the United States?”\n\nGallup’s response enabled the reporter to find one person who fit Gallup’s response. Alvin Wong meets an unusual set of criteria. He is “Asian American, married with children, a Hawaii resident, an observant Jew, a tall male, a business owner, over 65, and making more than $120,000 per year.” The NYT story went viral and now Wong is a motivational speaker with his own website!\n\n#2. SURVEY SCIENCE 101. You’ve likely conducted formal or informal research using surveys, assessments, five-finger feedback, and other methods. But do you know the science behind the surveys—and how you ask the question might tilt the results? Throughout this book, I so appreciated the transparent and helpful (non-technical) pointers on what I’d label “survey science 101.” Example: In 2019, the President of Rwanda took issue with Gallup’s World Happiness Report during a speech at Columbia University. Chapter 16 is the Gallup CEO’s response to President Paul Kagame and discusses “three hypotheses for why Rwandans rank their live so low.” (Fascinating—and pretty good sermon material!)\n\n#3. IT’S NOT THE ECONOMY, STUPID. The Bible warns against the love of money—and not equating money with happiness. (Gallup has research!) The author’s probing theme, based on research: how people see their lives and how people live their lives. So, it won’t surprise you to learn that Gallup has asked citizens in the U.K. this simple two-part question:\n\n“Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.\n• Q1: On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? (0-10)\n• Q2: Just your best guess, on which step do you think you will stand in the future, say about five years from now? (0-10)”\n\nWhew! The research and the results are fascinating. Is your country near the top or the bottom on the happiness rankings? Trust me—you’ll read this entire book and wonder about (along with the author) why the survey results seem so contrarian to your unresearched biases! (Great sermon material!)\n\n#4. THE 3 BILLION BLIND SPOT: \"GREAT\" JOBS. Oh, my. The graphic on page 101 is heart-breaking! Of the 7.7 billion people on the planet, 3 billion don’t have a \"great\" job. And there are more contrarian prods from Gallup:\n\n“The current global unemployment metric holds leaders accountable to the lowest common denominator for jobs. The message is: ‘Let’s get the number of people with no work to the lowest percentage possible.’ Instead, the message should be: ‘Let’s get the number of people with great jobs to the highest percentage possible.’”\n\n#5. COLLEGE DEBT/SCARS. In Chapter 9, “Does Money Buy Happiness?” Clifton notes a Gallup survey of U.S. college grads with one question, “How does college debt affect people’s wellbeing?” Read the details in that chapter, but note this now: The researchers found that “college debt leaves an emotional scar on people even after they pay off the debt.” (Pastor’s Pop Quiz: How many of the New Testament parables address money?)\n\n#6. MINISTER OF LONELINESS. You can’t read this book without taking a deep breath and wonder if you, your organization, your house of worship, or your government could do more on improving the lives of people (and their happiness). See Chapters 14 to 17 on “Four Unanswered Questions,” including “How Are Women’s Lives Going?” and some puzzling research about Singapore, “The Emotionless Society.” Yet this is encouraging:\n\n“Governments are starting to take loneliness seriously. For example, Japan and the U.K. each have ministers of loneliness to tackle this problem.” (Does your church have a Minister of Loneliness? Is this a blind spot? Survey the residents in your zip code—and you might need to add a volunteer or staff position to address loneliness.)\n\n#7. IF U.S. STATES WERE COUNTRIES. This is fascinating! Gallup inserted all 50 U.S. states into the World Happiness Report rankings (averaged over 2016-2018). Are the people in your state happy?\n• Utah and Alaska ranked the highest (#7 worldwide)\n• North Dakota and Hawaii were ranked #9\n• West Virginia ranked the lowest at #66\n• Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas were a notch up at #51.\n\nThe Top-5 happiest countries (in order): Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Netherlands. (My Swedish friends came in at #12.)\n\nThis is a must-read (and must-preach) book! And thanks to the publisher for sending me a review copy."

    "For the geeks, the Polyvagal theorem connects attachment theory to physiology so the ideas in this book rest on very solid scientific ground.\n\nFor the rest of us, the book is affirmation of what all the great lovers teach about any relationship:\n1. Put Emotional Safety first for everyone\n2. Take responsibility for growing emotional safety\n3. Learn to repair violations of emotional safety\n\n\"And the greatest is love\" -- St Paul",
    "Dr. Sue Johnson is the master. The most important and significant psychologist since perhaps Carl Jung, and perhaps the greatest relationship psychologist of all time. The success rate in her clinic, where she works with the worst of the worst when it comes to couples (an ex-Marine with PTSD who was beaten by his dad and a woman who was sexually molested her whole childhood by an uncle), only shows what she can do for average couples who have problems that aren't as severe. However, the problem is that you cannot read this book in 3 days like some John Gray (he is not a doctor) pop psychology book. This is book involving a deep amount of research and clinical studies, but it is still written for the layperson. In essence, there are no easy answers.\n\nThe other issue is Dr. Sue's work flies in the face of 30+ years of psychology therapy which taught couples that they must be 100% happy, have all their ducks lined up in a row, and basically be perfect until they can have a great relationship. Bull. According to Dr. Sue, a deep romantic relationship with a partner is base in part of healing childhood wounds and other traumas. A romantic relationship most closely resembles the bond that exists between a mother and baby. It is not the SAME relationship (of course!). But in terms of the emotional intensity and closeness it is.\n\nShe has been on a crusade to eradicate co-dependency from psychological language. People NEED each other. They are interdependent, social creatures. Her books provide countless examples of people and other animals who thrive and are better thru having these \"hold me tight\" relationships. The comfort they bring leads to people thriving in life. It leads to more risk taking. It leads to better health. She has done countless MRI brain studies to show that when you are \"fighting\" with your partner, your brain looks EXACTLY like a lion is chasing you. The new part of brain has not evolved fast enough to deal with such fighting without the conversational techniques that she writes about and teaches. The bond between you and your partner is that INTENSE and that critical. The way you communicate with each other has to be so delicate.\n\nWhen a person is experiencing fear, pain, and all sorts of negative things, and an MRI is taken of their brain, Dr. Sue has shown that when the hurting person feels the touch of their partner's hand, it completely changes their brain and how it looks. It provides that level of comfort.\n\nAnd you want to tell me that people need to be 100% happy in order to have a healthy relationship? Yes individual therapy is useful in that it can allow you to understand where your thoughts, feelings and emotions are coming from, and how your partner can help you heal with it detracting from their own growth. But as U2 once said in a song, \"Sometimes You Just Can't Make It On Your Own.\"\n\nAnyone in an online dating profile who says they are 100% happy and is just looking for a partner to add to their happiness......well.....Dr. Sue would say stay single. Because relationships ARE HARD. They are not easy, and they are supposed to be that way. But the rewards far outgain the negatives. But she also says there are just too many people are coming in her clinic, and too many people coming into other psychologist's offices, to suggest that any relationship can just add to the 100% happiness that you already have. People are going into therapy because they crave that innate bond that is no important to survival and health of our species.\n\nThis is too hard to explain. I suggest reading both of her books Hold Me Tight and Love Sense. And yes, she claims love can be explained by science.",
    "Much of what passes for wisdom in the world when it comes to the intersection of love, personality and happiness never made sense to me. This book makes the case for love in a way that jives with my experience. I found the clarity herein very inspiring.",
    "I recommend this book for those who need a bit more perspective on why they get in such crazy fights, or who have a tendency to devalue their marriage: I am glad I read a fair amount and got my husband to read just as much but we did get bogged down after a while and did not finish it. We scored incredibly low on the ARE questionnaire (0 and 2) at first which was rather discouraging but we have improved since then: remember that a low score is not just a reflection on the recipient but on the overall quality of the relationship and the giver's willingness to trust the recipient. (Another person may score you much higher.)\n\nAfter having this book for 9 months (and still needing help) I purchased a different one: Six Secrets of a Lasting Relationship by Mark Goulston: it finishes the job as far as I am concerned. Personally I liked the use of the acronym CREATE to organize the book:(Chemistry,Respect, Enjoyment, Acceptance, Trust and Empathy). It gets to the heart of what is most important quickly and can be read and used much more quickly than Hold Me Tight.\n\nIn Six Secrets, each chapter covers its subject thoroughly with a variety of approaches to dealing with each problem and a good description of the most common array of difficulties. The organization allows you to skip to the areas of greatest concern as I did. Empathy is encouraged throughout but delved into more deeply near the end. If one's spouse is resistant to marriage books then you can read it by yourself (like I did) and still find it quite helpful. It urges spouses who are getting disrespect (me) to stick up for themselves in a dignified manner while doing what it takes to foster their own self-respect, just what I needed: the examples help one to see how much this can improve the situation while giving perspective as to why we may be stuck. The chapter on empathy showed how to provide empathy when needed but also how to stick up for oneself. I had already taken some measures but this helped me finish the job: it works.\n\nThe Six Secrets book not only helps one confront disrespect but also helps one to confront one's own character defects which may be leading to disrespect. The book gives a good list of such defects: I could easily see how I had played a role in my disrespect and how my spouse played a role in my disrepect of him. Seeing these causes spelled out made it much easier for me to address them.\n\nI loved the following passage from Six Secrets of a Lasting Relationship on p286 to be used after a husband comes home in a foul mood from work and the wife uses empathy to help him get a grip: He should not be given a free pass no matter how compassionate your empathy makes you feel. After you've defused the situation and made him feel understood, look him in the eye and say, \"You know, when bad things happen at work, I'd really appreciate it if you don't take it out on me. I'm on your side.\"\n\nMy only complaint is that Six Secrets lets those who disrespect their spouses off the hook too easily, saying they should just leave if they can't come up with such respect, when in some cases their values seem quite skewed. I think he could have questioned those values more, in such a case I would definitely recommend the book Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson because it lays out much more clearly what one stands to lose.\n\nHold Me Tight might also help if there is some unresolved pain from the past but Six Secrets of a Lasting Relationship may get to the same place more quickly. I do think that both books could cover gender differences more thoroughly, especially the differences in style when it comes to apologies, but I had already had those differences covered by a counselor and was very ready for these books which place far less emphasis on gender differences, my husband and I both probably have high testosterone levels, so chemistry wasn't a problem but fighting was. We are also reversed from the norm when it comes to focus vs. multitasking so the gender focused books did not have a great deal of appeal. I especially take issue with those which imply that women do not need respect as much as men.\n\nSix Secrets shows that eventually disrespect will rebound on a spouse so if men do need more respect they had better not be dishing out disrespect. It divides up the respect issue fairly well between the sexes with examples of disrespect in both sexes and it was easy to see myself in the disrespected person's shoes regardless of gender. It could probably use a few more examples of women behaving badly in the trust department since that seems to be tilted against men but I'll admit that I haven't read the whole thing yet and in any case, it does cover the measures which may be needed to restore trust (while not guaranteeing its restoration).",
    "A really good book for anyone in a relationship or working with relationships who's interested in how relationships can work better, it's equally good for self-help or for a helper. This book takes a very different approach from (e.g.) 'Fighting for your Marriage' (Howard Markman) or John Gottman's books. It's based on attachment theory which Johnson explains simply and clearly in just a few pages. Her approach is to define the self-perpetuating 'Demon Dialogues' partners get locked into, and to help the partners firstly to recognise that it's the 'demon dialogue' that's the enemy in the relationship rather than their partner, and secondly how to work together to stop the Demon Dialogue and to build constructive dialogues instead. An easy read, human and humane, very highly recommended.",
    "Finally. A book that not only explains love but can show us all a way of not only finding it but staying in it for life. Forget about fickle hormones it's all about secure attachment.",
    "Great way to get a summary of the method.",
    "Dr. Sue breaks down the science of connection and gives perspective through the dialogues between couples in therapy. You really come to understand the value of emotional responsiveness and secure connections. Even beyond the science, it’s the humanity of it, the real power of love and attachment. It applies to couples, to family and even society as a whole. Highly recommended!",
    "I am reading this book alongside undergoing couples therapy with my partner and honestly, it has been once of the most empowering things I have ever done. It was laughable how eerily true to life the examples of the negative patterns couples can fall into were, to the point where I was wondering if the author had based her entire body of research on observing me and my partner!\n\nThe advice and practical steps are beautiful in their simplicity and so powerful. I can not recommend this book highly enough to anyone who’s in a deeply loving relationship but finds themselves perplexed by why you are your partner can’t break out of negative communication patterns. The answers are all here waiting for you to discover."

    "My husband bought this for me, so I am writing this review. I was diagnosed as Autistic when I was 62. While I am retired now, and much of the \"business world\" masking no longer applies, I found this a fascinating and very informative book. It relates to anyone who is Autistic or anyone who knows someone with Autism.\nThe book is easy to read and there are a lot of interviews quoted so that the book is not just based on one person's viewpoint. Would highly recommend.",
    "As an eating-disordered, gender-meh academically-successful queer person who was given every diagnosis under the sun except autism (despite having two first-degree relatives officially diagnosed), this was a nearly religious experience. Dr. Price is an amazing non-fiction writer who comprehensively handles much of the recent history and sociological forces at play when it comes to recognizing who gets diagnosed and who doesn't.\n\nPersonally, this book catapulted me back to my college save point, absolutely overwhelmed by the world and its detritus, knowing that I had the brains to process it, but only if I could find a quiet spot to make sense of it all. I have known that I am on the spectrum for some time...but it was this book that made me embrace it. Thank you.",
    "After a lifetime of being misunderstood seeing just how cookie cutter I am of a late diagnosed has saved my life.",
    "You are on the forefront of big shifts in how we manage neurodiversity. Keep going!",
    "This book, no exaggeration, changed my life. I’m a late-identified Autistic and it’s been tough to process… I’m still coming to terms with a lot and figuring out what it all means for my life going forward. This book gave me a place to start.\n\nDr. Price’s book is thorough (in true autistic fashion lol) and heartfelt. It includes not just his own story and reflections, but features an array of quotes from voices not typically centered in discussions of the autistic experience (and clearly that inclusive approach has upset some reviewers, and it is pretty disturbing that apparently any mention of the experiences of non-white, non-male, non-cis person is so deeply threatening).\n\nIt’s also concerning to see all critical reviews so far seem to boil down to “this book talks about trans and gay people, ew”, and even “hey, don’t be so mean to TERFs!” (no, I don’t politely refer to anyone expressing blatant homophobia and transphobia as “gender critical” just like I don’t call white supremacists “race realists”, because I refuse to sanitize and validate bigotry). This is so troubling considering a significant number of Autistic folks are trans or otherwise LGBTQIA+. To reject our identities, to other us and complain when we merely speak of our experiences, is fundamentally to deny and reject the lives and experiences of Autistic people. In other words, it’s yet another variety of ableism. You can’t claim to care about Autistic people if you *only* want to hear the stories of cis, straight, white Autistics, or if you find the mere mention of the existence of the rest of us troubling or offensive. We aren’t going anywhere and we don’t owe you an apology for existing out loud.\n\nBut I digress… if you or someone you know is Autistic, this is a must-read. *Especially* if you grew up thinking only little white boys can be Autistic, or that there is only one way autism is expressed in a life… or if, like me, diagnosis has brought on a lot of fear or loss of identity. This is a book that I believe will help many navigate the path towards not only awareness, but community, and not only acceptance, but liberation. Make no mistake; this book IS radical. And I firmly believe it’s the medicine we need right now.",
    "I was diagnosed within the last 2 years with both ADHD & eventually Autism as a 32 & 34 year old woman. I've accepted both diagnosis readily as they explain so much about me. But I constantly struggled with how to take the mask off and was feeling even more burnt out being constantly aware how inauthentic I'd been to my true self my whole life. This book has helped me so much, I definitely recommend this for anyone diagnosed later in life.",
    "This book is incredibly helpful on the road to self validation and discovery for masked autistics. I’ve already gifted the book multiple times as it’s just so valuable on the journey.",
    "Fun to read, feeling validated, wish ever close to me would read this book. There many different voices from different backgrounds telling there stories.",
    "Cannot recommend a book more than Unmasking Autism! Devon really hits the nail on the head and I identified with him a lot throughout the book. So many practical steps to unmask yourself too and makes me see how much I do mask. A must read if you're autistic! Cried a couple of times reading it as I've never felt so seen. Never cried at a book before. On my second read already. There are also references and an index at the back of the book.",
    "As a late-diagnosed autistic person, this is the best book about autism I have read so far. The exercises are really helpful and I related so much to some of the points made. I think it would really help allistic people to understand autistic people better if they read this book. It should be on a required reading list for all educators, health professionals and social workers.",
    "This book feels like an instruction manual for how to live happily as a late-diagnosed autistic. I will probably dip in to this book again and again. I am very grateful to have found this book.\n\nThis is an essential read for any autistic who has been masking, but would recommend to anyone who suspects they may be autistic or wants to support an autistic loved one.",
    "This book is an incredible look into the side of autism not seen in popular media. It explores the aspects of autism inherent to so many people's lives, and the incredible strain of hiding these feelings and behaviours in order to pretend to be normal.\n\nIt explains the failings of the medical establishment to properly support neurodiverse people. It also offers a new way to think about autistic stereotypes and how to thrive in a difficult society whilst remaining true to your neurodiverse self.",
    "I bought this book to help me understand how my autistic teens experience the world. Now I'm rereading it to heal the probably-autistic child I used to be.\n\nRead this if you're autistic.\nRead it if you know someone who's autistic.\nRead it if you don't think either of the above things apply to you. (Because a) you're probably wrong, and b) understanding what makes this world hard for people helps us make things better.)"

    "This book was a blend of really good, concrete, logical concepts and kind of Woo-Woo, metaphorical, spiritual hogwash (from my point of view at least).\n\nI'm giving it 5 stars because some of the advice about finding your purpose, handinking relationship problems, and conquering your fears were amazing. However, discussions of energies and the Source and you being the One were a little too abstract for my liking.\n\nOverall, the book was great especially towards the beginning and it's worth sitting through the weird spiritual nonsense to get to the actually good advice.",
    "David Deidas writing will not be for everyone, it can be very poetic and metaphorical. Some of it I’m like this makes no sense. But for the most part it’s essential reading and opens your eyes to things that you never really knew you were curious. It’s all about state of mind and understanding what makes us guys guys. His exploration of the feminine and the masculine is incredibly interesting",
    "The book makes a lot of sense for the most part, some things are questionable though!",
    "This book definitely brought alot of things into perspective when it comes to a relationship of the strong masculine man and the soft feminine woman. This book definitely tough me how to cater to my soft feminine woman because quite frankly I didn't know how.",
    "If you want to be more masculine in life, this is a great book for you",
    "There are a few gems in here that are worth reading and reflecting on. Mostly, though, it's a bunch of unmanly frufru word salad that women love to hear. Of the 10 glowing reviews of this book that were put at the beginning of this book, at least 5 of them are from women - hopefully that's a red flag for men who are actually trying to reclaim and further develop their masculinity in an increasingly hyper-feminized world. His sections on sex read like 50 Shades of Gay, and are from a perspective that would never occur to a man, but rather one of these nu-males who is maliciously trying to convince women that he's sensitive and 'just gets it' in order to get laid. I don't know anything about David Deida, but judging from this book he's the guy at the party who brought an acoustic guitar and totally wasn't planning on bringing it out but there is this one riff that he's been working on while he's been going through a hard time in his life... but you don't want to hear any of that, do you??\nHis sections about feeling conflicted about work make me suspect he's never had a job, and is operating on the impressions he gets of professional life from watching chick-flics like 'Definitely, Maybe'.\nSection 13 opens with \"If a man never discovers his deepest purpose, or if he permanently compromises it and uses his family as an excuse for doing so.... A man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household\". Deida's got to make sure that everyone knows he's no misogynist or that he *gasp* believes there might be some merit to traditional gender roles. No sir! Because the superior man is, first and foremost, concerned with whether wamyn approve of him. (By the way, it's true that real men raise their kids. Definitely not other men's kids, though. Unless they are your kin and they lost their parents - you'd damn-well better look after your bloodline).\nI very much liked the first section regarding acknowledging that it never ends - you never get to that point where your ducks are in a row and now you can cleanly tackle that next event/chapter/endeavor in your life. It's now or never, son. Grab hold of your nuts and make it happen. Life is like baseball in that way, when you've already two strikes against you. Don't die waiting. Don't die watching.\nI think section 8 has a good message in there somewhere, but as with so much of the rest of the book, that message is lost in flowery word salad gobbledy-guk - truly masculine and healthy men don't think to talk like that - it doesn't occur to us because it is against our nature. If this book is for men, then it had better communicate like one: Directly, clearly, succinctly, and unapologetically (spell-check that for me). If a man wants to compose flowery language, he'll write a poem, and if he applies his mind it will be good or great. If he wants to save masculinity, he'll get the damn point across efficiently and not beat around the bush.\nHere's a funny part - section 7, regarding how your life's purpose MUST come before your relationship (I'm inclined to agree). \"The next time you notice yourself 'giving in' to your woman, postponing your mission and denying your true purpose in order to spend time with her, stop. Tell your woman that you love her, but you cannot deny your heart's purpose. Tell her you will spend thirty minutes (or some specific time) with her in absolute attention and total presence, but then you must return to carry on your mission.\" Did you catch that or is it just me? 'Honey? Dear? If I allow myself to be interrup... okay thirty minutes but then I TOTALLY am putting my purpose before you. Okay an hour but then seriously, honey...' Hey Deida, fire your editor for not catching that one. Unless your editor is a woman, then keep your head down... I mean, if that's ok with her, or whatever.\nThe truth is that as I write this, I've only gotten to section 13. I keep getting annoyed and putting it down. I promise I'll finish it, but I don't promise to like it. But there are likely one or two more good bits of advice in there somewhere so I must endure. This review contains more testosterone and rational thought than I've found thus far in this book about supposedly superior men, but let me leave you, dear review reader, with one last squirt of T before I wrap it up: Honor your ancestors, whoever they may be. You're ill-advised to allow yourself to be conquered by religious belief systems that are almost certainly incompatible with your genetic heritage - I'm not convinced that you believe that stuff and it makes me think you're a phony (looking at you, Northern Europeans spouting off about Karma and Nirvana); Love your woman, for sure. But it's on you to be a man that she can't NOT love. Remember, you're the prize, not her - don't fail at that. And I guess lastly, for now, I'll say that you ought to spend some time comprehending the fact that you've got the power to sculpt the world around you. If you don't think so, then your powers are weak. But fear not! They will grow in time, if you will them to.\nTry to find this book in the library and just do a quick skim through it.",
    "I am giving this book 4 stars. For myself, it is a 5 star book, but for men seeking enlightenment on the subject of women and relationships, do not expect to find \"answers\" here. The answers are in the practice of applying the concepts described in this book, and the book does not describe in detail exactly how to do that, and rightfully so, because such techniques cannot be taught in the pages of a book, they must be experienced first hand.\n\nDeida's work resides entirely within the concepts of polarity and energetics. These are things that are currently unmeasurable by scientific instruments, just as DNA and subatomic particles were not so long ago. If you are looking for clear cut scientific \"facts\" on the subject of men and women, then look elsewhere because you won't find them here. Deida's work is based on truths that you won't find in science for years to come, but if you do not require \"scientific facts\", and you are simply wise enough to look and feel inside yourself for what is true and what is not, Deida speaks more truth on the subject of men and women, relationships, polarity and love than any sect of Tantra, Yoga or any individual doctor, sex therapist, or pick up artist out there.\n\nWhen Deida talks about the feminine and masculine, he is purely talking about energy, NOT the physical body of a man or woman. The masculine energy is defined by traits, the feminine energy is defined by traits, and the polarity between the two creates a balance in which the entire universe sympathetically operates.\n\nIf the Big Bang is the purest form of the feminine essence, than gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes would be the purest form of the masculine essence. This relationship, the ying and the yang, the duality of the universe, has been present from the beginning of time, and is found in everything, especially within ourselves and our partners. Deida's work is to define these polarities so a man and a woman can simply recognize them for what they are and work with them as they wish. His work does provide solutions to create a definitive balance between the two, and these solutions are simply tools to keep your relationship absolutely delicious.\n\nBeing a man myself, I was initially resentful of the fact that in Deida's eyes, men are required to do all of the \"work\" in the relationship, while the woman expand into chaos. But when you truly understand the work and the teachings Deida is talking about, it becomes apparent that the woman's role in being absolutely vulnerable, carefree, and not defaulting to their own masculine mind due to a lack of trust in their man is equally as hard, if not harder than what the masculine is required to do.\n\nA woman can easily assume the role of the masculine energy, while the man assumes the feminine. It's actually very common in Western Culture today. As long as the polarity exists, the relationship will always be delicious, despite the ups and downs; it just requires hard work and daily practice from both partners to achieve it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been practicing Deida's work for a year. It's insane. The ability to literally recreate the feeling of having taken ecstasy simply by engaging your partner is well worth the discipline, or maintain full body orgasms for 30 minutes, 4 times a day isn't bad either.\n\nAnd what does it all add up to? Well, nothing. It's simply all for the sake of creating art through love while we're here. It's to be of service to others, to give our greatest gift, to experience love on a level very few people in their entire life will ever experience, and to die. There are no secrets to life buried in this book. You practice and serve your relationship, simply to experience love like it has never been experienced before.\n\nThis book is not a quick fix. You don't just read it and have all the answers. Honestly, if you read this book and try to apply some of the advice given, you will probably apply it incorrectly and it won't work because you will be missing the energetics involved. There is a teaching that needs to coincide with these words, that unless you seek those teachings and put them into practice, you won't find all that much value here besides an interesting read and possibly a doorway into a new kind of life style.\n\nThis path is a hard one, but it is real and it is powerful. Women will find themselves insanely attracted to you and often times, might not entirely know why. It usually starts with men breathing properly, standing properly, and keeping their mouths shut.\n\nIf you're willing to learn and actually apply the concepts in this book, and seek out the teachings that go with it, you will find fulfillment in your life and your relationship that transcends everything.\n\nSince getting involved in Deida's work, my girlfriend and I have dedicated every waking moment to it, and we have not looked back since.",
    "This book is awesome for covering the main external temptations and Internal Fires that a lot of guys experience. Money, Women, Love, Lust, Drive, Purpose, values, balance, energy, and even relationships. He does this all while speaking from a spiritual point of view. You'll also learn Feminine and Masculine Energy.",
    "I found about a quarter of this book to be excellent (mostly the beginning), and the rest seemed like the crazy ramblings of a sex-obsessed mad man!\nPersonally I would have found a slimmer book of the more sane and insightful parts of the text to have been more useful.",
    "I have been searching for a book like this for a long time. Many resources to aid men’s self-development provide sound, actionable advice but stop short of explaining the crux of the human situation. By combining Eastern spirituality (I recognise much from Vedic philosophy in this) and Western reasoning we have this wonderful amalgam utilising the best elements from many schools of thought. Reading this book gave me a physical high after contemplating on the wisdom being explained by Mr. Deida. I’ve also now realised the depth and beauty in the oft-mysterious and sometimes fearful (in her mystery) nature of women. This respect for the differing yet complementary qualities of the masculine and feminine, Shiva and Parvati, gives me renewed ambition to become a truly superior man. Thank you, David Deida.",
    "Bought it on recommendation from a friend. Wish I’d listened to myself and judged the book by its title. Yes, sometimes you can judge a book by its cover!\nThe whole book is this one guy just giving his sweeping claims and opinions (and he has a lot of them) and presenting them as fact without substantiating them in any way. Throw in a truckload of assumptions and you’re pretty much on the way.\nTo be fair, he does issue out a whole load of disclaimers at the beginning, and in my case (as someone who doesn’t want to get into a relationship) this book he says is not suitable. However if I was interested in a relationship I’d still find this book, and the audio presentation really, really annoying. He also gives out some really good advice such as “don’t wait for the perfect time to pursue your passion: start now”. And even that nugget is arguably worth the value of the book. But on the whole I wish I had spent my money on an audiobook that was enjoyable, instead of one that was profoundly irritating to listen to.",
    "Very insightful, great for people in relationships! Would not advice single people to read it. Would be like having a car manual with no car to apply it to.",
    "This book isn't gonna spiral you into a cult, nor is it going to push you to some forum or blogpost, its just gonna tell you some good mental models and ideas that can help any man, or dominant person (if we want to be Politically Correct) in a relationship.\nAlthough a bit wishy-washy and overly spiritual, all the chapters give a lot of good insight and information. Each piece of advice is timeless, once approached with a little critical thought, and the overall message in this book is a good one to have.\nMy only real criticism of the book is the broad generalisation of love. Love is used in a too broad way, sweeping all terms such as excellence, lust, greatness and love as well as one big word to be used to describe any positive action a Superior Man takes. Its not an inaccurate term, so to say, but it can be far to vague to describe some concepts in the book, which could leave some men a little confused if they don't or can't approach the content with a little interpretation of their own.\nRegardless, this a great Masculine Self Help book that you can throw at any guy and still get a good outcome. And if they say you're a misogynist for giving them this, well then there's no hope for that castrate."

    "Tuesdays with Morrie\n\nMitch Albom is a friendly sort of average insightful guy in regards to the Human Condition. And when we, mere mortals, out here read his works - it touches the average man/woman and young person with an intensity that makes us actually think and consider various inner convictions and ideals. I see no need to fill volumes of worthless pages with iconoclastic rambling rhetoric to relate such a simple story as this or please those with a self-righteousness condescension to anyone who likes them that makes their negative reviews completely suspect. To those who find it too simplistic to be meaningful it would seem they are among those \"useful idiots\" identified in recent literature.\n\nBefore hitting the send button...I usually sit and ponder the book holistically for its intrinsic value and effect on me and others that might be willing to give it a chance.\n\nAnd that is why I am completely taken aback by the negative reviews of the Albom books especially \"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" created by him and also how they compare that work to this one or this to another so poorly. It is just mind boggling how anyone can herald one with positive praise and then the other with negativism or treat both of them as miserable failures.\n\nAnd my lord, the extremes on these book reviews for this simplistic series of thought provoking submissions seem to go from Condemnation as if it were the words of Satanic himself - to the other extreme that Mitch's words are Angelic Music playing in some mystical background. Yet in truth neither is correct or `spot-on'.\n\nHis revelations are in no way negative but neither are they divinely found in the cosmos floating around like free spirited thoughts of Godlike omnipotent creatures that can be trapped with a butterfly net of Morrie's death. Certainly we can find these concepts and self-discovered truths throughout history and literature that he found near death - `everywhere' - and even in the pew book holders of our local churches; if we bothered any more to investigate that great guide to spiritual well being and the great light of truth. It is called \"The Bible\".\n\nBut if you do not like that - there are thousands of equally profound writings to be sure. But wow, can't some of these people just read a short story for what it is? My goodness, if one can find wisdom in a newspaper peanuts cartoon - or in Beadle Bailey or Garfield - surely one can give Mr. Albom some slack here!\n\nOf course most of the negatives are obviously political, anti-religious and socially engineering motivated haters, who are morally challenged, self-centered, jealous egotist of the left persuasion, or at least they would seem so. A in reverse the other side is too ready to praise a mere simple story of death as prophetic in nature.\n\nFor my part I am on the side of the Angels however because \"To be cursed by the devilish hate-mongers who seem to hate everything about this book, and Mitch or anyone else who puts their fingerprints on its pages - Is to be truly blessed\" in the words of `Kwai Chan Cane' in the old film \"Kungfu\".\n\nMost of us are in the middle of that \"pulling in opposite directions\" thing Morrie speaks of in the book. These Albom books are not classics, not epics nor are they the voice from the burning bush - for Pete's Sake. No one expects them to be...except the naysayers. I am no fan of the Oprah Winfrey minion squads who live and breathe on her every word or whim. Nor do I run out and buy her book recommendations. I did not even know until I read a negative review she had anything to do with it. And if you really want to attack someone for making a buck off of pain and suffering - try her and her buddy Dr. Phil!\n\nThese books do tend to take people to places where they do not want to go or fear to go - and they force them to go there if you give them a chance and read them through. They make you think of mortality, death, disease, deterioration of one's senses and flesh, of loss and tragedy and heaven and what comes after life and how we live, interact and conduct ourselves while here on this earth and if it is in its own simple way or through simple tales and stories...SIMPLE...so what?\n\nIn some cases they take us to places that find Morrie being a downright scoundrel in his younger years to one group - and a hero to another. Radicalism on one hand makes him into a fraud to the reality of fundamental truths and real intellectual civilized awareness and to honorable insight - and makes him look like an unprofessional buffoon. And yet on the other hand a driving force for social change in his own mind; some of it good and a lot of it bad from my read and his generation helped cause the destruction of civil society in the process.\n\nYet one senses that Morrie was simply human and had everyone else's flaws and weaknesses and he was almost like an \"Absent Minded Professor\" in some respects and in some of the chapters. And in one...he actually fit the bill where the author calls him \"Foolishly Naive\" in \"The Professor Part II\".\n\nBut this book and Albom's others are easy, enjoyable reads. Yes, saddening in a sort of good way - and fascinatingly thought provoking and interesting in others. This one challenges you inside and out to just step back and take a look at your own life, your actions and in actions and do what Socrates thought was so important in life; to do some Self-Examination when he wrote; \"The Unexamined life is not Worth Living!\" -\n\nThat great thinker set the stage for a great mental process - many hundreds of years beyond his own time for people like Mitch Albom and others - who would, on their own initiative, use these philosophies to give us pause in our present lives to make us question just what it is that drives us and what it is that is really the foundation of importance to each of our souls, spirits, everyday lives and for our individual well-being.\n\nIt is simply pure and unadulterated boulder dash, poppycock and simpleton rubbish to evaluate/review his books badly. The Neanderthals and hypocrites out there - need you to discard anything `heaven like' or `God Fearing' or `spiritual' and only accept a work that avoids these essentials, almost cowardly sometimes in heir manipulative intent to steer around any in depth discussion of these profound questions or force others to detour away from these subjects even when contemplating the mysteries of the Cosmos, the Universe, Life and what comes afterwards.\n\nThis work is simply - just as good and moving as its brothers or sisters I.E. \"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" or \"For One More Day\". It is not better, it is not worse, it is not superior in any way and it is not the most monumental epic story ever told! It is just a good book, a good tale, a good story and a book that makes you say, within your own heart, mind and soul -\n\n\"Wow, how would I spend my last days, weeks or months - if I had such a disease or knew my approximate day of death?\" And what will it be like - when - I in whatever form I become - float off into that hidden world of existence in realms beyond the skies?\n\nA magnificent assertion that Morrie was right about however is that - \"Most people do not want to discuss dying or they inwardly believe they are not going too!\"\n\nFor me the best chapter in this book was \"The Eighth Tuesday\" when they discuss the evils of - and the quest for money and power; because the exchange of a true loving hug of friendship is worth more than \"Gold Pressed Platinum\" or even the \"Power of that supercilious - Ted Turner\".\n\nI am reading all of this Author's works and they mean a great deal to my thought process recently and more to me now - as I have just survived my fourth major heart attack and did not expect to live through the ambulance ride to the hospital. So they are having a profound effect upon me; one and all.\n\nEach has a special meaning to me and each in a different way. And each has touched a nerve in my soul, my mind, my heart and my thinking and touched me in deep emotional ways. I will continue to read them all with joy and a smile and a questioning heart. I have many books on my shelves some intense, some long, some short like these. I find them all fascinating and always give the author the benefit of the doubt on usefulness.\n\n\"Tuesday's With Morrie\" has no more or less identifiable flaws in it - then do any other books from any other author. BUT I LIKE THEM ALL! And if the nay Sayers read them all and pick one over the other and call one dribble for mere politically partisanship, or special interest liberalized nonsense reasons or try to hate bait us into condemning any of them because one touches upon a forbidden idiotic progressive theme of God, country, patriotism, spirituality, religion or heaven or the afterlife - then shame on the reader for interjecting their prejudice, condescending attitudes, mentally and literary challenged minds into it.\n\nThis is pure and simply a good book! Other readers and reviewers may find this book moving or not but to say it is bad is simpleminded.\n\nThey are wonderfully written and I find benefit to all the themes of Mitch Albom's books. This one has you again wondering who Morrie would be in my life or better yet \"How many Morrie-like persons were there in my adventure in this world and this existence\"!\n\nAgain delightfully thought provoking and I thank the author for expanding my imagination, my intellectual pondering and for sharing his vision through Morrie about some of life's many questions - with the world.\n\n\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" - The best so far\n\"Tuesdays with Morrie\" - Second Best\nI am now already - \"For One More Day\".\n\nJPL",

The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\"\n\n\"Tuesdays with Morrie\" is one of the most beautiful book I’ve read in a long, long time. This book truly inspired me.\nThe author, Mitch Albom, narrates his series of weekly meetings with his Professor from his graduate days. Professor Morrie and Mitch have beautiful conversations on aging, death, money, emotions, family etc which impart life changing lessons. With each issue discussed, you feel a sort of connection with Mitch’s situation and thus Morrie’s lessons don’t end up becoming teachings to Mitch alone.\n\nThis book is much more than just a dying man's last words. It will put you on an emotional rollercoaster. And in this era of materialistic possessions, this book will bring you a little closer to life. It is simple, engaging and beautiful. In just 200 pages it says so much more than those 1000 page epics.\nIt will always be one of my favorite books.",
    "I’m just done reading this book, and this is one of those books where I find myself agreeing with the positive reviews and the negative reviews with almost equal enthusiasm. On one hand, you have a relationship between a student and his dying professor, who has seen life and its meaning, and who is ready shower the student with a lot of wisdom (so he can make millions off selling the book, maybe). You know, it is such an irony, where Morrie talks about money and how it shouldn’t be a priority in life when there are other more important things in life. And then there’s Mitch, picking the conversations, making a book, and making a fortune out of it. I find it really funny. It’s like creating a capitalistic empire by selling the ideas of Karl Marx in a book!\n\nAnyway, the way everything is described in the book seems like such an ideal world, where everything can be pasted on a greeting card and sold off. Everything is extremely dramatic and prolonged, and filled with clichés like ‘Love conquers everything’ (Oh really, I never heard that one before!)\n\nDefinitely, this book is ‘nice’. You know, that feeling of goodness, happiness mixed with a bit of sorrow, where you read things and the world seems like a better place because the words touch as they describe an ideal way of living, an ideal life, and defines the true meaning of life. Well, you get that feeling reading this book, right from the first page.\n\n‘Tuesdays with Morrie’ definitely encourages the reader to stop and think about what is important in life. However, I think it falls short in giving any new insights over the subject. It does tell you how to figure out life’s meaning or priorities for your own self, it will not help you in achieving that balance in life where you live like there’s no tomorrow, while simultaneously being aware of your future responsibilities.\n\nMorrie was a great guy, a nice guy. He has great things to say throughout the book. Almost half the book can be simply picked up and passed on as a profound quote against a beautiful background and would make up for a great greeting card. The book is not really a story, but more like a conversation between a student and his dying teacher. Many parts, where Morrie talks about the real meaning of life, about giving, about love, about sharing the happiness, it really touches your heart and you would definitely feel the emotion. However, the message from the first page is pretty simple and nothing new - “Surround yourself with loved ones and know what is important, and don't get caught with money and business. We have heard that a million times!”. Well, everybody knows that, nothing new.\n\nSome sections in the book, I did not like at all. For instance, Morrie’s views on marriage or having children. Well, these are things very subjective to each individual.\n\nSome of my favorite quotes from the book:\n- “Well, for one thing, the culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We're teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own. Most people can't do it.”\n- “Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone.”\n- “Don’t cling to things because everything is impermanent.”\n- “So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.”\n- “Life is a series of pulls back and forth... A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. Most of us live somewhere in the middle. A wrestling match...Which side wins? Love wins. Love always wins”\n- “This is part of what a family is about, not just love. It's knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame. Not work.”\n- “If you're trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down on you anyhow. And if you're trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. The status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone.”\n- “There is a big confusion in this country over what we want versus what we need...you need food. You want a chocolate sundae.”\n\nTo conclude, It’s a light read and a short book, you can pick it up and finish over a weekend. Some people will just love it, while more mature readers might think it otherwise. Cheers!",
    "This book has moved me immensely and its teachings will stay with me. I remember Mr Hillis, my form teacher for a mere two years, who was a Morrie sort. Even decades after leaving school, he is the teacher that I feel lucky to have had during two very important years As I headed towards my teenage years. As I age, I know that this is the type of book that I should be reading, to give me clarity in life. In this world of greed and lack of humanity, we need more Morries.",
    "This book is beautiful. The relationship between Mitch and Morrie is heartwarming, thought provoking and poignant. There discussions on love, death and family resonate, especially having lost my mum, this book validates the uniqueness of a loving relationship. It’s my go to book for comfort, reflection and confirmation of love during and after loss. I cannot recommend this book enough, irs truly special",
    "In this heartbreaking delivery of hope and acceptance, a terminally ill Professor with a debilitating disease is reunited with a former student in the final chapters of life.\n\nBoth learn to value friendship, to relish in the simplest delights in life and to seize the day while there is opportunity."

    "It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. \"Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life\" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one \"the best\". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.\n\nImpressing people without even meaning to is one of the earliest memories I have in life. After devouring all of the chapter and picture books I could get my hands on at pre-school age, my parent's classics and old science textbooks (or at least the ones I could reach off the bottom shelf) seemed the next natural step. Dad frequently retells a story in which he asks me as a toddler how I got to be so smart; I replied \"good genes\". Public school has no idea what to do with a kid who signs up for kindergarten being already able to read novels, play piano sheet music and execute batch files in DOS. I was tested at age 7 with an IQ of 163 upon entering the second grade, having already been skipped a grade ahead as well as being a year younger still due to having a September birthday. This conflict between being significantly younger than my peers at a critical age of development and also several standard deviations more intelligent than them was to be a continual source of strife. I begged and pleaded with my parents not to hold me back, not understanding the implications of being so much less emotionally mature than my peers. On the first day of class I got sent to the principal's office for taking my shoes off and refusing to put them back on. At 9, the teachers were fed up with me reading or drawing and 'distracting others' in class but also couldn't fail me when I was getting perfect grades, so I was pulled out and sent to a private school for the gifted, where after a year of constant boredom (diagnosed and medicated as ADHD) and other behavioral problems my teachers treated me as a class scapegoat and suggest that I be better off homeschooled or back in public school. These events marked the beginning of a long scholastic career of underachievement, contempt of authority, and befuddled administrators who weren't sure whether I belonged in the gifted program or Special Ed.\n\nI was lucky enough to be born into a white, middle class family in one of the most highly educated and prosperous parts of the United States. My parents were psychology majors who read all the right books and took all the proper steps in terms of nurturing the development of a gifted child without stifling or overloading me. So why am I not in the same percentile of overall life success as I am in test score range? Gladwell goes into the many statistical reasons why the high-IQ child is no more likely to become successful than any other child when demographic influences are controlled for, some factors as completely out of our control as being born in the wrong month of the year. He also gets down to what I believe is the true difference between successful and unsuccessful people, the willingness to work hard. If I had been self-disciplined enough to put in the hours academically to master unfavorable subjects with the same voracity with which I took to computers, art, music and reading, plus a less cynical attitude towards the school system, I might have gotten a full ride scholarship to any of the best universities in the world. As it is, I'll have to settle for a community college degree acquired at age 19, being published and owning my own business by 21, and knowing that if I do desire to learn a new skill at any point in life, the only thing standing in my way is myself. (Though, as a side note, I definitely pick up new skills a lot slower than I used to as a child and find myself stymied more often, indications that my IQ has dropped either from aging or drug/alcohol use, something that I try to compensate for with extra patience).\n\nThough it will always be embarrassing and awkward, I've gotten used to the incredulous stares and people asking \"how did you do that\", though I never had a particularly good answer. \"Lots of practice, the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time, and luck\" is the old standby, though it sometimes felt insincere. Now, thanks to 'Outliers', I realize that's not an overly humble explanation of genius. If I ever have kids, I will not subject them to a barrage of tests in order to find out exactly how \"special\" they are. I will accept that they are special simply on the virtue that they are them, listen to them to find out what they truly love to do and push them to achieve high but realistic expectations. And that's my advice for children of all ages - do what it takes to be whatever you want to be and do the hell out of it.",
    "After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.\n\nThe book is subtitled “The Story of Success”. The thesis is that a person does not achieve success by his or her own abilities, intellect or performance alone, although the 10,000-hour rule is applicable to achieve proficiency in any field. Other important contributors include the time of birth, the growing-up environment, cultural background, and, yes, luck. Most of us are aware of some, if not all, of these influencing factors. What Malcolm Gladwell did in “Outliers” was to tell the stories of how these factors played in the successes of a number of household names such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Robert Oppenheimer, as well as less well known names such as Bill Joy and Joe Flom. He concludes with the story of his own family, telling the reader that her mother, Joyce Gladwell, owes her college education to a series of lucky events. On the other side of the coin, he also told the story of Christopher Langan, whose IQ is similar to Albert Einstein and is regarded by many as well as by himself, as the smartest man in the world. “In his early years, while working as a farmhand, he started to read widely in the area of theoretical physics. At sixteen, he made his way through Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s famously abstruse masterpiece Principia Mathematica.” Yet Langan has yet to achieve any impact in the world because he did not have any support when he grew up. He is said to have written a manuscript entitled “Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU)“, in which he proves the existence of God, the soul and an afterlife, using mathematics. He could not find a publisher of a scientific journal for CTMU because the fact that he had only a year and a half of college worked against him. This is surprising, as I would imagine that the whole human race will be dying to learn his solution of the puzzle (whether God and afterlife exist) which has, since time immemorial, escaped the best scientific, philosophic, and religious minds.\n\nTo drive home the importance of cultural legacy, Gladwell presented a fascinating ethnic theory of plane crashes which should be of interest to folks who take to the sky frequently. There is also an interesting theory of why Asian students did well in mathematics compared to American students. Related to this is the way of expressing numbers and fractions in Chinese versus in English and why the former (Cantonese in particular) is superior.\n\nIn conclusion, a highly entertaining and informative book.",
    "Great book!",
    "Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.\n\nDespite being reported as being \"inspiring\" (it's literally on the front page), it's hard to see why. The book argues the point that success can be largely attributed to a person's circumstances. As most of these are out with anyone's control e.g. the time of year you are born, I struggle to see how anyone could be inspired. The best I can imagine is that someone will feel better that they were not the next success because of factors beyond their control.\n\nThe book tries to make its point by cherry picking studies and examples that will help prove his point. I found one response from authors of a study stating that they thought that Gladwell had misinterpreted and oversimplified their findings and I strongly suspect they were not alone. It presents a series of anecdotes and hypotheses as to why a trend was observed. My issue is that these hypotheses, that are all in keeping with the central theme of the book, are presented as if they were facts, when they are anything but. There is no attempt to give a balanced discussion, exploring arguments, studies or examples not in keeping with the oversimplified central point. Let's be clear, this method of starting with a point you want to make and then working backwards finding \"evidence\" to prove your view is journalism, not science. Gladwell can dress it up as much as he likes with statistics and citations, but don't be fooled, this is not how anyone with any scientific credentials works. Within a few pages I realised I was not reading a book by an expert in the field attempting to make their work accessible to the public, this was written by someone who could write a good story, but had little or no understanding of the scientific method. The book reads like an extended magazine article, perhaps not surprisingly as I was later to find out that the author is indeed a magazine writer.\n\nYou will not learn how to be successful by reading this book. You will not be better informed about what makes someone successful. At best this is a thought piece with a few discussion points worthy of a conversation at your next dinner party and others may enjoy the idea that they could have been as successful as The Beatles or as rich as Bill Gates if they had just been in the right place at the right time. Just a shame that it's not true. I didn't enjoy this book but more than that, I was incensed by it. This is journalism. A pseudoscience stretched out magazine article masquerading as an evidence based insight into success written by a modern day snake oil salesman who has bought into his own hype.",
    "​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, \"I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.\"\n\nWhile I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling.\n\nMoreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food?\n\nMy own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more.\n\nThe students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practising. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.)\n\nIn the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters.\n\n\"2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.\"\n\nFriday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, \"So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?\" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, \"YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started.\"\n\nThank you for your work Gladwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities).",
    "Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).\n\nThings I liked:\n\n- Interesting to read the stories of how various people came to success\n\n- Well written\n\n- Somewhat vindicating for those of us who already knew the dice were loaded\n\nReservations:\n\n- How is this a revelation? I felt a bit like this was written for people who are themselves pretty advantaged. If come from a lowly background, with little money or good social connections etc, you KNOW that these things disadvantage you, and you KNOW that those who get ahead, do so because of these advantages.\n\n- There was no follow through. I was expecting (and hoping for) a \"but if you don't have these advantages, you can still do X, Y & Z\". But there was nothing. So if you aren't advantaged, you end up feeling a bit flat at the end.\n\nSummary: Worth a read",
    "It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",
    "I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.\n\nLet's go back to a specific example. For instance, Gladwell points out the role of culture in airliner crashes; if aircrew come from cultures that have stronger deference to social superiors, maybe a copilot would shy away from challenging a pilot who'd made a mistake. He works through examples of Korean Airlines crashes that seem to fit this paradigm, and Korea is high up the ranking of countries by deference-to-superiors, and we hear about how Korean Airlines challenged that culture and then had fewer crashes. That's a good story to read! Problem is that we never really tackle the fact that the deadliest airline crash in history involved aircrew from a country which was at the opposite end of the ranking-of-countries. No doubt individual deference to superiors was a factor in that crash too, but CRM alone is pretty boring, people enjoy reading the different-places-different-cultures stories.\n\nI won't say it's all like this; I didn't get such a worry from the study of the backgrounds of lawyers in New York, for instance (maybe we'd see something different if somebody took on the Herculean task of expanding the study to different trades & different national backgrounds, but I don't think the main conclusion would shift much)."

It’s been a few weeks since I finished, and I still find their ideas impacting my life. I have to say, this book helped me overcome stress in a new way and I do feel better now than before I read it.",

    "Some of the material was familiar to me, but I like the feminist angle. Some of the writing style seemed a little odd to me, but I am pretty old!

I was viciously looking for help to overcome my emotional burnout and typed burnout into my Spotify and that’s where I listened to the authors, Amelia Nagoski and Emily Nagoski on the Benée Brown podcast, Unlocking Us. It was so amazing I immediately googled their book and bought it. Really did help understand stress, it’s cycle, and provides real life examples, journal prompts, and exercises. This book saved my mental health while I was in the depths of my burnout.",
    "I enjoyed the authors down to earth, somewhat humorous and clear communication. This book explains a lot of what we need to know to be healthy and at our best as human beings.",
    "Title says it all. I had a rough two years (like most through the pandemic) and trying to survive while managing grad school really wrecked me. This books is really helpful in resituating my stress and how I manage it. It's geared towards women but I don't think this book has anything that couldn't help men or NB people do the same. It's informational, has a narrative, and helps me realize that it's not just me having these experiences.",
    "Fantastic book with great advice on how to end the stress/trauma cycle and prioritise self care BUT I didn’t enjoy the one-sided perspective. As other reviewers have said, the contents could apply to men just as much to women. But instead the authors blame the patriarchy for the existence of the stress cycle. They mention the statistics of suicide attempts being 3* higher for women, but completely omit the fact that men are 2-4* more likely to complete suicide.\n\nAll genders have social ‘issues’ and complexities, but I am increasingly concerned with the socially-accepted emotional suppression for men. I felt like this book reinforced that. The authors seemed to imply that men’s problems can be summed up as wanting six pack abs or to last longer in sex. Thanks for contributing to the idea that men can’t have real problems.\n\nNow I am a cisgender woman, ie born female and identify as female, and I also identify as a feminist. AND yet I am so fed up of the male-bashing fest. Can we please see the ‘patriarchy’ as an outdated system (ok yep originally designed by rich white men) as something that doesn’t benefit many women OR men OR ANYONE these days? And can we please stop blaming each other for all of our woes.\n\nSo yes, great contents in theory, but I didn’t appreciate the blame game or the authors giving yet another other reason why men are always at fault.",
    "I would have given this book 5 stars, except Emily and Amelia are only talking to half the population. Yes many women have had life and choices (or lack of choices) and experienced hardship more then man over the year. Things are getting better but are not perfect yet, but as the ladies says everyone's experience is different and a whole gender should not be judged by the few or the worst examples of it.\n\nI disagree with the premise that woman are naturally more giving it nicer then men. Let's use the body shaming example in this book, notice it was the women doing this to other woman. This happens a lot to boys straight from primary school, I have 3 boys and every day atleast one of them have come back to tell me a mean thing the girls said to them about their appearance or even background.\n\nThe shame of all this gender biased book is if that was taken out I would agree with 90% of the research and ideas in this book. The practical ideas would work just as well for either gender. However I think many men might be put off reading it after the introduction. I would quite Bruce Lee and say\n\n\"Take what is useful, and disregard what is not\"\n\nThe reason being many of the ideas are very effective.\n\nThis is a great book of busting through the silent kill that is stress, if it was not so gender biased I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. I would say if you are going to put a book out to just half the population put it in the title before people buy the book.",
    "Utterly banal and derivative, poorly written, tedious long winded metaphors that are both confused and confusing! It seems like the authors want to communicate in a down to earth, even colloquial style, but this is all over the place, the quality of the research is lost in the poverty of the writing! As a former academic and now life coach of some 10 years I will concede I have read widely on this subject, however I am always interested in looking at the science and theory in new ways and learning new strategies to support myself and clients in the face of burnout. Sadly this book contributes absolutely nothing, its ultimately badly written with absolutely nothing new to say, unless you count making up new phrases for old well known concepts “human givers” anyone 🙄. For a moment I thought I was being a bit harsh until I just read a paragraph breaking down and explaining the concept of trust!!! So patronising its unbelievable, I wonder if they have any idea who their audience is? I am very, very surprised to read the odd good review, I can only imagine this field of self development is new to those readers and they are surprised and entertained by its style, perhaps it’s aimed at the young adult market for those who may one day become burnt out! I actually read some sentences out to my 19 year old son and we were laughing out loud at how poorly written and repetitive it is. From the content and marketing of this book I have seen elsewhere, I would assume the main target market is the fully adult female with some life experiences and time to get frazzled and burnt out under her belt, generally this market has already learnt/read a bit about this subject to and there is nothing new or of value in approach that this book can add. What this books wanted to achieve is beyond me. Really really dissatisfying and disappointing. The authors need to stick to conducting and whatever else their day jobs are!! I have to say it is probably the most badly written book I have ever read, and that really is saying something having read thousands of books in my lifetime! Avoid avoid avoid.",
    "I feel compelled to write my first ever book review, because I wish I had read the reviews properly instead of seeing 4.5 stars and assuming this would be a good self help book.\n\nIn all fairness, the book starts off really well. The authors talk about separating the stress from the stressor, how to actually completely the stress cycle etc. Then in the second section it just gets so weird. They absolutely ramble on for a third of the book about the patriarchy and feminism. Let me clarify, I hate the patriarchy and I am a feminist but it does not give any tangible advice for helping your stress and burnout, seemed like a total venting session. Not helpful at all.\n\nEven worse by the end of the book they tell you to think about your \"inner madwoman\". Just think about that for a second. Is it in any way healthy to refer to yourself as a \"madwoman\"? Most definitely not. I rushed through the end because I wanted to finish it but it was unbearable. There are heaps of great self help books out there, this one is not it so save your money. They continuously reference Disney movies which is great if you are between the ages of 5-10. I am not.\n\nOn a happier note I realised something positive about myself, that I can actually write a book! If these 2 can write such garbage, I could probably write a better book myself. No joke.",
    "As a woman I found this book to be sexist as well as quite juvenile. In their defence of the female experience in the western world the authors make it seem as though men have everything so easy. I’m tired of books and people treating men as though they are a different species. My husband is a kind, caring, affectionate man who is constantly doubting himself, and dealing with a lot of the stressors this books implies are unique to women. My heart aches for his struggle. We both struggle. That is being human. Books that make it seem as though these issues are unique to women are part of the problem.\n\nThe book is highly repetitive, does not include anything particularly unique. And the authors have renamed concepts that already exist in the psychological and self help literature as though they are revolutionaries. But these reinventions of already existing concepts are highly juvenile. “Bikini Industrial Complex” to label body image issues, your “Inner Monitor” to label expectation. “Human giver syndrome” to label the behaviour of putting others above yourself in all scenarios (often a trauma response, and one my husband struggles with more than myself). Even \"the stress cycle\" is just a renaming of the fight-or-flight reaction. Seriously, renaming things like this needlessly complicates the literature and is a pathetic attempt to make the concepts somehow new or original. If you want to read a real book regarding the serious impact of both personal and collective trauma, I recommend “When the Body Says No” by Gabor Mate. This book also has tips for listening to your body in order to avoid severe physical manifestations of stress like cancer, ALS and many others. Some of the tips are similar to those presented in this book (cry, rage out, exercise) but the overall tone and quality of Gabor Mate's book is much better and DOES NOT SEPARATE MEN FROM WOMEN. WE ARE ALL HUMAN."

    "* Note – I do not let political opinions affect my reviews. I am reviewing only the content; it doesn’t matter whether I agree with the politics of the author or not.\n\nThis book from cartoonist Steve Brodner collects images/drawings/doodles that he created every day for almost two years starting in March 2020. The images are mostly memorials to important and/or courageous people that died during the pandemic, but there are also many caricatures of politicians and public officials in a classic political cartoon style. You can get a good idea of the content by looking at the images above, or by using the “Look Inside” feature. Some of the images are in color, most are just simple black and white caricatures.\n\nI’m giving this 3.4 stars, because I think it is important that we remember some of these people that passed away during the pandemic. However, I wish that Brodner could’ve produced a book like this without the political commentary, because now many people on one side of the spectrum won’t even want to read this. Again, I don’t let specific political opinions affect my reviews at all, but I think it is unwise to alienate a large percentage of the population when you are trying to honor the memory of important, courageous people. If you really want to make sure that the sacrifices of these people aren’t forgotten, think of how many more people you could reach without the political cartoons. I understand that Brodner has been a political cartoonist for many years, but you could leave it out of just this one book, so that more people knew about these losses. Just my opinion, I wish there was less divisiveness and more unity in our country today.",
    "Love this book! It is everything it is advertised to be---Covid and political stories over 2020-22. Illustrations and comments that are poignant and also pointed! High praises for this book. I'm buying another to donate to our public library."

    "Humor comes from truth and promotes understanding. There are all sorts of neurobiological reasons for why laughing brings us together and makes us feel good. However the end result is the same --- when we laugh, we bond.\n\nJust because humor comes from truth, does not mean it is the truth. The Babylon Bee Guide to Democracy is not the full truth.... not even close and it doesn't pretend to be. It is satire and in that form it is brillant. The creators don't pretend to be neutral (milquetoast does not typically make for a great laugh). They clearly land in the solid abortion is murder camp and they aren't big fans of AOC but that is ok. There are plenty of comedians and satire sites that love to mock evangelicals and Ron DeSantis. I think they can all bond over loving puppies though.\n\nThose who fall on either side of the political spectrum can find humor in this Guide. If you are more on the Elizabeth Warren side of politics, you might find less humor. However at its core it reminds us that if we take ourselves too seriously --- we lose ourselves.\n\nI would absolutely recommend the Guide to Democracy. especially during election season. Although if you were to only read one Babylon Bee book, I would say go for their Guide to Wokeness.\n\nI thouroughly enjoyed the Babylon Bee's take on",
    "I was a print subscriber to The Onion long ago, and as its entertainment value waned I was delighted by the new arrival of the Babylon Bee. The Bee gives us something we need: cultural critiques blanketed in light-hearted merrymaking! Who says that the end of Western Civilization has to be boring? The Bee's coverage always gives me some encouragement even in the face of grim developments in the world.\n\nThis book is timely, and it captures perfectly the seemingly contradictory social mores and expectations that Americans deal with in 2022. More importantly, it puts them on full display for our ridicule in the form of infographics, bulleted lists, and in prose that makes fun of the mainstream, credulous newswriting seemingly drawn straight from the bottom third of the graduating journalism class. This book eviscerates the self-serious talking points du jour, and never has an evisceration been so light-hearted and upbeat!\n\nIf you love democracy, this book will help you have a few laughs while you watch democracy commit suicide. If you are skeptical of politics in general, this book sure won't do anything to talk you into trusting politicians or political people more than you do.",
    "The Babylon Bee Guide to Democracy is a definite\nrecommended read and is an on-point satirical look at our \"democracy\" in America. The creative minds at the BB take satire to the edge, where humor, irony and exaggeration truly meld with reality. That's satire at its best!\n\nThe 12 chapters discuss everything from the beginnings of American \"democracy\" to providing a glossary of \"democracy definitions;\" according to the BB of course. Eleven of the chapters include a chapter review to assist the reader in checking his/her \"comprehension for absolutely no reason\nwhatsoever.\" (pg 35) The graphics offer additional\nentertainment and understanding of our ever-bloated \"democracy,\" which is technically a constitutional republic, but I digress…and so do the authors in their introduction when they warn the reader not to let the fact that we're a\nconstitutional republic get in the way. (pg 2)\n\nThe Babylon Bee Guide to Democracy will make you laugh with some melancholy thrown in. It's a book written for this time in history, particularly before the 2022 midterm elections. Humor absolutely is the best medicine!",
    "Have you defined democracy lately? Know how it came to be? Remember your civics classes? How about all those old, white guys who planted democracy here in the 1700's? Bet you forgot that the revered Abe Lincoln founded the IRS. Or that John Adams predicted democracy would eat itself. Maybe you're not aware that a government Ponzi Scheme secures your retirement? There's a lot to remember and learn here. Democracy refuses to go gentle into that good night. But the Babylon Bee crew manages to find humor along this rough road that includes advice on rigging elections, protecting your \"stuff\" from the coveting government (or maybe even from IPA beer or non-binary persons). I'll bet you didn't know there is a political museum containing various artifacts, including the very flexible spine of a Supreme Court justice. There's a ton of clever artwork and pictograms, as well as \"word generators,\" that reward you with powerful insults you can use to support your low opinion of politicians and bureaucracies. If you like history and Tucker Carlson and enjoy humorous satire, you'll love this book. But if you don't vote, all is in vain.",
    "Babylon Bee’s new satirical tome on the topic of democracy and how to rig elections is not only timely in this period of mid-term elections, but is sure to send fans into fits of hysteria. Totally irreverent as usual, the thin line between fact and fiction in today’s electrified political environment is encapsulated in this entertaining guide that explains such truths as “Twitter, a platform for free speech as long as Twitter agrees with it.” Divided into 12 chapters, the reader will devour this book in one sitting and come away with enough knowledge on the three branches of government as well as everything they need to know about insurrections and constitutional rights to assist at the ballot box. Finally, Americans can understand the real differences among the political parties, according to the Babylon Bee, and why we Republicans love Mike Lindell!",
    "The best kind of satire slyly reveals the duplicity and failings of the great with a subversive nudge and a wink."

    "This book transcends categorization. It's exceptionally readable, but deals with complex topics. It's about psychiatry, but about storytelling. It will appeal to Aviv's New Yorker fans, but also to those unfamiliar with her work. It's a book about mental illness, about narrative, about culture, about ethics. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't love this book! I flew through it in a day!",
    "beautifully written, piercingly intelligent",
    "Helpful on the history of psychiatric treatment but the author does not venture an answer to the question of why some people “recover” from mental illness and some do not. It seems to me her theme of writing is common to many suffering from mental illness is inconclusive and she does not provide evidence for its efficacy if there is any.",
    "Strangers to Ourselves was a fascinating look into mental illnesses told through a series of anecdotes. We take a look into various illnesses, the racial biases in diagnoses and treatment, and even the writer's own experiences with her anorexia nervosa hospitalization when she was six and her use of Lexapro (an antidepressant) as an adult.\n\nI really enjoyed each section and would have been happy with an even deeper dive. The interviews were especially enlightening, and the book gave me a ton to think about by the time I finished. This is definitely an interesting, page-turning nonfiction choice!",
    "I did not finish this book due to formatting difficulties with NetGalley Shelf (which have nothing to do with the book except for the fact that it was very difficult, technically, to read). Nonetheless, kudos to Rachel Aviv for shedding insight on the effects of serious mental illness on individuals, family, and society, and for providing a broad and intriguing overview of the evolution of modern psychiatric treatment and practice. Her insights into the long hospitalization that were the norm not that long ago to the plethora of medications we have today to help people cope and be productive members of society without having to be locked up in a dismal institution.\n\nThe individual true stories, including that of her own hospitalization for anorexia at the age of six (!), reveal the breadth and depth of psychiatric disorders, including how cultural differences come into play in treatment. In one chapter, she discusses the case of Bapu, a woman from India, who believes she is the bride of Krishna, and frequently disappears on holy pilgrimages, only to be retrieved by her family and put into psychiatric care based on Western medicine. She is diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, a disorder very difficult to treat in Western culture, takes medication on and off and returns to her “normal” self until she feels gripped yet again by her firm belief that her house is cursed, which sets off her delusional wandering yet again. Clearly, her behavior is erratic in terms of consensual reality. But is it really erratic? Or is she a person so deeply entrenched in the mystic elements of her culture that in those circles her behavior is accepted?\n\nI think about our definitions of normal and reality (that is, the consensual reality a majority of the population accept as normal) and wonder if adhering only to that definition is the only way to look at human behavior. One only has to talk to a person with schizophrenia using that person’s vocabulary to realize that norms are narrow and that broadening one’s horizons to courageously understand differences can only enhance relationships.\n\nWas that the point of the book? Probably not. Actually, at times I wondered what the point was, until I stepped back and understood it as a psychosocial overview of psychiatric disorders and treatments, which, overall, was fascinating.",
    "Rachel Aviv has long been one of my favorite writers and this book does not disappoint. Her voice is endlessly compassionate, nuanced, and brilliant. Her focus on highlighting subjects from various communities and backgrounds emphasizes the complexity of psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and the dangers of a single white, Western patriarchal lens on psychological wellness. If only all writers and practitioners of psychology had the same compassion and discernment. This book has the potential to change lives and impact the field. I hope it does.",
    "Rachel Aviv's STRANGERS TO OURSELVES is that most rare of books, casting a whole new light and prism through which to view our assumptions and presumptions about those who suffer from mental illness. Aviv's exquisite talent for respecting the stories of others and illuminating the experiences of those in the throes and those attempting to be their own truest selves without labels, medicine, and checkbox expectations informed and moved me throughout this important, timely, and marvelous book. I received an early copy of this book and these thoughts are my own, unbiased opinions.",
    "Unless Shakespeare gets resurrected form the dead and writes another play, no kindle book is worth $15.00. The paperback will come out and it will be cheaper. Wait a little longer and the hard backs will cost $5.00. I've been a very good Amazon Kindle customer for years but hear me when I say that ends now. Greed, pure and simple from a bald guy who thinks he's an astronaut."

    "I really enjoyed this book. For every book, no matter how great, there's always critics or things that don't appeal to some. I'm glad I didn't let those opinions stop me from purchasing this.\n\nEven prior to beginning a new relationship recently (my first one in several years after taking time for introspection and personal growth), I've been heavily interested in psychology, esp on relationships/sex. I've read many books on the subject, including at least one other by John Gottman, and still found this book well worth the read. It covers what I believe really are the key conversations that can make or break a healthy, happy, satisfying relationship, and provides a great variety of examples and scientific research for each area of focus. There's short exercises that help individuals get thinking about the topics at a deeper personal level prior to each date which helps make the dates themselves more productive and connective. There's also great instructions and tips, not just on how to keep each conversation positive, healthy, and even fun, but also how to communicate effectively in general. Many are simple things that I'm sure we've all heard at some point—active listening by making eye contact, rephrasing back, and asking questions; keeping an open, non-judging mindset; being kind and understanding to each other; etc—but are summarized together very succinctly and efficiently. The dates themselves (i.e. the topics of focus) are, imo, very thoughtfully laid out as far as order and build well. For example, date 1 begins with Trust & Commitment, a foundation that is necessary in order to make the following dates that cover more sensitive subjects (such as money/work and sex) successful.\n\nAdditional highly important key points to happy relationships are emphasized throughout the book, such as cherishing each other, showing kindness, and focusing on positive, which align perfectly with my own experience and other research, yet are often overlooked or greatly undervalued by most couples. I appreciated this. I also appreciated that it was stated (and backed with examples/research) that aside from a few specific aspects (such as wanting children or not), differences in couples, such as interests and certain beliefs, does not corelate with level of happiness and satisfaction, and WHY, as well as tips on HOW to connect in these situations. This has been a fear of mine in my own relatively new relationship that is otherwise the happiest, healthiest one I've ever been in and truly see being a lifelong partnership; so I felt so grateful to read this.\n\nI loved that the authors also included small actions that can be immediately implimented. Kissing each other goodbye, finding small ways to show appreciation, committing to a dedicated time to be with each other each week, etc. Again, this is likely not new info for anyone who's read other relationship books but I still found it very well said and still found new takeaways in each chapter.\n\nI could go on. Highly recommend this book. Whether you're single, newly relationed, or have been together for years, I think everyone could gain something from this book.",
    "I like the questions that are asked for each other to answer and that you do it at any phase of your dating, relationship, or marriage.

    "Come for the serial killer, stay for the fair.\n\nI will be absolutely honest and admit that I purchased the book because I was interested in the weird story of H.H.Holmes, American con-man, psychopath and serial killer. In fact, I will add to my confession, and shame, by saying that my interest was sparked by watching the episode of Timeless - a series unlikely to be renewed - where our trio of intrepid time-travelers goes back to the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition and have a misadventure in the \"murder castle.\" I've never read anything by Erik Larsen before, but I know that he has a good number of books on the history section shelves and I’ve seen this book in passing for years.\n\nI listened to this as an audiobook, and my initial reaction was that there was an awful lot about the 1893 World’s Fair, especially the architecture of the World’s Fair, than I was expecting or interested in. Frankly, my initial reaction was that all the detail about the planning of the Fair was getting in the way of the interesting bits about H.H. Holmes.\n\nHowever, about half-way through the book, I found my interest shifting as I was sucked into the world of the Fair and the strangeness of the world right on the cusp of becoming the world we know, with lights and Cracker Jacks and Ferris wheels, but still possessing the instincts and customs of a more genteel and trusting age. I found that people like Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham were becoming my heroes.\n\nLarsen structures his book as alternating narratives. One narrative follows the twisted path of Holmes; the other follows the life of the fair. There is no doubt that the Holmes’ narrative starts out in the lead because of the natural human interest in evil, and Holmes was evil. Larsen describes Holmes as America’s first serial killer in an age when the language did not have the term “serial killer” to describe Holmes. Holmes was born Herman Webster Mudgett in 1861, studied medicine, married and abandoned his first wife, and, then, took the test for a pharmacy license under the name of H.H. Holmes and made his way to Chicago. In Chicago, he bought a pharmacy from a widow, who he probably conned, married a second wife, deposited the wife and his child in a suburb of Chicago, and then came up with the idea of transforming land he had purchased into a hotel in time for the upcoming Fair.\n\nListening to the Holmes’ arc, two thoughts come to mind: first, he was psychopathic and, second, he didn’t seem to understand how ridiculous his ideas were. For example, after scamming a brother in law, his plan to avoid discovery was to push the brother in law off of a roof. Who today would think such a thing would not be immediately seen for what it was? Likewise, Holmes built a hotel with secret rooms and gas lines to those rooms so that he could gas patrons, kill them and rob them. Women were constantly disappearing from his hotel, leaving their things behind. When the widow he bought his first pharmacy from simply disappeared, Holmes explained that she was visiting California. He courted and wed multiple wives simultaneously. His method for making bodies disappear was to have the bodies rendered into skeletons and then he would sell the skeletons to medical colleges.\n\nToday, who could be so naive as to expect that any of this would not be discovered or noticed?\n\nAnd that is partly the point. The era was a moment of transition. In the small towns that most people had lived in prior to the 1890s, everyone was under everyone’s else’s supervision. In Chicago, however, the rules changed. People were anonymous and alone in a crowd. People were easy to lose in a world without phones or extensive police agencies. If someone went to California, it would take more than idle curiosity to locate them. It was a psychopath’s utopia.\n\nAlso, the casualness of death becomes apparent in Larsen’s book. For example, Burnham’s partner plunges into the October night and dies of pneumonia within a week. Larsen also describes how the sister of one of Holmes’ victims suddenly took sick and died within a week. She was probably poisoned, but in that age it was not hard to believe that a healthy woman in her twenties could die of a sickness so quickly. I was working on a train accident fatality lawsuit during the time I listened to this book, so this passage had some significance to me:\n\n// Anonymous death came early and often. Each of the thousand trains that entered and left the city did so at grade level. You could step from a curb and be killed by the Chicago Limited. Every day on average two people were destroyed at the city’s rail crossings. Their injuries were grotesque. Pedestrians retrieved severed heads. There were other hazards. Streetcars fell from drawbridges. Horses bolted and dragged carriages into crowds. Fires took a dozen lives a day. In describing the fire dead, the term the newspapers most liked to use was “roasted.”//\n\nIn Fresno County where I live, which is a mostly rural county with a large urban population, there are only two unprotected crossings – without signals – in the entire county. The three people killed in this one accident was probably higher than the annual average for the last fifty years. Violent death was simply more common in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, Larsen presents the “White City” of the Fair as the world that was dawning. The Fair brought millions of visitors to a location with lights and cultural diversity and sanitation and police protection. The idea that the architects are the heroes of the book seems strange since architects rarely play the role of hero, but Larsen manages to invest tension throughout the story arc about the Fair. Thus, there is tension in whether the architects will get the Fair built in time, and then there is tension about whether the Fair will turn a profit in the face of the economic depression gripping the country. There is also the heroism of George Washington Gale Ferris and his eccentric idea of building a huge wheel that would carry “Pullman Car-sized” boxes for passengers, although the most heroic act of the book, I thought, was the willingness of Mrs. Ferris to ride the thing on its maiden voyage as a rain of extra bolts cascaded down from the structure.\n\nI came to know and develop a liking for Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New York’s Central Park. Burnham is forgotten today but contributed to many American cities.\n\nMy first term paper in history was one I wrote as a Junior in High School about Eugene V. Debbs and the Pullman Strike of 1894, so it was something of a home-coming for me to read about the events that were occurring just before that strike, and to think that Debs and Darrow probably visited the Fair, maybe they ran across Holmes and Burnham. It occurs to me now that the Pullman Strike of 1894 was in 1894 because the closing of the Fair in 1893 exacerbated the economic crisis. Larsen writes:\n\n// Ten thousand construction workers also left the fair’s employ and returned to a world without jobs, already crowded with unemployed men. Once the fair closed, many thousands more would join them on Chicago’s streets. The threat of violence was as palpable as the deepening cold of autumn. Mayor Harrison was sympathetic and did what he could. He hired thousands of men to clean streets and ordered police stations opened at night for men seeking a place to sleep. Chicago’s Commercial and Financial Chronicle reported, “Never before has there been such a sudden and striking cessation of industrial activity.” Pig iron production fell by half, and new rail construction shrank almost to nothing. Demand for railcars to carry visitors to the exposition had spared the Pullman Works, but by the end of the fair George Pullman too began cutting wages and workers. He did not, however, reduce the rents in his company town. The White City had drawn men and protected them; the Black City now welcomed them back, on the eve of winter, with filth, starvation, and violence.//\n\nHolmes’ story closes out with Holmes’ finally getting tripped up in an insurance swindle and an intrepid Pinkerton detective following the clues to prove that Holmes was a child-killer among his other sins. In that way, Holmes’ story arc concludes as a true crime story about a true crime story.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed and learned from this book, I would have to pick a nit with the “fictionalization” of some of the narrative. Larsen tells us that everything in his book is supported by documentary evidence, but he also acknowledges that he has made reasonable inferences about what happened at times. I think his inferences are reasonable, and I credit him for acknowledging what he has done, but I think that there are times when he offers his insights into what various people were thinking or feeling that he has gone too far and stepped outside of history proper into fiction. Obviously, this book is intended for the mass market and must keep reader interest. Also, we are a long way into non-fiction novels at this point, but there are moments when I as a history reader was woken up by Larsen describing what a character felt (when I would probably never have objected to the same information being couched as something the person “might have thought,” so if you interpolate those words, the book is in the genre of history.)\n\nIn sum, don’t be confused; this is not a true crime story. It is a sociological history/novel about a particular time in American history. Your interest in this book will vary depending on whether you are buying it as “true crime” or as history.",
    "“I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing” –H.H. Holmes\n\n“Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men’s blood” –Daniel Burnham\n\nErik Larson opens his book with these two quotes that function as a preview—and microcosm—to the essence of the two minds at the heart of his Devil in the White City. More than that, both men operated within the same city that spurred their minds to blossom in all their respective depravity and grandeur: Chicago. And more specifically, the author examines the single event that acted as the crucible for revealing both the best and worst that these men could conjure—that event being The Chicago World’s Fair of 1893—an event that would serve as a symbol to the spectrum of the human spirit in all its glory and monstrosity upon the advent of the twentieth century.\n\nChicago of 1893 was a burgeoning American city determined to demonstrate itself against its metropolitan rivals to the East. And with the national decision to commemorate Columbus’ 400th anniversary—coupled by the renowned debut of Eiffel’s Tower at the recent Paris Exposition of 1889—America needed to utilize the upcoming Chicago World’s Fair as a monument and announcement to American’s unparalleled capacity for achievement and innovation.\n\nLeading this endeavor would be Daniel Burnham—the architect responsible for overseeing its exhibits, maintaining production, and selecting the fellow men responsible for elevating the Fair into a phenomenon surpassing all expectations. After the death of Burnham’s professional partner, celebrated architect John Root, almost the entire burden of the assignment fell upon his shoulders. a task with the potential to cripple most men faced with the challenge, but one in which Burnham would work tirelessly to succeed—despite certain failures and shortcomings often out of his control—to exemplify the power of a determined mind coupled with an unceasing work ethic.\n\nThese obstacles of Burnham’s contention would often arrive in the form of inclement weather, bureaucratic battles, and internal squabbles with fellow department heads. Nonetheless, despite numerous delays and last-minute fixes, the Fair was a triumphant success. One that would leave behind such marvels as The Ferris Wheel, Tesla’s alternating electrical current, gum, shredded wheat, spray painting, the device that creates plates for printing Braille…the list goes on ad nauseam. But besides these tangible heirlooms still affecting present American society, the ambition and awe of by the Fair itself would prove to be perhaps its most profound legacy.\n\nAs one example, Larson relays an anecdote concerning one of the countless construction workers hired to help the Fair reach its nearly impossible deadline. This construction worker being an otherwise anonymous employee by the name of Elias Disney, who would recount stories of the overwhelming awe instilled by the spectacle of The White City upon the attendees to his young son Walt, which, Larson implies, would later be imitated in his designs of Disneyland.\n\nInterspersed between these anecdotes of American achievement at its zenith, Larson weaves a parallel narrative focused upon the exploits of H.H. Holmes—America’s first true serial killer. Operating his nearby World’s Fair Hotel—which would later be infamously remembered as The Murder Castle—Holmes would seize upon the opportunity afforded by the Fair in the most monstrous manner imaginable: as a vehicle for his plans of murder and theft to be unleashed.\n\nIn stark juxtaposition to Burnham’s continued efforts to utilize his resources for the benefit of society, Holmes embodied the nightmare version of the American self-made man. Calculated, cold, and patient, Holmes worked with methodical ingenuity in his construction of the Murder Castle: a three-story hotel assembled from Holmes’ designs that would provide the perfect tenement to his abominable ambitions.\n\nFrom assigning certain workers to only certain sections (limiting their knowledge to corroborate with one another), to his ability to charm creditors for money that would never be repaid, to his own manufactured public image of a well-to-do businessman that would attract his varied women of interest, Holmes exploited every conceivable aspect of the trusting American public in order to appease the commanding vices surging within him.\n\nThese vices would be numerous and varied. From insurance fraud, to theft, to murder, to kidnapping, Holmes existed as a personification of evil. At every turn—with Burnham working relentlessly mere miles away to produce a vision of America that would change and inspire the world—Holmes indulged in every act of depravity that he could conceive. As though possessed (a claim that Holmes would literally attest to after his arrest), H.H. truly lived up to his opening quote of being incapable of quelling his deviant impulses. Whether it was his numerous wives—all naïve women who sought out Chicago in hope of a new life within the burgeoning metropolis—or random hotel guests, or eventually the children of his accomplice…Holmes exhibited no mercy in satisfying the limitless depths of his immorality.\n\nAnd, as Larson reminds the reader in the introduction, the book is not a work of fiction. Nonetheless, the author weaves this sprawling narrative with compelling and compulsive chapters—each one short and episodic so that the reader falls under the trance of believing that the work could be a fictional, historical thriller. More importantly and impressively, these chapters are written with such specificity and atmosphere as to completely transport the reader into the setting. Larson favors stark, smooth prose that paints a vivid picture of the subject and allows the reader to experience the range of emotions occurring within this revolutionary event: from the majesty of the Court of Honor to Annie Williams’ utter panic after Holmes locks her within a vault, turns on the valve for poisonous gas to be released, and listens to her final screams before death just outside the door.\n\nThe last third of the novel—with the Fair inexorably approaching its bleak end and the determined detective named Frank Geyer on Holmes’ elusive trail—Larson escalates the suspense to especially memorable and powerful effect. After Holmes’ many, many creditors finally coalesced to take him down, H.H. escaped from Chicago.\n\nHowever, the hotelier did not flee alone; instead, he absconded with three children belonging to his former assistant: the drunken henchman Benjamin Pitezel. As Geyer tracks Holmes across the northern states, locates him in Toronto, and discovers the gruesome remains of the children murdered and mutilated by Holmes, the storytelling morphs into a riveting chase across America and Canada to finally deliver retribution upon the killer. Geyer’s descent into the cellar of the climactic Toronto home reads with as much suffocating suspense and dread as any horror novel, and the brutal aftermath—wherein the mother must identify her horribly mutilated child at the coroner’s office—delivers the unbearable emotions of devastation experienced by the victim that are often glossed over by similar works in the genre.\n\nBy the finale, wherein Larson interweaves the rapid destruction of the Fair following the assassination of Chicago’s mayor with Holmes’ arrest and execution, the author provides perspective on how the immense scope of these events affected the American public. Burnham with the World’s Fair—a prodigious monument to the power of accomplishment in American creativity, innovation, and inspiration; then with Holmes and the Murder Castle—a material edifice containing the darkest conceptions of a man’s mind and a literal house of horrors that contributed nothing but carnage and chaos.\n\nIn this striking juxtaposition, Larson underscores how these two men—existing under the same time, place, and tested by the same opportunity—opted to forge the material legacy of their lives. And in demonstrating these expanded boundaries of American accomplishment and depravity upon the advent of the twentieth century, Larson impresses a larger understanding of the scope of human nature; and more importantly, the significance of how each man chooses to actualize his own nature, despite his limited time, and how profoundly the consequences of these actions continue to echo beyond the ephemeral present.\n\n[...]",
    "I read this book for one of my book clubs as a true crime story. But it was so much more than that. The identity of the killer was known from the start, which was not a problem. The real focus of the book was on the building of The White City, aka the the 1892-93 World's Fair held in Chicago, but on the individuals involved in the design and creation of the fairgrounds, which were indeed a city. The killer is one of many incredible people involved in the design, creation, and success of the fair and its impact on their lives, careers, and death. I learned more than I expected about both Chicago and the many prominent people involved with the fair: Daniel Burnham, Frederic Law Olmsted, George Ferris (guess what he became famous for), to name a few. And not forgetting the killer and the hunt to find proof to arrest him for his crimes undertaken by a determined, tenacious police detective. Not for everyone, but if you are interested in social history, this is well-worth reading.",
    "If you want to read substantially about H. H. Holmes, this is not the book for you. Over two thirds of the book is dedicated solely to the World's Fair, with chapters relating to it long and sprawling while those relating to H. H. Holmes are short and barely sprinkled throughout.\n\nThe writing itself is needlessly pompous and includes boring examples of the architects dinner menus and what they drank from the bar.\n\nThe book relies on description to convey everything and as such is as repetitive as it is dreary. While the spartan chapters on Holmes may thrill you, the lengthy and numerous chapters on the World's Fair will bore you through repetition and, at times, fractured prose. I was disappointed with this book.",
    "This book is way more about the world's fair than it is about H.H. Holmes.\n\nIt literally dedicates space to writing about the conditions of the soil that the fair was to be built on, and what other sites they looked at to find a site for the fair. Honestly, who cares. Even if you are hugely curious about the fair, most of it will send you to sleep.\n\nThe stuff about H.H Holmes is interesting, but you're mostly reading about the architects and what they had for dinner. I have no idea how this book has positive reviews.",
    "As always with Larson the pleasure is in the detail, these little stories of history that hide behind the main tale... the building of the great Exhibition and Burnham's challenges come alive , and tbe birth of the Ferris Wheel or the success of Buffalo Bill as a showman are a real treat to the reader...as for HH Holmes, Larson has used what knowledge is available about the man and his sad endeavours without speculating further, or sensationaling his deeds. A fair story of the first serial killer understood as such in America and especially a good account of the detective who went out of his way to bring the truth about Holmes. One wish Larson had developed it further. Not as captivating as some of his other works but a good account of Chicago's life under the influence of these two very different men.",
    "I bought this book to read about H.H. Holmes but unfortunately the vast majority of it is about building the World's Fair. It is well written and an interesting read but buy something else if you just want to read about H.H. Holmes."

    "Isabel Wilkerson is an American journalist and author, who in 1994---while the Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times---won the Pulitzer Prize in journalism (the first African-American woman to do so). She has also taught at Emory, Princeton, Northwestern, and Boston University.\n\nShe says of this 2020 book, “I embarked upon this book with a … desire to … better understand how all of this began in the United States: the assigning of meaning to unchangeable physical characteristics … that defines and directs politics and policies and personal interactions. What are the origins and workings of the hierarchy that intrudes upon the daily life and life chanced of every American? That had intruded upon my own life with disturbing regularity and consequences?... I discovered, while working on ‘The Warmth of Other Suns,’ that I was not writing about geography and relocation, but about the American caste system, an artificial hierarchy in which most everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like and that manifested itself north and south… For this book, I wanted to understand the origins and evolution of classifying and elevating one group of people over another and the consequences of doing so to the presumed beneficiaries and to those targeted as beneath them… While this book seeks to consider the effects on everyone caught up in the hierarchy, it devotes significant attention to the poles of the American caste system, those at the top, European Americans, who have been the primary beneficiaries, and those that the bottom, African-Americans, against whom the caste system has directed its full powers of dehumanization.” (Pg. 27-28)\n\nShe observes, “We in the developed world are like the homeowners who inherited a house on a piece of land that is beautiful on the outside, but whose soil is unstable loam and rock… cracks patched but the deeper ruptures waved away for decades, centuries even. Many people may rightly say, ‘I had nothing to do with how this all started. I have nothing to do with the sins of the past. My ancestors never attacked indigenous people, never owned slaves.’ And, yes. Not one of us was here when this house was built. Our immediate ancestors may have had nothing to do with stress cracks and bowed walls and fissures built into the foundation. We are the heirs to whatever is right or wrong with it. We did not erect the uneven pillars or joists, but they are ours to deal with now.” (Pg. 16)\n\nShe explains, “Caste is the infrastructure of our divisions. It is the architecture of human hierarchy, the subconscious code of instructions for maintaining, in our case, a four-hundred-year-old social order… A caste system is… a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of others groups on the basis of ancestry and often immutable traits… A caste system uses rigid, often arbitrary boundaries to keep the ranked groupings apart, distinct from one another and in their assigned places.” (Pg. 17)\n\nShe continues, “Race does the heavy lifting for a caste system that demands a means of human division… Caste, like grammar, becomes an invisible guide … to how we process information… We may mention ‘race,’ referring to people as black or white or Latino or Asian or indigenous, when what lies beneath each label is centuries of history and assigning of assumptions and values to physical features in a structure of human hierarchy. What people look like, or, rather, the race they have been assigned or are perceived to belong to, is the visible cue to their caste… Caste and race are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. They … serve to reinforce each other… Race is what we can see… Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place. Caste is fixed and rigid. Race is fluid and superficial, subject to periodic redefinition to meet the needs of the dominant caste in what is now the United States… the subordinate caste, too, has been fixed from the beginning as the psychological floor beneath which all other castes cannot fall… The use of inherited physical characteristics to differentiate inner abilities and group value may be the cleverest way that a culture has ever devised to manage and maintain a caste system.” (Pg. 18-20)\n\nShe clarifies, “I use language … to suggest a new way of understanding our hierarchy: ‘Dominant caste’ … or ‘upper caste,’ instead of… ‘white.’ ‘Middle castes’ instead of… ‘Asian’ or ‘Latino.’ ‘Subordinate caste’… ‘bottom caste’… instead of ‘African-American.’ ‘Original’ … or ‘indigenous peoples’ instead of … ‘Native American.’ ‘Marginalized people’ … instead of, women of any race, or minorities of any kind.” (Pg. 29)\n\nShe recounts, “The [early American] colonists made decisions that created the caste system long before the arrival of the ancestors of the majority of people who now identify as Americans. The dominant caste controlled … when, and if a black person would eat, sleep, reproduce, or live. The colonists created a caste of people who would by definition be seen as dumb because it was illegal to teach them to read or write, as lazy to justify the bullwhip, as immoral to justify rape and forced breeding, as criminal because the colonists made the natural response … to defend oneself or break free---a crime if one were black.” (Pg. 48)\n\nShe identifies eight ‘pillars’ of caste, including ‘Divine Will and the Laws of Nature,’ ‘Heritability,’ ‘Endogamy,’ ‘Purity and Pollution,’ ‘Occupational Hierarchy,’ ‘Dehumanization and Stigma,’ ‘Terror as Enforcement,’ and ‘Inherent Superiority versus Inherent Inferiority.’” (Pg. 99-166)\n\nShe acknowledges, “Modern-day caste protocols are less often about overt attacks or conscious hostility and can be dispiritingly hard to fight… It is not about luxury cars and watches, country clubs and private banks, but knowing without thinking that you are one up from another based on rules not set down in paper but reinforced in most every commercial, television show, or billboard, from boardrooms to newsrooms to gated subdivisions to who gets killed first in the first half hour of a movie. This is the blindsiding banality of caste.” (Pg. 212) Later, she adds, “The caste system thrives on dissension and inequality, envy and false rivalries, that build up in a world of perceived scarcity. As people elbow for position, the greatest tensions arise between those adjacent to one another, up and down the ladder.” (Pg. 239)\n\nShe argues, “For a range of complex reasons, some leading African-American social scientists of the early to mid-twentieth century objected to [Allison] Davis and others applying the notion of caste to the plight of African-Americans, even as they were living under one of the purest forms of it in American history… they did not want to give credence to the possibility that the system might indeed be closed forever. If their status was seen as a fixed one, there might be no hope of rising above it. They were deep in a caste wilderness, before ‘Brown v. Board of Education,’ before the Montgomery bus boycott, before the 1963 March on Washington and the civil rights legislation of the 1960s that would formally prohibit the caste restrictions they were then living under. In the middle of the twentieth century, no one could have dreamt of a member of the subordinate caste sitting on the Supreme Court… being in the Oval Office as president rather than as a butler.” (Pg. 253)\n\nShe states, “One cannot live in a caste system… without absorbing the message of caste supremacy. The subordinated castes are trained to admire, worship, fear, love, covet, and want to be like those at the center of society, at the top of the hierarchy.” (Pg. 289)\n\nShe concludes, “A caste system persists in part because we, each and every one of us, allow it to exist… If enough people buy into the life of natural hierarchy, then it becomes the truth or is assumed to be. Once awakened, we then have a choice. We can be born to the dominant caste but choose not to dominate. We can be born to a subordinated caste but resist the box others force upon us… The goal of this work has not been to resolve all of the problems of a millennia-old phenomenon, but to cast a light onto its history, its consequences, and its presence in our everyday lives and to express hopes for its resolution… Caste is a disease, and none of us is immune… the United States is facing a crisis of identity unlike any before. The country is headed toward an inversion of its demographics, with its powerful white majority expected to be outnumbered by people not of European descent within two decades.” (Pg. 380-381) Later, she adds, “In a world without caste, being male or female, light or dark, immigrant or native-born, would have no bearing on what anyone was perceived as being capable of… We would see that, when others suffer, the collective human body is set back from the progression of our species. A world without caste would set everyone free.” (Pg. 388)\n\nThis book will be “must reading” for those concerned with contemporary American society.",
    "Review: Caste– The Origins of Our Discontents, by Isabel Wilkerson, 2020, 475 pp., Random House, original published at Urbanitus.com\n\nAs the razor-edged finale to a presidential election riven by ambiguity reaches its conclusion, one overarching reality will endure in stark clarity: the bi-polar, cultural disease dividing America into two angry and unforgiving camps.\n\nRivers of words diagnosing the malady are fast becoming analytical torrents. Recrimination and reaction to its implications are beginning and will accelerate. As with the companion pandemic that has overlaid this red and blue-hued socio-political plague, experts and historians will parse the origins for generations to come.\n\nThe rest of us, meanwhile, can do something more immediate. We can read Caste – The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson, a book published just in August that reorders most of the prisms through which conservatives and liberals alike think about America in its 244th year. Even if not intended as such, this work of anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, philosophy and history is a deep well of insight, a primer even, into the dynamics that animated the just-concluded vote, and that will surely animate its aftermath.\n\nImplicitly, this book is also about cities, the spaces where the global issues of this moment are being most profoundly tested, from climate change to shelter to migration to policing. It is also in cities, from Austin to Amsterdam to Abuja, where we might hope that the twisting kaleidoscope of a fast-urbanizing world will transform the divisions of caste into a mosaic of equality.\n\nOn one level, Caste is about race and racism, an exploration of America’s original sin of slavery that haunts us today in virtually all of our institutions. But race and racism both have a predecessor that we need to better understand if we are to effectively confront the stubborn and subtle resonance of racism below the surface of so much of what passes for progressive rhetoric.\n\nHow can Austin, for example, be both the most avowedly liberal city in Texas and the most sharply segregated? A large measure of the answer might be found in that predecessor of race and racism, this phenomenon of caste and casteism.\n\nIn fact, the absurd concepts of race and racism are effectively creations of caste, argues Wilkerson. With this insight in hand, she builds on other recent work, going deeply and broadly into a larger realm that connects our history to that of the anti-Semitism in the 1930s that led to the Nazi Holocaust, and to the millennia old caste system of India that brutally stratifies that country today. In the process, Caste expands upon the seminal work of other recent efforts such as last year’s Pulitzer-winning 1619 Project of the New York Times Magazine, and the new book revealing the sanitization of the 1950s and 60s civil rights movement, The Sword and the Shield – The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. by historian Peniel Joseph.\n\nBut Wilkerson also takes her readers backwards to pioneering scholarship in the early 20th Century South by the the Black anthropologist Allison Davis in the 1930s and on to America in the 1940s with the work of Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economic sociologist and Nobel laureate who penned the 1944 classic book An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy. Weaving this tapestry of history and globe-spanning research together, Wilkerson delivers her own pioneering illustration of how tribal hatreds weaken and impoverish victim and victimizer alike — along with all bystanders.\n\n‘None of us are ourselves’\n\n“It was in the making of the New World that Europeans became white, Africans black, and everyone else yellow, red, or brown. It was in the making of the New World that humans were set apart on the basis of what they looked like, identified solely in contrast to one another, and ranked to form a caste system based on a new concept called race. It was in the process of ranking that we were all cast into assigned roles to meet the needs of the larger production,” Wilkerson writes. “None of us are ourselves.”\n\nIt’s not that Wilkerson neglects the horrors of slavery, or for that matter Nazi evil or Brahmin brutality and domination. From castration of slaves to President Andrew Jackson’s horseback riding with bridal reins made from Native American flesh, to lynchings continuing well into the 20th Century, there is little horror that escapes Wilkerson’s gaze. But it is the subtler and more pernicious diffusion of caste into our relationships, our rules of engagement with one another – and ultimately our national politics – that make Caste indispensable to understanding our own cultural wars and the deepening collateral damage.\n\n“Americans of today have inherited these distorted rules of engagement whether or not their families had enslaved people or even been in the United States,” Wilkerson writes. “Slavery built the man-made chasm between blacks and whites that forces the middle castes of Asians, Latinos, indigenous people, and new immigrants of African descent to navigate within what began as a bipolar hierarchy.”\n\nWilkerson takes a vivid example from the March 2018 series of bombings in Austin, Texas that killed two people and injured six over 20 days. The first to die was 39-year-old Anthony House, a project manager living in East Austin, killed after he picked up a package that exploded on his porch. Because House was Black, police initially suspected the case might be drug-related or that House might even have accidentally detonated the bomb himself.\n\n“Based on what we know right now, we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence and in no way this is linked to a terroristic attack,” then-Interim (now permanent) Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters.\n\nSome ten days later, that theory gave way to presumption of a hate crime when another Black and a Latina resident of East Austin, 17-year-old Draylen Mason and 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, died as they picked up similarly disguised bombs left on their porches. But it was only after two White men in West Austin triggered a bomb by tripwire and were critically injured six days later, and two days after that when a bomb exploded at a FedEx warehouse, that the investigation began to suspect domestic terrorism. That brought in the help of 500 federal agents and the “police now raced at warp speed,” Wilkerson notes. Ultimately police cornered the 23-year-old suspect, Mark Conditt, who blew himself up as they closed in.\n\nManley did finally label Conditt a terrorist, but Wilkerson asks, what might have been the outcome if the caste-blinded police had warned the public initially about the threat of randomly dropped packages instead of waiting 10 days?\n\n“People can come to disregard the predicaments facing people deemed beneath them, seeing their misfortunes as having no bearing on their own lives, seeing whatever is happening to them as, say, a black problem, rather than a human problem, unwittingly endangering everyone.”\n\n‘The dominant caste around which all other castes revolve’\n\nIt is this all but hidden taxonomy of rank and status guiding our actions, in ways most of us are scarcely aware of, that is the great choreographer of decision-making in American and other societies, Wilkerson argues of her research that took her to Berlin to understand the rankings of “Aryan purity” in the 1930s and throughout India to examine the workings of India’s intricately complex caste system today.\n\n“A caste system centers the dominant cast as the sun around which all other castes revolve and defines it as the default-setting standard of normalcy, of intellect, of beauty, against which all others are measured, ranked in descending order by the physiological proximity to the dominant caste,” she writes.\n\nThis understanding of caste explains why recent immigrants from Africa have reversed the practice of earlier “middle castes,” say Italians or Jews from Eastern Europe, who quickly changed their surnames to assimilate as quickly as possible into the dominate Anglo-Saxon caste; Binghenheimer becoming Bingham or Rossellini becoming Ross.\n\nImmigrants from Ghana or Grenada cannot so easily join the presumed dominant caste for the obvious reasons of skin color. So they must take pains to isolate themselves from the bottom-rung of African-Americans, maintaining distinctive accents, dress and names, or in some cases even discouraging their children not “to act like African Americans.”\n\nWilkerson quotes the late and greatly esteemed Indian jurist B.R. Ambedkar, who rose from his Dalit, or “Untouchable,” origins to become the author of India’s constitution and anti-caste campaigner: … “each caste takes its pride and its consolation in the fact that in the scale of castes, it is above some other caste.”\n\nWhich, moving toward today’s political reality in America, explains why so many journalists and analysts were, and remain, blindsided by Donald Trump’s support from working class Whites in 2016 and now. And perhaps it is insight into his surprise support in 2020 from some Black males despite support of White supremacists, or the votes for Trump from Latinos in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley despite the wall, the family separations, and the ugly characterizations of migrants.\n\n“The liberal take was that working class whites have been voting against their interest in supporting right-wing oligarchs, but that theory diminishes the agency and caste-oriented principles of the people,” Wilkerson says. “Many voters, in fact, made an assessment of their circumstances and looked beyond immediate short-term benefits and toward, from their perspective, the larger goals of maintaining dominant caste status and their survival long term.”\n\nAnd while caste may take its largest toll on African Americans, through unending police brutality, biased outcomes in court, and the world’s highest incarceration rates, its insidiousness leaves few untouched. It is in fact the dictates of caste that lock all Americans into the worst health care and basic education systems of any developed nation and a growing chasm of income inequality that rewards 1 percent of Americans with more than all the assets of the entire bottom half.\n\nIn short, our caste consciousness has led us to a point where for some a place high in the American caste system has more value than health insurance, a living wage, political instability, protection from a virus, or threats from overseas.\n\n‘The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader’\n\nAnd in a kind of analytical crescendo, Wilkerson brings that dissection of caste right up to what might prove the most durable understanding of the headlines of recent days. For this she turns to the work of Eric Fromm, the late German Jewish psychologist who saw firsthand, and later wrote about, the connection between the pain, anxiety and insecurity of 1920s Weimar Germany and how it fed narcissistic narratives of racial greatness and superiority among the German population that were to nurture and sustain their embrace of a narcissistic leader.\n\n“The right kind of leader can inspire a symbiotic connection that supplants logic,” Wilkerson argues. “The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader, becomes one with the leader, sees his fortunes and his fate as their own.”\n\nShe quotes Fromm himself, who fled the Nazis to the United States and who died in 1980: “The greater the leader, the greater the follower… The narcissism of the leader who is convinced of his greatness, and who has no doubt, is precisely what attracts the narcissism of those who submit to him.”\n\nA single book will hardly resolve the ancient hatreds and divisions of caste and all the destruction they have wrought. A single election, whatever the outcome, will hardly heal the fears and resentments of a dominant caste that have created a society turned against itself. But without the promise of both, as wildfires burn, glaciers melt and cities erupt in violent standoffs, hope for the species seems slight.\n\n“A world without caste,” suggests Wilkerson, “would set everyone free.”",
    "Nobody can dispute that race relations in the US have some distance to go before reaching an acceptable parity. Equally nobody, looking at US history since the civil war, could deny there has been huge progress.\n\nTo repeatedly compare the modern US, to Nazi Germany, is not only historical nonsense it is deeply offensive. If the case is being made that black people in the US are treated like Jewish people in Nazi germany, then it must be possible to imagine a Jewish Reichs Chancellor, Jewish people represented throughout the upper echelons of the legal profession and Jewish intellectuals, such as this lady, making a lucrative career of trotting round the world in the 1930’s criticising the German government. That is obscene.\n\nThis book’s entire premise is built on quicksand and will only exacerbate the growing racial tension being fomented by critical race theory. Real progress on race relations will be made in boring committee rooms where policy decisions are taken and laws tweaked. Those processes are set back hugely by this kind of grotesque exaggeration, which only increases polarisation.\n\nIf you want to understand the philosophy underlying this kind of tripe try Cynical Theory.",
    "I got to know about this book through social media which invoked a curiosity of mine. So I Pre-ordered it. Contrary to the routine, the kindle edition price was also comparable to hardbound editiom. So reluctantly though, I ordered the hardbound one. The binding, paper quality and the font size, all are really worth of the price. About reading experience, I must say this book is at par. Right from the 1st line, this 400-odd pages book gets over you. The writer has written this book simply keeping the american sociology and psychology at prime focus. While doing this, she has compared it with the racism during Nazi Germany and Caste system in India. Though it is a non-fiction, the writer has intermittently narrated some real stories and experiences in such a manner that the reading never gets dull. From Indian perspective, whatever she has mentioned about Indian caste system, they are pure facts and not exaggeration as some of the users have said in their respective reviews here. That's all for now. I am going to write a detailed review on goodreads.",
    "Readers lead by the publisher's notes to expect a scholarly study of the various forms in which caste divisions appear in societies, and their effects, will not find what they are looking for in this book.\nEarly in the introductory chapter it is made clear that \"Us\" in the title means Americans only. In a style irritatingly familiar to others, the author clearly assumes that should be the approach to any form of reportage, without actually stating it. So this book describes only the American caste system, something familiar to educated observers from outside the US of A, but which much of American society has a tradition of denying. There is no mention of the peculiarities of caste in Britain, and the caste conflict of Rwanda and Burundi is mentioned en passant, misrepresented as it usually is as an inter-ethnic conflict.\nThe author makes attempts at comparison of the American caste system, with its obsession with skin colour and ancestry, with the traditions of India, and the doctrines of the short-lived Nazi regime in Germany. She makes multiple claims to having carried out a volume of research into the subject, recounting her multiple eureka moments, yet at the same time describes how previous writers have made the same comparisons generations ago. This was more than a century in the case of comparison with Indian caste conventions, and of course it is well known that the pseudo-science beloved of the Nazi regime has had a widespread following in the USA long before the world heard of Hitler, and long after his fall. This of course is not limited to the USA.\nA verbose, overly decorative and repetitive writing style, with frequent literary digressions, is something of a tradition in American reportage, but to the majority of the anglophone world these things are a pretentious distraction, which frequently disguise superficial content.\nOne wonders what readership this author is writing for. That she is addressing only her fellow Americans is clear enough, but educated Americans, able to look dispassionately at their society, will be familiar with this material - they have seen and heard it before - , and will likely also be offended and alienated by the extravagant and sententious overstatement. Those wedded to their tradition of denial will reject it. It might be of value to some who are less convinced that caste cannot exist in American society and are open to persuasion that it does and needs to be addressed. The book is of no conceivable interest to anyone outside this very specific demographic. Although such a heavily padded tome is unlikely to be an effective tool for this purpose, it is impossible not to wish her some success in this endeavour, and this is the reason for the second star, which comes with more than a suspicion that that may be over-generous.",
    "IW uses a house as an analogy throughout the book to develop her case of the structure of American society. The substructure of the house holds everything up and the layer of the African-American at the bottom and the wealthy and powerful white race layer at the top floor is a caste system. She compares it to the Indian caste system and the Nazi system in Germany, ie. black people and untouchables and Jews respectively all at the bottom. IW says we need to look at society over time to understand it today, just as we look at a family which may have alcoholism in the family. Anecdotes are mixed with data and statistics to clarify matters and confirm how people feel suffering at the bottom of a caste system. The hidden problems in an old house/society sooner or later come out in strange ways which become massive problems as they’ve not been treated until it’s discovered.\nHorrendous examples of racist killings throughout its history are detailed and taken for granted by white people and white made law. The selling postcards of the hanging or burning of black people was so common and natural that the sending of them eventually had to be banned. They got around this by sending them in envelopes. It reminds me today of the black jogger who was killed by a father and son filmed by a friend of theirs. Because of the caste system created each individual is crow-barred into a role which each has to adhere to. Many examples are given of this including the class exercise made of the superior blue eyes and the inferior brown eyes kids in a school. This showed how they all fell into their roles and totally transformed the ways they related to each other. Africans who came to the States identified themselves as their tribe eg. Igbo, Akan etc.; however they were all lumped together as blacks. The same with Europeans who emigrated to the US as Italians or French, they were lumped together as whites. The roles becomes the norm and it looks to be the natural order of things.\nIW goes into detail in India, and Germany of the 30s and 40s and compares their castes and how it functions to the US one. This shows the similarities and the end results being virtually the same. The wealthy, powerful white elite assume their dominant role in US society, as does the African-American subordinate role at the bottom to ensure their attitudes. The hierarchical structure becomes an enormous obstacle for all to move from. The Jim Crow laws ensured that this was maintained and led to crimes against humanity which were viewed as totally normal and natural. The author says that there are 8 Pillars of Caste and goes into all of them in detail which make up the Foundation of Caste. She talks of wolf packs and how hierarchical that is and that when the lowest wolf dies the pack grieves and are totally lost for a period. They have lost their substructure which was the glue which held them all up. With the 60s civil rights acts and a black president this caused a feeling of, “this equality feels like a demotion” to the lowest layer of white people in the structure.”\n“History has shown that nations and groups will conquer, colonize, enslave, and kill to maintain their illusion of primacy”. She then goes on to talk of Erich Fromm and his theory of fascism and the narcissistic self. The white working class may feel, “even though I am poor and uncultured I am somebody important because I belong to the most admirable group in the world….Caste is more than rank, it is a state of mind that holds everyone captive, the dominant imprisoned in an illusion of their own entitlement….the ancient code for the subordinate caste calls upon them to see the world not with their own eyes but as the dominant caste sees it..the message of inferiority comes at you in whispers and billboards, it burrows into your identity”. She gives several examples of people keeping silent when racism is overt and puts forward Don Lemon’s argument that silence is not an option.\nThe premature aging of cells leads to the early onset of disease due to chronic exposure to such stressors as discrimination, job loss or obesity. African-Americans lead such a stressful life under the dominant caste that they suffer greatly which leads to all sorts of ill-health and the explanation of why they suffer more under such things as Covid 19. In 2012 Obama won 39% of white American votes, in Mississippi only 10% voted for him, in other words, he won despite the bulk of the white electorate. Census projections state that the white majority will end in 2042 which is frightening to many white people. Researchers, “the belief that undeserving groups are getting ahead while your group is left behind”. She compares Germany to US and how they treat their appalling histories totally differently. Germany feels guilt and shame whereas Confederate flags and statues are the norm in the southern states.\nShe looks at the data of things, such as infant mortality, and maths and reading, and the richest country comes out poorly. IW brings the book up to date with Covid 19 and the total shambles of the USA. She talks about Einstein who came to US and stood up against racism and wished more white people would. “the bottom caste, though it bears much of the burden of the hierarchy, did not create the system, and the bottom caste alone cannot fix it….caste is a disease and none of us is immune..for most of American history, the country was closed off from the talents of the bulk of its people of all colours, genders, and nationalities…a world without caste would set everyone free”\nToday as I write this (19 Sept. 2020) Trump is trying to change the school curriculum to make it whiter than white. Also Alicia Keys says in an interview, “I am that person, she says, the one that wasn’t supposed to make it out of Hell’s Kitchen, who was supposed to end up being a prostitute, a young mother at 16, or addicted to drugs. I am the one who was supposed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and get injured or killed”.",
    "I am not even sure if this review can do this book justice. It is not an exaggeration to say that Caste is life changing. Isabel Wilkerson somehow manages to crystallise the complex roots and branches of systemic discrimination into a book. It can only be her supreme intelligence that has allowed her to see connections I missed, bring together works across the spectrum of the sciences, to knead together the issue across the continents. Utterly compelling, beautifully written; you will savour it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough; if Amazon allowed for ‘infinity’ stars I would give it that. This should feature on every school curriculum in every country across the world."

    "If you have any interest to go deeper into platonic friendships this book is a phenomenal read on the subject! Ever since I became friends with a woman back in 2002, I have had a passionate interest in reading non-fiction books about platonic friendship. Twenty years later, I still enjoy a close friendship (platonic) with her. I have also read several hundred books on friendship!\n\nThere are a handful number of books out there that stand head and shoulders above the run-of-the-mill friendship books. Franco's book now joins those elite books that take us deep into platonic friendship. In an amusing twist of irony, she makes platonic friendship appear \"sexy.\" That's just a joke. But what I mean by that ironic joke, is that she truly does the unthinkable for a book on platonic friendship. She fleshes out the subject from personal experience, deep research, delightful anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book, and provocative but grounded interpretations to make the platonic friendships highly desirable in 2022.\n\nIn our Western culture it is quite common to view platonic friendship experience as second-rate or quite bland when viewed in light of either romantic or sexual love. From the very first page she provokes the reader to think about the connection between platonic love and the contemporary psychological theory of attachment. For any student of the history of friendships you are going to love when Franco connects dots between friendships going back a hundred years and to present day healthy platonic attachment.\n\nShe does what the title promises. That's why it is a must read for all friendship lovers or those who want to grow in their friendship experience. After introducing the subject, she takes you through the attachment theory and then proceeds to refer back to it in various ways throughout the book. She makes you think reflectively about your attachment styles and how they impact your inner self (and friendship) when faced with various platonic friendship scenarios. But she doesn't get lost in a dense, abstract psychological forest. I have read books by psychological experts who get lost in the theoretical forest. But not Franco.\n\nI give Franco a standing ovation for taking a subject that typically invokes a low-cultural desire (\"platonic\") and making it highly desirable and enjoyable. She stays in the platonic lane and uncovers the beautiful communal boundaries for present day platonic connection. At no point in the book does platonic experience become a poor-boundaried pushover to sexual love or romantic love. As she stays in the platonic lane, she truly makes platonic friendship a great and special gift. This book easily rises to my top five books I have read on platonic friendship in the past twenty years. I got a copy in advance from Net Galley.",
    "If you're lonely or struggling, read this book. Making friends doesn't have to be a chore, and it doesn't have to be elusive.\n\nI'm in my late 30s and I have two young kids, and I know how hard it is to fit anything else into the day, yet reading this book gave me hope and optimism for making more friends. Just as the pandemic was starting, my husband and I moved (it was a move we'd started before the pandemic hit), and we ended up in a new town with zero contacts, work-from-home jobs, and virtual school.\n\nOver the last two years, community has been too hard to come by, and I've felt the sadness that is not knowing enough people around me. After two years of the pandemic chaos, I decided to make a concerted effort to build more friendships and connections in this town. This book is the perfect tool for understanding how friendships start, with clear takeaways for what to do (and how to do it).\n\nThis book is great for nerds (like me) as well as casual readers who want to figure out how to make new friends. Marisa G Franco is a PhD psychologist who studies friendships, relationships, and attachment, and she's sifted through hundreds of studies on how friendships are made and distilled it into stories and ideas that can be immediately implemented. I was given an early review copy to read in advance of publication, and here's what I learned:\n\n** Most people (wrongly) assume that other people don't like them. The good news? Most people actually like you more than you think! That means the voice in your head saying people don't like you ISN'T TRUE. Thank goodness.\n\n** Most people are waiting for someone else to initiate something. That means we're ALL waiting for someone else to make the first move! The good news is that if you initiate, you have a really good chance of making new friends. Initiation can look like making an observation and asking a question, like \"I really like this music, what do you think?\" or \"What a gorgeous dress, are you a designer?\"\n\n** Initiation can be relatively small, like \"I noticed XYZ, what did you think?\" She shares this \"insight-question\" from another researcher and I immediately used it at the coffee shop the next day. I also started using the initiation strategy to text other parents from my kids' classrooms and say hello. \"Hey, I'm so-and-so's mom, I'm so glad we're in class together, let me know if you ever need to coordinate!\"\n\nWe live in a world where it's harder and harder to make friends. Countless headlines reveal that most adults have only a few friends, if that. Many men have only one close friend, and many more would say they have zero adult friends. When we don't have friends and community, our physical/emotional wellness suffers.\n\nIf you read this book and commit to taking just one of the actions in it each week, chances are you'll know dozens of people by name by this time next year. For me, I'm specifically missing community—people who know my name, and whose name I know—and this book has inspired me to reach out and strike up new conversations with people. Even if they're not my best friends (yet), I'm so much better off for it.",
    "This thoughtfully written, engaging book by Dr. Franco comes to us as a gift and a guide in world that urgently needs to be reminded of the power of friends and social connection in general. Franco's impetus for the book was the realization that she, like so many of us, have overvalued romantic love and undervalued the gentle but powerful love of friends... \"why settle for the one, when you can have the many\"\nThrough case studies, personal observations, reams of social research and examples across history (my favorite being a story about Lincoln), Franco demonstrates time and time again how vitally important our social network (and i don't mean FB or Insta) is to our mental, emotional and even physical health.\nAnd what's most helpful is the prism through which she helps us understand why we sometimes have trouble making or keeping friends - attachment theory. The more securely attached, the more trusting we find the world, and the easier to make, forgive, makeup with, and keep friends.\nAnd for those of us dealing with anxious or avoidant attachment issues, Franco has tips and tricks to help us out - so that we can lead more fulfilling and nurtured lives. Through the friends who are our mirrors, our mentors, our shoulders to cry on, our cheerleaders, and our confidantes, our lives have meaning and purpose - all said in a flowing, erudite and at times funny prose (OPP - other people's puppies).\nA timely and vital book, well worth reading and reading again. Kudos to Dr. Franco!"

    "This vast opus is the generally acknowledged bible for discontented Americans.\n\nIf you’re looking for the source of the expression “the one percent” it’s right here. In the final, 2003, edition I’m holding in my hands (the original was published in 1980), the call to arms comes on page 632:\n\n“One percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth. The rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99 percent against one another. I am taking the liberty of uniting those 99 percent as \"the people\"”\n\nThe author’s stated aim here is to write an alternative history of the US, filling in the bits the official history books leave out: the struggles of the 99%, those he calls “the people.”\n\nI’ve owned the “People’s History” for some time. I finally picked it up when it became clear Hillary would be running for President. There’s a chapter here on the Clinton years that I thought I had to read. But I needed the context (for example, what did Zinn think of the Carter years?) so I forced myself to plod through the whole thing before getting to the events of 1992-2000. I read it, dunno, in one week.\n\nA history of the people, anyway one cares to define a people, it most certainly ain’t.\n\nThere is a history hiding in this book, but it is the history of American Socialism and civil disobedience followed by a diatribe against American Imperialism (not once named by its name in the entire book!!!), tightly fused with a compendium (but NOT a history) of the most salient dates and figures plucked from the histories of (i) the autochthonous American Indians (ii) the negro slaves and the civil rights movement (iii) the women’s movement and (iv) the labor movement, provided they tie in to the history of socialism in America. The history of the oppressed is very much a supporting act.\n\nSo I sat down and I read it again, to make sure this was not just a first impression. Second time I read it slower and took notes. The notes I took probably reflect my prejudices, but also strongly strengthened my views about the “People’s History.”\n\nBottom line is Howard Zinn worships revolutionaries and dissidents, but has very little time for the people who arrive at the compromises that move us forward. If he were alive today and had to write a book about the Arab Spring, he’d be all over the Tunisian greengrocer who set himself alight and the students who occupied Tahrir Square in Cairo, but (much like the coverage in today’s press) would not spend any time on the plight of the current prime minister of Tunisia, Habib Essid (yes, that’s his name, I had to look it up, have never read it in the paper, nobody cares), who’s having to deal with reviving an economy in the middle of ISIS attacks.\n\nSo if your history class never discussed the Wobblies, if you never heard Hellen Keller was a Socialist, if it’s Sacco and Vanzetti you want to know about, if you want to brush up on the injustice inflicted upon Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, if you want a good account of the Attica prison uprising, or the blood letting of the Plowshares Eight, if you forget who Ron Kovic was or if you want to read about the connection between David Koresh and Timothy McVeigh, this is the book for you. But be prepared to also read that it was all in vain and that nothing good came of it. Any and all advances in workers’ rights, working conditions, voice, universal suffrage, prosperity etc., all advances in civil rights, environmental protection, freedom of speech are invariably brushed off as the crumbs off the high table that were thrown the workers’ way to prevent Revolution.\n\nIf you agree with Malcolm X that President Kennedy hijacked the March on Washington, that it was “a sellout, a takeover” you will not hear otherwise in this book, that’s for sure. If you think that the spectacular advantage the USA gained versus other developed nations in the 19th century by making education mandatory was entirely aimed at aiding the industrial system and that “Loyalty oaths, teacher certification, and the requirement of citizenship were introduced to control both the educational and the political quality of the teachers” you’ll find that as a quote on page 263.\n\nAnd another thing: the book is packed with inaccuracies. Some are nothing more that poor fact-checking. On page 657, for example, the Chinese student massacres are dated as a 1991 event. Tiananmen happened in 1989, of course.\n\nSome inaccuracies are more annoying than that, they reflect laziness, a reluctance to check the facts in the interest of telling a good story. For example, on page 426 Zinn discusses the aftermath of the communist attempt to take over my home country of Greece and its defeat by the allies as follows:\n\n\"The rebellion was defeated by 1949. US economic and military aid continued to the Greek government. Investment capital from Esso, Dow Chemical, Chrysler and other US corporations flowed into Greece. But illiteracy, poverty, and starvation remained widespread there, with the country in the hands of what Richard Barnet called a \"particularly brutal and backward military dictatorship\"\"\n\nThis is plain wrong. Greece had a series of democratically-elected governments between 1949 and 1967. We did have a military dictatorship, but that was much later, from 1967 to 1974 and it was indeed very backward, but not particularly brutal. This is something Zinn could very easily have checked, but he didn’t bother to. How am I supposed to trust him on the stuff I don’t know about when the only historical reference I can pass judgment on does not check?\n\nFinally, there is deliberate inaccuracy here. My favorite example is on page 98 where he quotes Beard in saying the Constitution substituted \"life, liberty and property\" for the original \"life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" from the Declaration of Independence, but I just read both texts and he's deliberately letting this INTERPRETATION of the constitution pass of as an actual QUOTE, which it isn't. Tut tut tut.\n\nBy the time I got to the Clinton years, I had to concede that given there isn’t a good word here for FDR or for Carter, any criticism of Clinton would have to be taken with a pinch of salt. His main complaints on my favorite Arkansan (not) are as follows:\n\np. 646 Clinton's attack on Waco is deemed to have been \"a reckless decision to launch a military attack on a group of men, women and children\" \"As so often happens in cases where the government commits murder, the surviving victims are put on trial\" Renos Avraam (convicted): \"This nation is supposed to run under laws, no personal feelings. When you ignore the law you sow the seeds of terrorism.\"\n\np. 646 \"This turned out to be a prophetic statement. Timothy Mc Veigh, who some years after the Waco tragedy was convicted of bombing the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which cost 168 livs, had visited the Waco site twice.\"\n\np. 646 \"Clinton's \"law and order\" approach led him early in his first term to sign legislation cutting funds for the state resource centers that supplied lawyers to indigent prisoners.\"\n\np. 647 \"The \"Crime Bill\" of 1996,…,dealt with the problem of crime by emphasizing punishment, not prevention. It extended the death penalty to a whole range of criminal offenses, and provided $8 billion for the building of new prisons.\"\n\np. 648 \"Both major political parties joined to pass legislation, which Clinton then signed, to remove welfare benefits (food stamps, payments to elderly and disabled people) from no only illegal but legal immigrants. By early 1997, letters were going out to close to a million legal immigrants who were poor, old, or disabled, warning them that their food stamps and cash payments would be cut off in a few months unless they became citizens.\"\n\np. 649 \"In early 199, Congress and the President joined to pass an 'Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,' allowing deportation of any immigrant ever convicted of a crime, no matter how long ago or how serious. Lawful permanent residents who had married Americans and now had children were not exempt.\"\n\np. 649 \"The aim of welfare reform was to force poor families receiving federal cash benefits (many of them single mothers with children) to go to work by cutting off their benefits after two years, limiting lifetime benefits to five years, and allowing people without children to get food stamps for only three months in any three-year period.\"\n\nSo nothing we did not know, really. Not worth reading a 700 page book for.\n\nThat said, there is a story that’s told well here, and it’s the story of American Socialism. To prove I did read this book, I leave my summary as an appendix.\n\nBut if you’ve not read this book, don’t feel compelled to do so. Read something else!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix 1: The History of Socialism in America, as told by Howard Zinn\n\nThe story of American Socialism as told in this book goes as follows: the United States of America was set up to serve the interests of the “landed white aristocrats, who coopted the white artisans and laborers” (p. 65) to fight their war against taxation by the British. However, “no new social class came to power through the door of the American Revolution. The men who engineered the revolt were largely members of the colonial ruling class\" (p. 85) and “rebellion against British rule allowed a certain group of the colonial elite to replace those loyal to England, give some benefits to small landowners, and leave poor white working people and tenant farmers in very much the same situation\" (p. 86)\n\nZinn next takes aim at the Constitution, which he dismisses as “a compromise between slaveholding interests in the South and moneyed interests of the North” (p. 98) reflecting the fact that “most of the makers of the Constitution had some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal government: the manufacturers needed protective tariffs; the moneylenders wanted to stop the use of paper money to pay off debts; the land speculators wanted protection as they invaded Indian lands; slaveowners needed federal security against slave revolts and runaways; bondholders wanted a government able to raise money by nationwide taxation to pay off those bonds” (p. 89), also noting that “forty of the fifty five men who drafted the constitution held government bonds” (p. 89)\n\nIn summary, the Founding Fathers “did not want a balance, except one which kept things as they were, a balance among the dominant forces at that time. They certainly did not want an equal balance between slaves and masters, propertyless and property holders, Indians and white” (p. 101)\n\nThe way Zinn sees it, the “people\" next got diverted into fighting the Indians: “with the eastern elite controlling the lands on the seaboard, the poor, seeking land, were forced to go West, thereby becoming a useful bulwark for the rich because \"the first target of the Indian's hatchet was the frontierman's skull\" (p.88) A full chapter is dedicated to the systematic elimination of the Indians, especially under President Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe Civil War comes under the microscope next. It’s not at all the standard version. The main claim is that Abraham Lincoln may or may not have had his personal preferences when it came to the abolition of slavery, but that, in the words of the London Spectator: the Emancipation Proclamation had \"all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading: The principle is not that a human being cannot justly own another, but that he cannot own him unless he is loyal to the United States.\" (p. 192) Zinn basically alleges that Lincoln was mainly looking after the interests of the North and not much more. Extensive coverage is also given to the large number of deserters, which is where the “civil disobedience” theme of the book kicks off.\n\nThe story moves on to the plight of the small farmer in the late 19th century. Either he was indentured to an estate (and the story of several movements and uprisings is given, with emphasis on the Rensselaer Estate) or he found himself sliding from small landowner to renter as the price of agricultural products fell, while his costs rose. The Homestead Act of 1860 distributed land to independent farmers, but, in the author’s words, \"the government played its part in helping the bankers and hurting the farmers; it kept the amount of money -based on the gold supply- steady, while the population rose, so there was less and less money in circulation. The farmer had to pay off his debts in dollars that were harder to get. The bankers, getting the loans back, were getting dollars worth more than when they loaned them out - a kind of interest on top of interest. That is why so much of the talk of farmers' movements in those days had to do with putting more money in circulation -by printing greenbacks or by making silver a basis for issuing money.” (p. 284)\n\nThis segues naturally into the tale of the Progressive movement: its humble beginnings in 1877 Depression Texas with the Farmers’ Alliance, the Cleburne Demands and the formation of the Populist Party, its 1890 convention in Topeka, Kansas and the ultimate miscalculation the Progressives made when they entered mainstream politics in coalition with the Democratic Party in the 1896 elections, who coopted them by promising to introduce Silver into the specie, reducing the entire thrust of the Progressive movement to a single issue.\n\n\"Once allied with the Democratic party in supporting William Jennings Bryan for President in 1896, Populism would drown in a sea of Democratic politics. If the Democrats won, it would be absorbed. If the Democrats lost, it would disintegrate. Electoral politics brought into the top leadership the political brokers instead of the agrarian radicals.\" (p. 294) And so it was that this movement came to a dead end when Bryan, the Democratic candidate, was defeated by William McKinley.\n\nThis is a brief interlude and from there we get to the robber barons of the late nineteenth century, the railroad and steel magnates, the Carnegies, the Morgans etc. Here’s where they fit into the narrative:\n\n\"Land cost money and machines cost money -so farmers had to borrow, hoping that the prices of their harvests would stay high, so they could pay back for the loan, the railroad for the transportation, the grain merchant for the handling of the grain, the storage elevator for storing it. But they found the prices for their produce going down, and the prices of transportation and loans going up, because the individual farmer could not control the price of his grain, while the monopolist railroad and the monopolist banker could charge what they liked. (p. 283)\n\nThe robber barons are not Zinn’s favorites: \"By 1904 more than a thousand railroad lines had been consolidated into six great combinations, each allied with either Morgan or Rockefeller interests\" (p. 323)\n\"The imperial leader of the new oligarchy was the House of Morgan. In its operations it was ably assisted by the First National Bank of New York, (directed by George F. Baker) and the National City Bank of New York (presided by James Stillman, agent of the Rockefeller interests). Among them, these three men and their financial associates occupied 341 directorships in 112 great corporations. The total resources of these corporations in 1912 was 22,245,000,000, more than the assessed value of all property in the twenty-two states and territories west of the Mississippi River.” (p. 323)\n\nEven their philanthropy is portrayed as a cynical attempt to support a system:\n\n“Rockefeller helped found the University of Chicago. Huntington, of the Central Pacific, gave money to two Negro colleges, Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute. Carnegie gave money to colleges and Libraries. Johns Hopkins was founded by a millionaire merchant, and millionaires Cornelius Vanderbilt, Ezra Cornell, James Duke and Leland Stanford created universities in their names” (p. 262) “These universities did not encourage dissent; they trained the middlemen in the American system - the teachers, doctors, lawyers, administrators, engineers, technicians, politicians - those who would be paid to keep the system going, to be loyal buffers against trouble.” (p. 263)\n\nHe does not think much of the sundry attempts to contain the robber barons and their trusts. He cannot get himself to say anything nice about the Sherman Act, even:\n\n\"The Sherman Anti-Trust Act, passed in 1890, called itself \"An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints\" and made it illegal to form a \"combination or conspiracy\" to restrain trade in interstate of foreign commerce. Senator John Sherman, author of the Act, explained the need to conciliate the critics of monopoly: \"They had monopolies of old, but never before such giants as in our day. You must heed their appeal or be ready for the socialist, the communist, the nihilist. Society is now disturbed by forces like never before\" (p. 259)\n\nHe regardless complains that: \"In 1895 the Court interpreted the Sherman Act as to make it harmless. It said a monopoly of sugar refining was a monopoly in manufacturing, not commerce, and so could not be regulated by Congress through the Sherman Act,” (p. 260) which to my ears does not sound consistent. Either it was no big deal, or its reinterpretation was no big deal, but one can’t advocate both…\n\nHe also views the Supreme Court as an instrument of suppression:\n\n\"State Legislatures, under the pressure of aroused farmers, has passed laws to regulate the rates charges farmers by the railroads. The Supreme Court (Wabash v. Illinois, 1886) said states could not do this, that this was an intrusion on federal power\" and, separately, \"the Supreme Court accepted the argument that corporations were \"persons\" and their money was property protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supposedly the Fourteenth Amendment had been passed to protect Negro rights, but of the Fourteenth Amendment cases brought before the Supreme Court between 1890 and 1910, nineteen dealt with the Negro, 288 dealt with corporations.” (both p. 261)\n\nHaving gotten these preliminaries out of the way, he dives into the birth of American Socialism, which was born in the great labor uprisings of 1877 – 1894. This is, very much, the heart of the book, the book Zinn really cared to write, and it shows: it’s rather good.\n\nThe scene is set as follows: \"There were 5.5 million immigrants in the 1880s, 4 million in the 1890s, creating a labor surplus that kept wages down. The immigrants were more controllable, more helpless than native workers, they were cultutrally displaced, at odds with one another, therefore useful as strike-breakers. Often their children worked, intensifying the problem of an oversized labor force and joblessness; in 1880 there were 1,118,000 children under sixteen (one out of six) at work in the United States\" (p. 266). Also, we’re informed that \"The new immigrants became laborers, housepainters, stonecutters, ditchdiggers. They were often imported en masse by contractors\" (p. 266)\n\nWe then get a blow-by-blow account of the execution of the nineteen “Molly Maguires” in coal-mining Pennsylvania in 1874, the Great Railroad Strike of 1874 in Martinsburg, West Virginia and how it spread to Baltimore, St. Louis and Pittsburgh and taken through the full story of the great railroad strikes of 1877, as a result of which “a hundred people were dead, a thousand had gone to jail, 100,000 workers had gone on strike and the strikes had roused into action countless unemployed in the cities\" (p. 251), on the way to a full account of the most celebrated workers’ uprising in history, the events that took place in Chicago in the spring of 1886.\n\nI don’t know why, but Zinn studiously avoids making the link to the internationally celebrated Mayday holiday which refers to the Haymarket Square events. Here’s the only quote where you get any hint:\n\"By the spring of 1886, the movement for an eight-hour day had grown. On May 1, the American Federation of Labor, now five years old, called for nationwide strikes wherever the eight-hour day as refused. Terrence Powderly, head of the Knights of Labor, opposed the strike, saying that employers and employees must first be educated on the eight-hour day, but assemblies of the Knights made plans to strike.” (p. 269)\n\nBut he does describe the events rather fully, referring to the May 4 Haymarket Square bomb that left 66 policemen wounded, 7 fatally, and the blame that was laid at the feet of Parsons and Spies, the leaders of the Central Labor Union, the eight death sentences that followed, and of course the fact that when four years later four of the Haymarket eight were executed, people all over the US arose: \"it is impossible to know the number of individuals whose political awakening came after the Haymarket Affair\" (p. 271) Moreover, “with over 1,400 strikes involving more than 500,000 people, year 1886 became known as the year of the great uprising of labor; this came after an average of 500 strikes a year involving 150,000 people from 1881 to 1885” (p. 273)\n\nStrong accounts follow of the 1891 Tennessee Coal Mine Company strike in 1891 and of course the 1892 Carnegie Steel Plant strike at Homestead Pennsylvania, where Henry Clay Frick (who later survived being shot by anarchist Alexander Berkman in his office) hired the Pinkerton detective agency to fight the strikers and protect the strike breakers, leading not only to many deaths, but crucially also to the acquittal of the strikers, possibly the first instance in the history of the US labor movement where the workers won over the sympathy of the jury.\n\nAnd so the scene is now set for the establishment of the Socialist Party:\n\n“The year 1893 saw the biggest economic crisis in the country's history: 642 banks failed and 16,000 businesses closed down. Out of a labor force of 15 million, 3 million were unemployed” (p. 277)\nIt was the Depression of 1893 that propelled Eugene Debs into a lifetime of action for unionism and socialism. He formed the American Railway Union despite having opposed the great strikes of 1877 (p. 278)\n\nThe 1894 Pullman Palace Car Company strike, which was crushed on orders of President Grover Cleveland (13 dead, 55 wounded and 700 arrested) resulted in the arrest of Eugene Debs. \"Debs, in court, denied he was a socialist. But during his six months in prison he studied socialism and talked to fellow prisoners who were socialist.. Later he wrote \"I was to be baptized in Socialism in the roar of conflict.\"\" (p. 281)\n\n“The Socialist party was founded in 1901 and made Eugene Debs its presidential candidate 5 times; its newspaper, \"Appeal to Reason\" had half a million subscribers (p. 393), as \"Socialism moved out of the small circles of city immigrants -Jewish and German socialists speaking their own languages - and became American. The strongest Socialist state was Oklahoma, which in 1914 has twelve thousand dues-paying members (more than New York State\" (p. 340)\n\nFrom that point it’s been steadily downhill for American Socialism, and it’s downhill for the “People’s History” too, I’m afraid.\n\nAs discussed above, a big problem is that Zinn only seems capable of celebrating revolutionaries, rather than all true leaders. So we are treated to a the full story of the (admittedly rather remarkable and often very effective) anarcho-syndicalist “wobblies” of the IWW who advocated \"direct action by, for and of the workers themselves, without the treacherous aid of labor misleaders or scheming politicians\" and aimed to bring about \"the general strike which will complete the expropriation of the employers\" (p. 330).\n\nOn the other hand, there’s contempt for the more mainstream unions that actually negotiated and brought about serious and lasting reforms. The achievements of the “Progressive Period” leave Zinn cold, basically. He recounts how:\n• Teddy Roosevelt brought the Meat Inspection Act, the Hepburn Act (on railroads and pipelines), the Pure Food and Drug Act;\n• Taft created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate telephone and telegraph, proposed the 16th Amendment (graduated Income Tax) and the 17th Amendment (direct election of Senators);\n• Woodrow Wilson created the Federal Trade Commission to control the growth of monopolies and the Federal Reserve Bank\nbut he’s rather churlish about it all, complaining that Roosevelt’s action against the trusts, for example was “to induce them to accept government regulation in order to prevent destruction.” (p. 351). The accusation here is that \"The new approach was concerned with the long-range stability of the system, even at the cost, sometimes, of short-term profits” (p. 351) and the fact that by 1920 forty-two states had workmen’s compensation laws is presented as a negative, perhaps because \"It seems quite clear that much of this intense activity for Progressive reform was intended to head off socialism.\" (p. 353)\n\nMy reaction is “who cares?” The US has plenty to be proud of in its past, and if the people who made these changes were looking to find a balance between the labor movement and business who is Howard Zinn to complain? The fact that “old age pensions and insurance against sickness, accident and unemployment are cheaper, are better business than jails, poor houses, asylums, hospitals\" (p. 354) does not bother me, personally, at all. They are better, period.\nThe gilded age of the twenties is comes next and is granted the appropriate contempt, followed by the story of the Great Depression, which of course did some serious damage to the Socialist Party. Zinn tells the story of the bonus army parade on Washington of 1932 that saw Douglas McArthur, Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton in charge of four troops of cavalry, four companies of infantry, a machine gun squadron and six tanks, all there to disperse the 20,000 WWI veterans who asked for but were refused some help. (p. 391)\n\nNext, Zinn finds plenty to celebrate in the emergence of the major advance of the labor movement in the thirties, the sit-down strike (p. 399), but does not have it in him to show the same exuberance about the fact that child labor was officially abolished in 1938 or the fact that both minimum wage and the forty hour week were also established at that time. (p. 403)\n\nWith the labor movement having fully achieved all its goals, Zinn then turns his attention fully to decrying American Imperialism (which he never calls by its name) and the military-industrial complex (which he also never calls by his name)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix 2: The History of American Imperialism, as told by Howard Zinn (can’t bother to finish it, sorry)\n\nThis thread of the book starts with his account of President Polk’s Mexican war, which the US apparently provoked (no reason to doubt him), continues with President McKinley’s Spanish-American War (an American invasion of Cuba in all but name) and goes on to the annexation of the Philippines (the Philippine-American War)\n\nThe main idea here is that not only were these wars were fought in the interest of business, they also reflected American racism:\n\n\"would not a foreign adventure deflect some for the rebellious energy that went into strikes and protest movements toward an external enemy? Would it not unite people with government, with the armed forces, instead of against them? This was probably not a conscious plan among most of the elite - but a natural development from the twin drives of capitalism and nationalism\" (p. 297)\n\n\"by 1891, the Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company accounted for 90 percent of American exports of kerosene and controlled 70 percent of the world market.\" (p. 301)\n\n\"an appeal for foreign markets would be especially strong if the expansion looked like an act of generosity -helping a rebellious group overthrow foreign rule -as in Cuba\" (p. 301)\n\nWinston Churchill is quoted as having written about the Cuban revolutionary war: \"A grave danger represents itself. Two-fifths of the insurgents in the field are negroes. These men would, in the event of success, demand a predominant share in the government of the country, the result being, after years of fighting, another black republic.\" (p. 303)\n\nPresident McKinley is also quoted saying \"There is nothing left for us to do but to take them all and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow men for whom Christ also died\"",
    "Apart from his unique view of American history and of his treatment of many of the landmark events of that history, Howard Zinn gives us any number of interesting and noteworthy observations in the course of this 700-page text. I beg your indulgence while we look at just a few….\n\nOn p. 73, “(t)o say that the Declaration of Independence, even by its own language, was limited to life, liberty and happiness for white males is not to denounce the makers and signers of the Declaration for holding the ideas expected of privileged males of the eighteenth century. Reformers and radicals, looking discontentedly at history, are often accused of expecting too much from a past political epoch – and sometimes they do. But the point of noting those outside the arc of human rights in the Declaration is not, centuries late and pointlessly, to lay impossible moral burdens on that time. It is to try to understand the way in which the Declaration functioned to mobilize certain groups of Americans, ignoring others. Surely, inspirational language to create a secure consensus is still used, in our time, to cover up serious conflicts of interest in that consensus, and to cover up, also, the omission of large parts of the human race.”\n\nAnd then, on p. 96: “(t)he problem of democracy in the post-Revolutionary society was not, however, the Constitutional limitations on voting. It lay deeper, beyond the Constitution, in the division of society into rich and poor. For if some people had great wealth and great influence; if they had the land, the money, the newspapers, the church, the educational system – how could voting, however broad, cut into such power? There was still another problem: wasn’t it the nature of representative government, even when most broadly based, to be conservative, to prevent tumultuous change?”\n\nFor the answer to that last question, we can, of course, always turn to the pleasantly incendiary words of no less than Thomas Jefferson, which Mr. Zinn naturally and deftly does: “‘I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing…. It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government…. God forbid that we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion…. The Tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.’”\n\nOne can only imagine how Jefferson would’ve reacted to the following open letter penned by Ralph Waldo Emerson to President Van Buren in 1838 as the still young nation hung its head in shame for the Trail of Tears it had just blazed: “(t)he soul of man, the justice, the mercy that is the heart’s heart in all men, from Maine to Georgia, does abhor this business…a crime is projected that confounds our understanding by its magnitude, a crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees of a country for how could we call the conspiracy that should crush these poor Indians our government, or the land that was cursed by their parting and dying imprecations our country any more? You, sir, will bring down that renowned chair in which you sit into infamy if your seal is set to this instrument of perfidy; and the name of this nation, hitherto the sweet omen of religion and liberty, will stink to the world” (p. 147).\n\nWas the very noble Van Buren at all distressed by the death of thousands of Cherokee Indians along this Trail of Tears when, at the end of the same year, he spoke to Congress? “It affords sincere pleasure to apprise the Congress of the entire removal of the Cherokee Nation of Indians to their new homes west of the Mississippi. The measures authorized by Congress at its last session have had the happiest effects” (p. 148). (Emphasis is mine.)\n\nAnd if you think that all of the wars the U. S. participated in right up to Vietnam were “good” wars (as I did until now), consider what we have in the way of a diary entry from a certain Colonel Hitchcock: “I have said from the first that the United States are the aggressors…. We have not one particle of right to be here…. It looks as if the government sent a small force on purpose to bring on a war, so as to have a pretext for taking California and as much of this country as it chooses, for, whatever becomes of this army, there is no doubt of a war between the United States and Mexico…. My heart is not in this business … but, as a military man, I am bound to execute orders” (p. 151).\n\nAs I’ve already said, Zinn has a singular way of characterizing some of history’s more significant events. As yet another example, I give you the following from p. 171 (on the first page of Chapter 9, titled “Slavery without Submission, Emancipation without Freedom”: “…it was Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves, not John Brown. In 1859, John Brown was hanged, with federal complicity, for attempting to do by small-scale violence what Lincoln would do by large-scale violence several years later – end slavery.”\n\nAnd lest there still be any doubt about Abraham Lincoln’s position on American blacks and the issue of slavery, Zinn gives us these two very telltale quotes:\n\n“I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people….\nAnd inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race” (p. 188).\n\nMoreover, and in direct response to the Editor of the New York Tribune, Horace Greeley, we find this (on p. 191): “Dear Sir: … I have not meant to leave any one in doubt…. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy Slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about Slavery and the colored race, I do because it helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union…. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men, everywhere, could be free. Yours, A. Lincoln.”\n\nBut history (and human “progress”) moves on – and so, we have this: “(i)n 1877, (the year, according to David Burbank, in his book REIGN OF THE RABBLE, ‘no American city has come so close to being ruled by a workers’ soviet, as we would now call it, as St. Louis, Missouri’ – p. 250), the same year blacks learned they did not have enough strength to make real the promise of equality in the Civil War, working people learned they were not united enough, not powerful enough, to defeat the combination of private capital and government power” (p. 251).\n\nAnd Zinn then opens Chapter 11 (“Robber Barons and Rebels”) with this: “(i)n the year 1877, the signals were given for the rest of the century: the black would be put back; the strikes of white workers would not be tolerated; the industrial and political elites of North and South would take hold of the country and organize the greatest march of economic growth in human history. They would do it with the aid of, and at the expense of, black labor, white labor, Chinese labor, European immigrant labor, female labor, rewarding them differently by race, sex, national origin, and social class, in such a way as to create separate levels of oppression – a skillful terracing to stabilize the pyramid of wealth” (p. 253).\n\nFor those who think the “Occupy Wall Street” movement of the new millennium was a singular invention of the millennial generation, you might want to consider what Mary Ellen Lease, of the newly formed People’s Party, had to tell those assembled at that party’s first convention in 1890 in Topeka, KS: “Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street and for Wall Street…. Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags…. The politicians said we suffered from overproduction. Overproduction, when 10,000 little children … starve to death every year in the U. S. and over 100,000 shop girls in New York are forced to sell their virtue for bread….\n\n“There are thirty men in the United States whose aggregate wealth is over one and one-half billion dollars. There are half a million looking for work…. We want money, land and transportation. We want the abolition of the National Banks, and we want the power to make loans direct from the government. We want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out…. We will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary, and we will not pay our debts to the loan-shark companies until the Government pays its debts to us.\n“The people are at bay, let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware” (p. 288).\n\nFor those (like me until now) who’ve always thought only the best of Teddy Roosevelt, the following two direct quotes – not to mention William James’s rejoinder – might be a bit of a news-breaker: “(i)n strict confidence…I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one” (p. 297). And in his address to the Naval War College, he has this to say: “(a)ll the great masterful races have been fighting races…. No triumph of peace is quite so great as the supreme triumph of war” (p. 300). Thankfully – and from James – comes the sobering suggestion that he (Roosevelt) “gushes over war as the ideal condition of human society, for the manly strenuousness which it involves, and treats peace as a condition of blubberlike and swollen ignobility, fit only for huckstering weaklings, dwelling in gray twilight and heedless of the higher life…” (p. 300).\n\nFor those who think Obama’s recent initiative at a rapprochement with Cuba bodes well for that impoverished Caribbean island, you might want to consider what another historian, Philip Foner, writes about the last time (towards the end of the nineteenth century) this country took a keen interest in Old Havana: “(e)ven before the Spanish flag was down in Cuba, U. S. business interests set out to make their influence felt. Merchants, real estate agents, stock speculators, reckless adventurers, and promoters of all kinds of get-rich schemes flocked to Cuba by the thousands. Seven syndicates battled each other for control of the franchises for the Havana Street Railway, which were finally won by Percival Farquhar, representing the Wall Street interests of New York. Thus, simultaneously with the military occupation began … commercial occupation” (p. 310).\n\nBut it gets even better on the other side of the planet, and the same William James who pronounced upon the clearly bellicose character of Teddy Roosevelt has the last word on American behavior in the Pacific: “God dam* the U. S. for its vile conduct in the Philippine Isles” (p. 315).\n\nAnd on that same subject, consider what none other than Mark Twain has to say: “(w)e have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors; furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable patriots; subjugated the remaining ten millions by Benevolent Assimilation, which is the pious new name of the musket; we have acquired property in the three hundred concubines and other slaves of our business partner, the Sultan of Sulu, and hoisted our protecting flag over that sway.\n“And so, by these Providences of God – and the phrase is the government’s, not mine – we are a World Power” (p. 316).\n\nWhere, by the way, was all of this war-mongering and industrial development at breakneck speed headed? Zinn’s choice of a quote from Sinclair Lewis’s BABBITT couldn’t be more appropriate: “(i)t was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.\n“He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and disliked himself for disliking them” (pp. 383-384).\n\nTwo more brief quotes from Howard Zinn himself, and then I’ll conclude. On p. 636, “(w)e may, in the coming years, be in a race for the mobilization of middle-class discontent.” And almost immediately following, on p. 637, “(c)apitalism has always been a failure for the lower classes. It is now beginning to fail for the middle classes.”\n\nI suggested, at the beginning of this review, that Howard Zinn had a “unique view of American history.” That suggestion was in no sense ironic or tongue-in-cheek. After a couple of weeks and 700+ pages, I can only say that this is some of the most valuable reading time I’ve ever spent.\n\nI’m humbled – and yes, also somewhat ashamed – that I’ve discovered this historian and his work at the very ripe old age of 64. I obviously wish it could’ve been sooner. But as it was not, the next best thing I could do was give my copy of A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, still slightly warm to the touch, to my daughter on the occasion of her 21st birthday.\n\nGod willing, she’ll grow up better informed than I – at the very least, about the country whose passport she carries.\n\nRRB\n06/08/15\nBrooklyn, NY",
    "Everyone needs to read this book. To say it is eye-opening would be an understatement. It is one of the rare history books that tells the truth about America. The genocide of the Native Americans, slavery, exploitation of the poor whites, government controlled by the corporations, wars fought purely for business interests, plus much much more. There is also this myth that America's politicians have only recently being influenced by corporations, money and greed when in fact the truth is they have been corrupt from the very beginning. Jefferson, Washington, Adams were not any different from the current crop, they were all crooks. Howard Zinn is a truly remarkable and brave man for having the courage to write such a masterpiece.",
    "What a disgraceful one it is to, mind you the UK's social history is not much more edifying than theirs.\nOnly that their treatment of their people has been more brutal than our's has been.\nIt is absolutely ridiculous spending over fifty percent of their GNP on arms, mind you what do we need two aircraft carriers for? and then building up the national debt by importing goods from China that could be produced in the US, and therefore creating more jobs.\nAnd creating more money to be available for spending on welfare, and the infrastructure of the country.",
    "Beginning with Columbus' in 1492, Howard Zinn gives us a history of Amerika from below. From the framing of the constitution the game has been rigged in favour of the elite, the rich, the political establishment and business - especially BIG business. A relentless struggle of poor rich folk against the huddled masses by any means possible, including murder, secret surveillance, ballot rigging and vested interest lawmaking.I knew some of the history before reading this addictive account, but much of it was new to me. Immigrants from the Mayflower onwards, regardless of ethnicity, ruthlessly exploited for their labour and denied decent wages, housing and working conditions. The struggle continues to this day,and every day the USA becomes more and more polarised.\n\"I wonder who they are, the men who really run this land.........\"",
    "I have always taken the view that a summary but valid means of assessing a country is to view the numbers of people trying to get in as opposed to the reverse.\nAs an Irish person, this has enabled a more positive view of my country in recent decades.\nAnd so I have always been positively disposed towards the US, a country I have visited many times and been in probably half the states.\nThis book provides a convincing and totally more negative perception.\nAnd definitely worth reading!",
    "This is perhaps one of the most important histories of America, showing the reality of a brutal, corporate led semi militarized state that underlies its projected image of freedom, democracy and the American success story. This is essential corrective reading for anyone who is interested in America and in understanding it's political development."

    "-If you have inconsistent or poor performances on your team, you NEED to read this book!\n-If you are the type of leader that is \"too nice\" and you feel like your employees take advantage of you, you NEED to read this book!\n-If your employees are terrified of you, you NEED to read this book!\n\nThis is how this book changed my life:\n\nMy first big promotion was getting the General Manager position of a restaurant at 21 years old, and I did everything I could to make my employees happy (bringing the principals from \"First Break All the Rules- What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently\" which is also imperative to help you measure and understand how to make an amazing work environment for your employees), and it worked wonders- at first. My employees were happy and my customer reviews sky rocketed!!\n\nHowever, over time some employees started to push the lines of respect with me and others, and some just started to outright ignore me or give me attitude. I was devastated! How could they treat me disrespectfully after I had spent months bending over backwards finding out and giving them everything they needed to be happy at work??? I praised them tirelessly, I thanked them constantly, I encouraged them, I personally trained them, I got them equipment and supplies they need to do a good job, I was spending one-on-one time with each of them would ask how their lives were, etc! I was the \"nicest boss....\" who was also turning out to be a pushover.\n\nYou can have all the kindness in the world but it makes your team useless if you have no discipline at the same time! The Bible says God disciplines His children BECAUSE He loves us. Otherwise, we turn into monsters! Which is what I was beginning to experience with my team.\n\nI HAD NO DISCIPLINE, and NEITHER DID MY TEAM. Why would they respect me? I thought discipline was bad- \"punishment\" you gave and \"punishment\" was mean. Nope... turns out every team needs it, and if you are CONSISTENTLY and FAIRLY giving predictable and fore-warned discipline all the time, along with kindness, which Sun Tzu talks about in the book as well, you will have an amazing team. This is my favorite quote from the book that finally turned the light bulb on for me:\n\nPage 26 #42-45:\n\n\"If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\nTherefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.\nIf in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\nIf a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.\"\n\nAND YES IT WAS! Over time, not only did my employees love coming into work EVEN MORE, but they worked harder, my customers were happier, and so was I. People are comforted to know their boss will always be kind AND fair. If you never know how your boss will treat you, it creates uncertainty and anxiety with the team that always leaks out to the customers.\n\nIt took me only a couple weeks to begin fully implementing this mindset with my employees. At first, I'm not going to lie- it shocked them a bit and they didn't believe when me I would tell them I would be disciplining them if they didn't follow through or finish a direct order I had given them. I had to fire one manager who was undermining me to the team, and then everyone saw I was serious and fell right into line. Of course, I did all of this will extreme kindness.\n\nDiscipline should never be nasty or hateful or done when you are fuming angry. The employees need kind, proper and consistent warnings before they receive any consequences (which I learned to start doing right from onboarding them at orientation- saved me a lot of time and trouble), and then if and when the time comes for the formal discipline, they know by then that it was totally their choice, and you are only following through on what you said would happen.\n\nThere are SO MANY MORE GREAT QUOTES in this book. Just get it. Get a highlighter and pick out the diamonds that you need. Go over them time and again and become the amazing leader of your life and of your team you are meant to be!",
    "Good summary book, but some things could be improved. The seller should explicitly disclose this copy as being both a condensed summary and a modern translation, which is important to people seeking the original words. I also think they could have made the size more pocket-friendly since it's less than 100 pages; maybe shave an inch off both the height and width.",

    "Great read highly recommend",
    "\"The Art of War\" is a compendium of the military experience and wisdom of Sun Tzu, which is an honorific given to the author, Sun Wu. It was written over two millennium ago. Naturally there are varying theories and disputes as to who actually wrote it, and which version is correct. There is also the matter of the proper translation. The one I read was translated by Lionel Giles in 1910. It is one of the most, if not the most influential text on military strategy and tactics. Mao Zedong, Vo Nguyen Giap and Douglas MacArthur are only three of the many military leaders who credit the importance of Sun Tzu work in guiding their thinking. It remains an essential \"textbook\" at the military colleges in the United States, and is also required reading in the CIA. I finally decided to read this classic in search of a specific quote that I had been told was from Sun Tzu's work, and which I had had some personal experience with: \"Never fight on a battlefield that resembles an inverted tortoise shell.\" I didn't find the quote, but perhaps I found the opposite. At least the tortoise shell reference SOUNDS like something he might have said.\n\nThe author did grab my attention with an anecdote in the introduction which underscored one of his aphorisms: \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders are clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\" In the anecdote, it is women who are divided into two sides, each led by one of the emperor's favorite concubines. Because they could not maintain proper discipline among their \"troops,\" each of the concubines is beheaded, despite the protests of the emperor. It should be no surprise that their replacements achieved perfect discipline within the ranks, and Sun Tzu, who proclaimed the army ready, had the temerity to rebuke the emperor with: \"The King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds.\" (How often such a speaker, in the real world, can keep his own head is not discussed in the text.)\n\nThere is much wisdom in this text. For example: \"All warfare is based on deception.\" \"There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.\" On a good leader: \"Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilize combined energy.\" And one that Vo Nguyen Giap must have taken to heart: \"Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\" (that is, he did not repeat the tactics that led to victory at Dien Binh Phu by repeating them at Khe Sanh; instead he went for Saigon, and the American public via television)\n\nAs for that \"inverted tortoise shell,\" the one passage that seemed closest to addressing this issue seemed to imply the opposite: \"Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.\" And, \"Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.\" (Certainly Giap seemed to have disregarded that one). And there seems to be that \"classic problem\" of all too many \"holy\" books. There are passages that imply \"this\", and passages that imply the opposite of \"this.\" For example, on the all-important matter of logistics and supply, Sun Tzu says: \"Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy,\" and \"Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own.\" But on the other hand: \"We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost, without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\"\n\nThere is much good advice that seems to be routinely ignored, despite its place in the curriculum, such as the emphasis on short, decisive wars and the repeated admonitions to know the enemy. Conversely, there are the passages that can be chosen to buttress one argument, and others to buttress the counter-argument. Overall, 4-stars.",

    "Every woman needs to read this book and every person who loves a woman should read this book. I can’t believe it has taken me this many years to read this. I am 44 and have learned so much. How to be safer but not be worried. How to trust my intuition but not be overly concerned by the fear in the world. What a true gift Gavin has given to all of the world with this book.",
    "EXCELLENT BOOK!! Every man should buy these and have their wives, girlfriends, children, especially daughters, read this book! And buy several of these and hand them out to his friends, especially women and teenage girls he knows! A GREAT book, a quick read, very interesting and informative. An excellent book for everyday living in a dangerous world.",
    "This book is essential for women in particular who can be an easy target, partly because we are less strong than men and partly because we have been trained to be nice and ignore our instincts. I had just dipped into this book recently when I went for a walk today in the woods a mile from my house. It was a Tuesday morning around 10am and it's in a very safe, upscale neighborhood. I've walked in the woods many times. But more recently, I've started picking up a stick at the start of my walk for self-defense if necessary. And this time, for some reason, my instincts were not to have my head phones in so I could hear what was going on. Anyway, I entered the park and started to walk across a little bridge over a creek and saw a dog darting ahead of me. I thought to pet the dog, but this voice told me to check where the owner was. I looked behind me and the owner-- a good looking white guy in his late 30's-- had been walking really quietly behind me. (I think he even saw me enter the park and pick up my protection stick.) But, here's where the book helped me. As my mind was saying, \"He's a nice guy, he has a dog, he's harmless, and look he's talking to me about what a lovely morning it is\", my deeper instinct was reminding me of this book. Here are a few things-- 1) Forced Teaming-- when they use \"we\" and don't even know you. He said, \"What a beautiful morning we have today.\" (It's a way to establish trust.) 2) Charm and Niceness-- he was good looking and charming, but charm is not a trait but rather something that anyone can act out, and this guy was using charm to engage and disarm me. This guy seemed nice, but when I looked into his eyes, they were black-- that's how dilated his pupils were. 3) Too many details-- he was describing in detail how beautiful the light was ahead of us on the trail, trying to beckon me up there, where I could not longer be seen from the road. His dog was already up there, what was the big deal? I sensed danger. Also, 4) Discounting the word no. I didn't say no, but I didn't respond to his comments, and he didn't respect my boundaries. I had a choice to listen to my head (which was slower to catch up and still trying to be nice) vs. my instincts, which I did. I turned around with my stick in my hand and walked past him out of the park to safety. (I could have tried to walk away from him but that would have taken me into the middle of the woods, where I couldn't be seen or heard.) Anyway, I walked quickly and purposely. He almost tried to block me, but I just kept going toward the open gate, knowing that others would see or hear me, which he knew. I think his eyes were black because he hadn't expected me to respond that way. He thought he could lure me further into the woods by charming me to check out the light in the trees up the hill. I interrupted his plan. Thank God I had my stick, no headphones and this book in my mind.\n\nThis book made all the difference. So many times women who have been attacked/raped describe how nice their attacker seemed seconds before. When I saw that his eyes had turned black and he had zero interest in that dog (who I think was a prop to get women to respond to him), I knew I had to get out and I did, thank God. Please buy this book and share-- it doesn't matter that it's 20 years old-- same thing applies today and then.",
    "Still reading it and might do a round two just to re-analyse it and gain new insight. The author incorporates the use of diverse stylistic devices to present the overall theme of the book which is, listening to our intuition/gut instincts. I think I will have to come back here and rewrite this review in a more in-depth manner. I just love the book and had to say something. It would be a perfect present for anyone, especially, for women in today's society! Thanks Gavin! :)",

    "I spent 20 years on the streets in local law enforcement. I always felt that the Temporary Restraining Orders (TRO) we served on stalkers and spousal abusers were as worthless, in most cases, as the paper they were written on. Usually they simply served as a salve to sooth our justice system's guilt over unwillingness or inability to take strong and immediate action, or develop alternative solutions. As Gavin de Becker so aptly points out, when it comes to committed stalkers and abusers, not only are they not afraid of a piece of paper, it incents them to even a higher degree of activity and perhaps violence. The author makes an excellent case that we should be much more judicious in evaluating such cases against a threat matrix and respond in different ways depending on the nature of the threat.\n\nI also greatly appreciate the author's discussion of the origins of fear and how important it has been in allowing mankind to develop. In addition to the twenty years I spent in law enforcement, I am also a Certified Body Language trainer and teach the power of nonverbal communication. As research has shown, what we call women's intuition is in reality the fact that women, on average, are far better at picking up nonverbal cues than men. That \"intuition\" was absolutely essential for the females of our species to survive in a very hostile world, where they were of slighter stature and needed to quickly detect threats around them. As the primary caregiver to children they also needed to be able to effectively interpret the cues and needs of infants and small children before spoken language.\n\nOne interesting study involved showing short film clips with the sound turned off to groups of men and women. Women scored an incredible 87% accuracy in evaluating the situation shown in the video. Afraid guys we only scored 42%. fMRI scans reveal women use 14-16 regions of their brains during communication, while men only 4-6 areas (most women probably would dispute giving us that much credit-:)\n\nIn modern society, in the interest of being \"polite\", we often suppress our natural intuition, our gut feelings. Back in my police career we didn't even have a term called Body Language. We only knew it as \"street-smarts\". One of my great fears has to do with my beautiful wife's suppression of her natural intuition around strangers, in the interest of being polite and non-judgemental. The nature of my our respective careers requires us to live in a dense urban area, surrounded by all sorts of threats. Dark parking lots, underground garages, elevators and streets filled with street people and drug addicts. While our building is very secure, once you are on the streets it's a whole different ball game. She has terrific intuition when she uses it. She is like a perfectly honed tuning fork when she is willing to trust her intuition, but due to her kind and trusting nature, she often suppresses it in the interest of being all-inclusive and accepting.\n\nGavin de Becker's loud message to women, Trust your gut, Don't suppress your intuition, Don't worry about hurting some stranger's feelings is a powerful one. It is my hope that my wife and every woman will be willing to read the book, reflect on all the powerful stories in The Gift of Fear, including the author's personal story.",
    "I have actually read the book before but wanted to purchase it. Recommend this book to everyone.",
    "I found this book disappointing. The main tenet is that we all have inbuilt intuition when we are at risk of violence and that we should listen to that intuition to protect ourselves. I think it's common sense that this is partially true but I think De Becker exaggerates the extent of this intuition. As evidence he recounts a number of victim's stories, unfortunately he makes no effort to explore if this is merely hindsight bias. *After* a traumatic event it's easy to think back at all the ways it could have been different and find significance in mere coincidences.\n\nInstead of buying this book and wading through his self-promotion you could just tell yourself \"be more alert in dangerous situations and act if you feel threatened\" the end result is the same....",
    "This is one of the most influential books I have read and is one of a triplet of books that I recommend to anyone who deals with people in difficult situations on a regular basis such as coppers, medics, and mental health workers. The other two books are: Meditations On Violence by Rory Miller and The Games People Play by Eric Berne.\n\nThe premise of the book, in a nutshell, is: trust your instincts. The author takes you through the way your brain processes threats and the fact that, to your brain, it's a binary matter - stay or get the hell out of there. It doesn't consider that you need to know the ins and outs of why there is a threat, you just need to know that's the situation is dangerous and you need to do something about it. It highlights how the analytical part of your brain is too slow and by the time you realise why you are in danger it could be too late. The author takes the reader through a number of scenarios where the victim's life is saved by trusting their instincts and then breaks them down so that you can see what the warning signs were - warning signs missed by the conscious mind but picked up by the subconscious.\n\nFrom there, the book takes the subject of risk very wide and includes advice on how to deal with obsessive people and stalkers and details their mindsets.\n\nThere is far too much to go into in an Amazon review but suffice to say The Gift of Fear provides an excellent guide to the psychology of people you would be better off avoiding and why, if you get a bad feeling about a person or a situation, you are probably right.\n\nThe Gift of Fear is highly readable. De Becker makes frequent use of anecdotes to highlight his principles and this prevents the book from becoming too bogged down in technical detail. I have read this book about four times now and I refer back to parts of it frequently. I do not consider myself to be particularly academic so most people should not find it to be too hard going. It is a solid, practical guide to risk, how to spot it, and why understanding what the risk is, is something best considered afterwards from a safe distance. It's extremely useful for keeping yourself safe but also provides a number of principles that can be used to advise others.",
    "Everything I read was simply common sense. Every page is a variant of the same mantra: If he gives you a weird feeling, listen to your gut and get out of there. And yes, that’s a ‘he’, because it seems like most of the book is aimed at men as the assailants in the forms of murderers, rapists etc. Don’t waste your time reading this, I read the first 20 pages and was unenlightened, and further disappointed by the lack of progress. If only this was grounds for a refund.",
    "This book was recommended to me and I can thoroughly recommend it too. It gives a very interesting insight into using your intuition in everyday life and how fear can be a gift because it's telling you something very important but also how not to let it rule your life. Although all the examples are USA based it's still very relevant to the UK. I've taken De Becker's advise onboard and now feel more confident in uncomfortable situations. There's an excellent chapter on how to recognise controlling and possibly violent people that is the ultimate checklist for anyone who's in a questionable relationship",
    "It is a very useful book though towards the last chapters it becomes a bit boring. Also it overemphasizes how the employees can be dangerous for the companies and co-workers but it overlooks the fact that the employers can also be dangerous to the employees - bullying from managers is quite common and dangerous. I recommend the book though."

    "Doctor & public intellectual Atul Gawande’s 2014 book Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End basically deserves all the praise it receives. Although it is more about modern aging then about death per se, it certainly fit my mood at the moment. My father, a brain cancer patient in his mid-60s, has been given a push along on this path, so it was still helpful to me to think about aging and decline more generally (significant decline prior to death will happen even in most best-case scenarios — and anyways you can’t know in advance if it really won’t).\n\nBeing Mortal essentially provides a long, thoughtful, multi-faceted, historically-grounded complaint about the medicalization of aging and death, from someone who really knows and cares. Older adults may become less capable of caring for themselves in various ways, but for the most part they still want the things they always wanted: autonomy in their schedules and surroundings, community, privacy, a specific and concrete reason to get up in the morning. It’s a hell of a demand, to ask people to adjust to completely new surroundings and routines when they’ve never been older and/or sicker.\n\nInstitutions like hospitals and nursing homes are sort of good at providing some things (specific instances of treatment) and terrible at providing others (emotional warmth, exceptions to the rules, etc). The “assisted living” concept has an interesting history (read it in the book!). Unfortunately, by now assisted living has become a watered-down way station between hospital and nursing home, rather than remaining a bastion of alternative values in elder care as originally conceived.\n\nIndeed, the logic of institutions is largely inexorable. If providing meaning (or a lifestyle ripe for it) cannot be measured and incentivized, it will not be reliably or scalably produced.\n\nAdmittedly, Being Mortal raises more questions than it provides answers. Everyone loves a good news story about kindergarteners who visit nursing homes. But are they changing diapers? Is there really any feasible model for caring for a rapidly aging population other than institutions? And how are you supposed to reward institutions for preserving meaning (an inherently individual task) even while they do the things that institutions are meant to do – get a lot of services provided quickly/reliably in a standardized fashion?\n\nNo individual person can change the system anyways, but it does seem that (even within the system we’ve got) people are making some crap decisions. Ok, so people are valuing the wrong things – namely, safety over autonomy and the “lottery ticket” of survival/recovery over a better death, sooner. You’re someone who wants to value the right things. So what do you do?\n\nYou have to do your own research and ask doctors hard questions, because they don’t really like facing imminent death either. You have to broaden your imagination about what acceptable living arrangements for an older person might look like.For instance, maybe you have to accept that your loved one might not get medicine exactly on time or the diet just as the doctor prescribed, because he’s going to sleep in his own bed and raid his own fridge instead. But maybe people don’t want to do those things. Then what?\n\nThat brings us to my main quibble with Being Mortal: Gawande waffles a bit between what people do value and what they should value. It’s so tempting to talk a big game about what “matters.” But if something really matters, why don’t people choose it? Don’t lots of different things matter? And how could it ever be anything less than very difficult to switch from life mode (focus on safety and the long-term) to end-of-life mode?\n\nPerhaps Gawande ought to have sought out some different examples of these values in action. It’s not too hard to imagine a terminal patient forgoing last-ditch treatment, even if it’s not what we’d choose ourselves. It’s much more difficult to imagine a role model of, for instance, an adult child allowing her parent to live in what are widely considered to be “unsafe” living conditions specifically for the sake of that parent’s broader well-being.\n\nI want to see examples of real “free-range” senescence. I’d like to read the account of someone who got a call from the police, who found mom passed out in the yard, or even whose parent died in an accidental house fire or something.\n\nMany worst-case scenarios (of elders living unaided) will not come to pass, but some certainly will. Then what? Does that change people’s minds, one way or the other? Like trendy “free-range parenting,” it’s probably just much easier said than done. Does that mean a value is going unrealized, or that the person doesn’t hold it in the first place?\n\nMaybe many patients don’t even know what they value the most. That’s fair, and part of what palliative care can help them to define, as it becomes increasingly relevant. But maybe there’s nothing satisfying to uncover. There’s no rule that everyone must necessarily value different components of life in a stable fashion. Some people will have very consistent desires, but others will vacillate (especially as they experience the stages of progressing towards death). If you draw a patient’s attention to the dangers of her living independently, she shudders. But when you tell a sad story about a nursing home, she cringes. Maybe she fights with her adult children about where she should go. Maybe she can’t afford her first choice. But that’s simple interpersonal conflict and lack of resources, not unique to old age.\n\nYou can’t live both independently and in a nursing home. Something’s got to give, and that totally sucks. Some values will be pursued better, and some values will be pursued worse, and some kind of balance must be reached. Care institutions put a finger on the scale, but they didn’t create the problem.\n\nThe personal economy of value pursuit is simply tricky, from the day we’re born until the day we die. Gawande knows that there are costs associated to the “old” way of dying – it tends to create autonomy for elders at the expense of the younger generation, especially women sandwiched between their children and parents. Many children (and parents) aren’t happy with this anymore, for a variety of reasons, so they face new sets of options (i.e. tradeoffs). Having access to medicine is a double-edged sword, and like many historically-novel conditions humans aren’t inherently well-equipped to deal with it. There’s no technocratic solution to that. If “dying as we lived” is some kind of standard for how we should go, then maybe alone and medicalized makes some sense right now after all.\n\nI don’t really have any caveats in recommending this one, though. Just read it (and then try to forget Gawande’s description of how aging bodies feel in a surgeon’s hands as quickly as possible).\n\nBook #3 for read about death dot com",
    "Apparently, I’m a slow learner.\n\nYou would think that when your daughter-in-law encourages you to read a book—you would read it. Ditto book recommendations from your wife.\n\nMelinda and Joanne—sorry it took me a year to read this. But thank you. Because “Being Mortal” is now on my Top-10 book list for 2018.\n\nIn this riveting book, Dr. Atul Gawande reminds us: “People die only once.” So when facing fork-in-the-road sick and dying decisions, “They have no experience to draw on. They need doctors and nurses who are willing to have the hard discussions and say what they have seen, who will help people prepare for what is to come—and escape a warehouse oblivion that few really want.”\n\n“Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End” changed—totally changed—my thoughts about end-of-life decisions. Whew. On one level, I agree that this New York Times bestseller (7,000 reviews on Amazon!) is a brilliant and deep look at the “…still unresolved argument about what the function of medicine really is—what, in other words, we should and should not be paying for doctors to do.” Yet on another surprising level, this writer (four bestsellers), surgeon, and public health leader—delivers fresh management and leadership insights in every chapter.\n\nCUSTER OR ROBERT E. LEE? The author says that medicine’s job is to fight death and disease—the enemy—but that the enemy eventually wins. “And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”\n\nYet Gawande admits, “More often, these days, medicine seems to supply neither Custers nor Lees. We are increasingly the generals who march the soldiers onward, saying all the while, ‘You let me know when you want to stop.’ All-out treatment, we tell the incurably ill, is a train you can get off at any time—just say when. But for most patients and their families we are asking too much. They remain riven by doubt and fear and desperation; some are deluded by a fantasy of what medical science can achieve.”\n\nWhat should families do? My suggestion: ask your doctor (like I did this week) if he or she has read “Being Mortal.” (He had.) Gawande notes that medical school taught him two styles of doctor/patient interactions: paternalistic and informative.\n\nThe “paternalistic relationship” is the “priestly, doctor-knows-best model, and although often denounced it remains a common mode, especially with vulnerable patients—the frail, the poor, the elderly, and anyone else who tends to do what they’re told.”\n\nDoctors make the critical choices. “If there were a red pill and a blue pill, we would tell you, ‘Take the red pill. It will be good for you.’ We might tell you about the blue pill; but then again, we might not.”\n\nThe “informative relationship” sounds good, at first. “’Here’s what the red pill does, and here’s what the blue pill does,’ we would say, ‘Which one do you want?’ It’s a retail relationship. The doctor is the technical expert. The patient is the consumer.”\n\nThe down side? Doctors become “ever more specialized” and “We know less and less about our patients but more and more about our science.” He writes, “In truth, neither type is quite what people desire. We want information and control, but we also want guidance.” In his medical school, there was also the brief mention of a third type of doctor-patient relationship often labeled “interpretive.”\n\n“Here the doctor’s role is to help patients determine what they want. Interpretive doctors ask, ‘What is most important to you? What are your worries?’ Then, when they know your answers, they tell you about the red pill and the blue pill and which one would most help you achieve your priorities.”\n\nMakes sense right? Gawande notes that this relationship is also called “shared decision making” and added, “It seemed to us medical students a nice way to work with patients as physicians. But it seemed almost entirely theoretical. Certainly, to the larger medical community, the idea that most doctors would play this kind of role for patients seemed far-fetched at the time. (Surgeons? ‘Interpretive?’ Ha!)”\n\nBut two decades later, the author describes a meeting with his father (also a surgeon) and his father’s neurosurgeon. The task: review the MRI images of his father’s giant and deadly tumor. The neurosurgeon “saw himself as neither the commander nor a mere technician in the battle but instead as a kind of counselor and contractor on my father’s behalf. It was exactly what my father needed.”\n\nTo get the conversation going in your family, maybe insert a reminder into your Thanksgiving prayer next Thursday that everyone around the table will die only once! Then, mention this book as required reading for at least one family member. (“Grammy—please pass the turkey and that Being Mortal book.”)\n\nDr. Gawande is an amazing writer. The poignant stories are page-turners. The innovative solutions—inspiring and encouraging. I’ve already re-told many of the memorable fork-in-the-road stories (tears will flow) to friends and colleagues and ordered the book for several friends. Be sure to read the hilarious story of the very creative nursing home that added two dogs, four cats, and 100 parakeets! (Memo to Purchasing: Next time, order the cages before the birds are delivered!)\n\nI should have jumped on this 2014 book much, much sooner—because I still rave about Gawande’s 2010 insightful bestseller, “The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.”\n\nI had no idea that there were checklist connoisseurs! “The Checklist Manifesto” moves eloquently through medicine, aeronautics, and sky-scraper construction—noting why checklists will make or break a venture. For example, Boeing’s checklist expert uses “pause points” when designing checklists for pilots in crisis. Within each pause point, he limits the checklist to between five and nine items.\n\nAs a staff writer for the New Yorker, Gawande’s latest article, “Why Doctors Hate Their Computers,” was published on Nov. 12, 2018. You can read or listen to the article online. (Customer Bucket Pop Quiz: Are computer systems for the doctors or for the patients?)\n\nAnd—get this—Gawande is also CEO of the health care venture formed by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase to deliver better outcomes, satisfaction, and cost efficiency in care. Stay tuned!",
    "Facing one's mortality is hard, but harder still is facing the mortality of our loved ones. I put off reading this book, just like we put off having the hard conversations. But it is a must read. It provides an honest view of the end that most of us have to face, but it also provides a kind of toolset to help with the process, what to look for, what to expect, and how to prepare. I can't say I enjoyed reading this book, but I'm very grateful that this book exists. Thank you Dr.Gawande.",
    "This book had been chosen as my latest book club choice because we all decided that it would challenge us. There is no doubt of that as we all contemplate the concept of mortality - of peers, parents and our own. All of the group have parents who are elderly, dying or already dead which present constant dilemmas for those left to care or take responsibility in any way.\nThe book is just over 280 pages, split into eight chapters by subject.\nI was slightly scared to read this book as I expected it to force me to confront emotions that I usually bury. And it's true that there were some very familiar issues dealt with regarding the quality of life and the moralities of the healthcare system forcing people to live longer than they actually should be able to.\nThe narrative is very easy to read . It is direct, not avoiding difficult subjects and discussing decline/death in the way that you would hope of a physician.\nIt should be noted that this is a US author so the statistics and examples are all from the US. The easiest way to approach this from the UK is assume that everything is the same here but, of course, that isn't necessarily true.\nMany problems are raised with the system but, unsurprisingly, not too many solutions are discussed. It is never going to solve problems but will provoke thought which I think is its main purpose. The ideas that are raised are very plausible though and worthy of trying out.\nThere are many points in the book where the author theorises and I thought that it was much more effective when he used real examples to illustrate what he is trying to say.\nHe tackles geriatric care very openly but when he moves on to the mortality of terminally ill younger people the book becomes more controversial - money is always a limiting factor and we are asked to think about whether extending a life temporarily (and miserably) is sensible - he actually refers to this option being the \"default choice\" of many people in the medical world.",
    "I first got interested in death and in the process of dying in year 2000, after my Mum's death. Her illness and death went - somehow - all wrong. In this book Atul Gawande explains what can go wrong, and why. My Mum got it all and more. We, the family, were neither prepared nor able to find for her (and for ourselves) a better way to get to the end. If you put in the picture that in Italy - maybe \"the\" Catholic Country of all - physical pain has always been regarded as the sacred way to get to heaven, (a mentality that is still lingering here and there) - then you can imagine what she went through. Since those days I have red endless books on death and dying: this is undoubtedly one of the best. What people do not understand is that books on these subject are deep, rich, intense and help you to live a better life. If we only could talk freely about death and dying, our life would be richer and happier.",
    "I enjoyed this book more than any other I have read for a long, long time. It was recommended to me by my daughter's radiographer at Sick Kids Hospital in Edinburgh. I have no medical knowledge but the whole book is so brilliantly written for both medics and laymen. Funny, tragic, fascinating and wholly accurate. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this book. It gave me so much food for thought. I laughed and cried and highlighted parts franctically throughout. I hope this book will start many new discussions within medical professionals and families alike. Each life 'story' in the book is crucial to the bigger picture. I will read this book again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Thank you for writing such a succinct, self-effacing, encouraging, depressing, and informative read. And thanks to your friends, family and patients for sharing their stories.",
    "I thought I once picked up this book and it contained the quote by Bette Davis saying ‘old age ain’t for sissies’ which I loved. I also thought it contained another quote about who wants to live to 99 with a whole range of health problems that might include poor eyesight and hearing loss, on a dialysis machine and taking every medicine under the sun just to keep breathing - answer; the person with all this who is aged 98. However, neither of these are in this book so I thought I would add them to this review. I love both those quotes and would love to know what book I did actually read these quotes from.\n- In this book the author, Atul Gwande (a man someone should make a saint) has written a book about death that is full of hope. He looks at how we can better manage and have a good death. Previously most of us died at home but now the majority of us die in hospitals attached to drips and adding to the prolonged memory of end-of-life care.\n- Man has spent most of the 200 - 300,000 years of existence on this planet, with an average life expectancy of living to the ages of 30 or 40. It is only in the last century that we start to live in longer lives and move from living to an average age of 30 or 40 to an average age of 70 or 80, and our bodies have to adjust the fact that we are ageing and this is not necessarily a natural course of events but we are kept alive for these long periods of time for many people through medicines and healthcare and understanding how we can do this. However, do we really want to then end our final few years separated from loved ones, living in an institution and buried by a mass of tubes keeping us barely conscious.\n- This book is a fascinating look at how we view ageing and how we might wish to end our days or those of a loved one. Ending up in an institutions such as nursing homes have been likened to a similar institutionalisation that you would resemble prisons or mental facility for people with mental health problems, it's not dignified, it's often neglect where old people lose all the sense of dignity that they may have had whilst being independently living on their own, and be given nightdresses and institutionalised clothes with wardens going around making sure you behave in a certain way and do the right thing and end up being treated like a child or someone beneath them. Just because you're in an institution where you are cared for and there is a lot of care going on doesn't mean that they can make you fit in with scheduled events and where everything is regimented once they have your money.\n- However if the alternative is to put the black the burden on a family member such as a daughter who is usually in often is, then they are now the carer and provided medicine, providing meals, and having to deal with people alongside their house rules. So the emphasis of care provided by a carer can be equally bleak and difficult on both parties such as the family member and the older person who requires care.\n- So if we don't like institutions and we feel we can't put the burden of care on family members, what is the solution? Another idea suggested is assisted living where people have their own houses and their own privacy, dignity and ability to control but also have the opportunity to meet other people, and have basic care when provided and necessary. Old people aren't called patients but are known as tenants and in this setting might be a better alternative. Even when people are old and frail and possibly losing memory and some faculties, we still need to ask the question: what is it that makes life live it worth living and what is a good life even when we might have other areas of concern and be old and frail.\n- Rachel Carson was somebody who looked at Maslow's motivation of needs approach and noted that actually it was how perspectives can change for older people because they have a different perspective on life than younger people do. When young, you feel they're going to live forever and you're motivated by work goals and making a career. But as you age, your perspectives change - many people get less depressed and feel the more important things are close relationships with families and friends. Your days are limited, you become aware of the fact, your perspective on what’s important changes. In fact, how we perceive everything can help us lead better lives.\n- However many of the institutionalised independent living places really turned into more like institutions. For what is a better life after all many of these frail people suffer from the three plagues of boredom, loneliness and frailty so could we turn places such as nursing homes into something that tries to manage boredom, loneliness and helplessness? The author also looks at life and what it means that we have to care and be connected to one another and we'll see what will happen to people even after we die. There are very few people that would ever want to imagine that when they die, an hour later everyone else would be wiped off the planet earth, we care what will happen to people after we've gone and for some, dying is the gift that they can help those left behind feel better about the death of a parent or loved one.\n- The book then switches to a young mother who is giving birth to a baby but through that operation they discover that she has lung cancer and it is terminal. She is a non-smoker (note: 50% of people who have lung cancer are non-smokers). She was then given several courses of treatment and to which she will still probably live no more than a year. The question is what kind of care do we want to give to people who are in the final year of life as 25% of all Medicare in America is spent on people who will have one year left of life and the majority of that money will be spent on the last two months of care before the person dies. Often when people are in the final years or stages of an incurable disease the questions we should be asking are what would they want from this life at this time and what is important. The answers are often creating understanding or close relationships with the people in their lives, filling their lives with some meaning and closure and it's not necessarily about keeping them alive pumped full of drugs, in and out of consciousness in a hospital bed, sent via tubes and barely registering what's going on. However, we don't ask these questions and we should think, is this how I really want to spend my final weeks or days in this way.\n- End-of-life care in terminally ill patients who particularly might have less than a year to live, are often under the management of doctors who continuously try to find something that might extend life by a few months rather than the years they expect. Many patients think further treatments might extend and offer them an extra 20 years of life when in actual fact almost all statistical evidence says that it might give them all three months. When patients are then given palliative care from trained nurses who without the need to stop curative care they can often form better decisions because people start asking them what is important in their life and help them to understand the realities of what is going to occur. Fascinating stuff that we should think about. In many societies where palliative care is the norm rather than further courses of treatment - particularly in countries that don’t have access to the medicines available in America - life expectancy is often longer than those on relentless courses of expensive treatments. It reminds me of a joke in regards to why they stick steel nails into coffins of people who have died of cancer, it's to stop the oncologist coming up with one further bout of treatment. After reading the account of one young lady's decision-making and the whole family's inability to accept what was going on, her life's end of life care was just one about an excessive set of treatments without necessarily looking at what is the best way to die. These are questions we need to be asking ourselves. And palliative care nurses could be the best people to do this.\n- What is also interesting is the end of life care in regards to hospice treatment actually seems to have longer life expectancy than the care that has just given through medical intervention, not by years and only weeks or months, but also it may lead to a better death\n- If we have to face bad news we also have to think about what we want. Do you want the doctor to inform us about the best medical decisions we can make or do we want the doctor to listen to our fears and try to manage that and address those fears. Hope that a better way would be to give us information and guidance but also try to help us make the decisions that we need to do so even a model of that is listening to the patient, giving advice but tempering that advice with what our fears and needs actually are within relation to possible surgery or further treatment. And I guess it's important to remember that lots of medical practitioners just want to try and fix a problem and those conversations are hard.\n- Though Gawande tells many stories in this book - he also talks of his own experiences and of his own family (particularly his dad and grandad). It really helps to crystalise the message that he is telling with this book.\n- I love the author's approach by starting with three words when you want to relate and discuss something that might be hard to tackle, and those words are \"I am worried”.\n- The most amazing thing about this book that is about death is that it's also about a better life to gain some insight and solutions to how we can die - and as Jim Morrison once sang “no one here gets out alive” so it's worth asking these questions now rather than waiting until it's too late. A recommended book on death that tells us a lot about how to live.",
    "Despite its sombre black cover with Golden lettering -- which I personally find very beautiful -- this is not a morbid book about death, as such, but rather the latter moments/years of life and the quality of those years.\n\nBeing Mortal's main focus is on how medicine and medical care has maybe skewed our perception on what it means to live. Does the quality of the life we have at the end often get overshadowed by a focus of extending our life -- even if this extension comes at the cost of stripping our final days of everything that gives meaning to a definition of \"Life\".\n\nThe book begins by investigating the kind of care that is offered to our culture's elderly; a care that can, more often than not, remove as much of their autonomy and dignity as possible in favour of safety. The latter half of the book then moves into discussing the kind of medical direction that is adopted with/by those who are diagnosed as terminally ill.\n\nIn both cases, Dr Gawande, eruditely and with much sensitivity, proposes that a better kind of end-of-life-care would be given, and a better quality/freedom of life would be had, if we moved our focus away from trying to ward off the inevitable and placed it instead on assisting and cultivating what life there is remaining. Gawande's proposition is for a more considered medical approach towards those facing the final chapter of their story; one that would allow people to maintain as much control of their life as possible. In such cases the question is not a matter of \"would we like to live or die\", but what quality of life would we like to have available to us prior to the end, and what levels of quality are we prepared to \"trade\" in order to extend what little time we have left? The concern of medicine and care would therefore be more inclined in providing the patient with an attainable desired life and not putting them through unnecessary cycles of treatments which, inevitably, erode what quality of life could be had whilst giving so little time (if any) back in return. In such an application, the \"well-being\" (physically, mentally and emotionally) of the patient would be more important than treating the incurable.\n\nIn short, could our current medical practice (along with our own expectations of what medicine is for/about) be failing those who are facing death by preventing them from experiencing as much life as is possible in their final moments?\n\nSuch an approach does require us courageously accepting our own mortality; which is a modern challenge in the technological age we live in, and something our ancestors never really struggled with. But this acceptance would lead us towards embracing a life we can have now instead of forfeiting this for something that, sadly, lies beyond our reach.\n\nAt this point, some may be thinking that Being Mortal is about Euthanasia. Although this highly complex ethical issue is briefly discussed within the book's eighth chapter (entitled Courage), the context of the book is not arguing for prematurely bringing someone's life to close (\"assisted dying\"), but improving the quality of life for those who are terminal, and helping them to best prepare, both emotionally and physically, for this end. In other words, this book is arguing for \"assisted living\". That said, I'm certain that both sides of the Euthanasia debate would find much food for thought within Dr Gawande's writing, along with examples that could be taken to both strengthen and challenge their held positions. Personally, I'm not sure whether the topic under discussion within this book would fall under the header of Euthanasia; it could be argued that prolonging treatment to fight a terminal illness that has already won, could lead into an earlier death.\n\nI found this book extremely fascinating, poignant and sobering. I'll admit, at the age of thirty-five, the quality of life I would desire at my own end isn't something I've given much thought to. I have now. Reading this book will certainly have that affect on you. But the book has also made me think a lot about others, especially the elderly I know and love.\n\nDeath, and preparing for it, is such a difficult topic to discuss. So I admire Dr Gawande's courage and compassion as he navigates this issue; and he navigates it very well. To help him in this task, many personal stories from those who have faced this natural crisis have been used; even Atul's own moving description of his father's last years. At first, I found some of the core issues raised by these stories repetitive; wondering whether they could have been condensed together. However, with the hindsight that birthed when I was about three quarters of the way through this book, I became very grateful for every syllable. These personal words help to enlarge our perception of what it means to live; they enable us to grasp how universal our hopes and fears are when it comes to preparing for the end of our own tale.\n\nIt is -- though it may seem a very awkward thing to read in public -- an excellent book. One that maybe we all should read.\n\n-- Tristan Sherwin, author of *Love: Expressed*"

    "This book is 50% biography and 50% science; and it adds up to 100% fascinating. Wow - I couldn't put it down!\n\nI have worked with HeLa cells many times during my career in microbiology, and I've always wondered about the woman from whom they originated. I was always very much aware that behind every one of the medical tests I performed lay a real person whose life might depend on the accuracy and insight of my work. I wanted to know as much as possible about that person, both to keep my focus on the real reason for the work I was doing, and to gain insight that might contribute to the patient's diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAnd although I knew that \"HeLa\" had died in 1951, I felt the same way about working with the cells from her malignant cervical tumor. I wanted to know more about her, to always be aware of and empathetic to the real person and her suffering. But I graduated before Rebecca Skloots did, at a time when even less was known about \"HeLa.\" I didn't know Henrietta Lacks' name, that she was African-American, her age when she died, or how long she was ill; and I had never seen the photo of her that is now so famous. I wondered whether she had any children, and what became of them when she died.\n\nSo I was thrilled when this book came out, and it has been on my \"priority tbr\" list since I first heard of it. It lived up to, and even exceeded, my expectations. It answered all my questions, and brought up many new ones, the answers to some of which may never be known.\n\nHenrietta's life was a hard one. She lost her own mother at the age of four and was raised by her grandparents. Life for her was an endless struggle against poverty. But one thing she did have was a large and close-knit extended family. Even without a mother, she learned well the arts of caring and nurturing; and all of her adult life she fed and took in other family members who needed help. She married a cousin with whom she'd grown up, and they had five children. There doesn't seem to be so much as a hint of a rumor that she ever had any other lover in all her life. But life was unfair to Henrietta. Her husband was a notorious philanderer, with the result that she was constantly plagued by sexually transmitted diseases. One of them - HPV - gave her cervical cancer and was also the reason for her cells' immortality. (Normal cells live for only about 50 divisions, then die. But the HeLa cells cultured from Henrietta's tumor are still living and reproducing sixty years later, and that is what makes them so valuable to science.) Henrietta had three venereal diseases at the same time during her cancer treatments. Her cancer was incredibly aggressive, and she died after months of terrible agony. One can only hope that her spirit survives somewhere to know that the tragedy of her life was given meaning by her contribution to medical science - arguably the most important in the history of medicine.\n\nThe story of Henrietta's older daughter Elsie is even more heartbreaking. She was born deaf, mute, epileptic, and perhaps retarded due to congenital syphilis (meaning she contracted it in her mother's womb. All 5 of the Lacks children suffered neural hearing disabilities from the same cause.) At least one family member believes that Elsie may not have been retarded at all, but was simply unable to communicate due to her deafness. No matter what her IQ might have been, her story is utterly horrifying. A photo of Elsie from when she still lived at home shows her to be a strikingly beautiful child; and also clean, healthy, and happy. But when Henrietta became so ill, she could no longer care for her daughter and Elsie was institutionalized. What happened to the 11-year-old girl in the Crownsville State Hospital for the Negro Insane is so shocking and awful that it's almost unbelievable. This part of the book is very difficult to read, but it's important that people know - both to honor Elsie's memory, and to make sure that such things do not happen again.\n\nHenrietta died before her younger daughter Deborah was old enough to remember her, and Deborah was to spend the rest of her life longing for information about her mother and sister, trying to forge some kind of connection with her lost ones. Deborah's help and commitment to finding the truth was vital in the writing of this book.\n\nSloot comes across as sincere and as having developed a genuine and lasting bond with Henrietta's family, rather than as simply a dispassionate and objective reporter. This was instrumental to her research, as the family had been \"burned\" several times by unscrupulous characters who only wanted to cash in on the story for their own profit. It made the Lacks family defensive and ultra cautious. Before Skloot could even begin writing the book, she first had to win their trust. And she does seem to have honored that, by setting up a scholarship trust fund for the education of Henrietta's descendants and donating a portion of the book's profits to it. Another, indirect, result of this book is the donation of tombstones for Henrietta's and her daughter Elsie's previously unmarked graves.\n\nThe information given in the book about the ways in which Henrietta's cells have contributed to science and helped other people is fascinating and amazing! Without HeLa, the polio vaccine and the most effective cancer medications wouldn't exist; nor could the HIV virus have been identified. And these are just the beginning: the list goes on and on.\n\nThe book concludes with a thorough discussion of the ethics of medical research on human tissues. Henrietta's sons have a strong sense of injustice that their mother's cells were taken without her knowledge or permission, and that so many people have made vast amounts of money off of them while her children cannot afford basic medical care. And who can blame them? They do have a point. Patient privacy is another problem that arises when working with human cells, especially now that their DNA can be fingerprinted. Skloot interviews many experts with widely varying opinions about these issues, and shows us how extremely complex the matter is, with no easy answers.\n\nThe book includes some great photos. And if you go to the author's website, you can see many more photos, including some of the ones described but not included in the book. [...]\n\nMy one criticism of this book was that it left some questions unanswered that probably could have been answered. Especially - and this one's driving me crazy - what were the caged creatures that frightened Margaret Lacks so, when she got lost in the basement of Johns Hopkins Hospital - the \"man-sized rabbits\"? (I'm guessing kangaroos.) Also, why were Henrietta's children allowed to be born with damage from congenital syphilis? Why wasn't Henrietta treated for it? Her first two kids (including Elsie) were born at home, so she probably didn't have access to professional medical care at that time. But the others were born in hospitals. Was it that she didn't have any prenatal care, so that by the time she was in labor it was too late? Or that the effective penicillin treatment wasn't commonly available yet? Was it available but not given to indigent black patients?\n\nI also noticed that Skloots uses the inaccurate term \"hereditary syphilis\" rather than the correct \"congenital syphilis.\" But given the extensive amount of research she did (the book took 10 years to write) I suspect that was a deliberate choice rather than an error. Skloots may have felt that readers without a scientific background would better understand the word \"hereditary\". Actually \"hereditary\" refers to features that are inherited by way of genes; \"congenital\" simply means that a person is born with some condition, and it may or may not be hereditary. Syphilis is not a genetic disease, but one that comes from being infected by the microorganism. In congenital syphilis, the fetus is infected while in the womb and the disease has already caused permanent damage by the time the baby is born.\n\nFurther evidence of the massive research project undertaken by Ms. Skloots can be seen in the appendices. The \"Acknowledgments\" section is actually interesting to read, as it gives further information about members of the Lacks family and their story. And beware when reading the \"Notes\" section - as well as thousands of technical scientific articles, it describes hundreds of interesting-sounding books for further reading that might threaten to overwhelm your tbr list!\n\nOprah Winfrey and Alan Ball are working together on producing a movie based on The Immortal Life on Henrietta Lacks. Thanks to this book, Henrietta and her family are finally getting the recognition they deserve. On the inside back of the book jacket, there is a website address given where you can donate to the foundation for the education of Henrietta's descendants. I hope that everyone who reads the book will do that, even if they can only afford a small contribution. [...]\n\n(358 pages)",
    "The book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is about the life, death, and family life of a woman named Henrietta. When she turned 30 she developed an aggressive form cervical cancer and received treatment at John Hopkins hospital. However as they were treating her the doctor took a slice of her tumor and put it into a tube for testing. They did this with a lot of people back then all without patient consent. The doctor, specifically Gey Gardener, wanted to make an immortal cell line that didn’t die like the rest. Usually a day or two after they took the sample, it died. However Henrietta’s cells lived and continued to grow in as much space and they gave it. Though thought of as a fluke at first, her cells continue to divide to this day and is used in almost every laboratory. Because of their widespread nature, it is amazing how not many people know about the woman behind the cells. This is why the author decided to write this book. While the topic alone is amazing, the author made it even better by making the book easy to understand, exploring the ethics of the doctor patient relationship, and incorporating Henrietta’s family.\nThe easy to understand language is what makes the book available to such a wide audience. Whenever a science term or event was refereed to instead of requiring the reader to have prior knowledge everything was explained. At times it seemed that things were explained in too much detail but this is so that anyone can read it and understand. In book of this sort, usually a lot of terms are thrown around but that is not the case in this one. There were some times that things could have been left out because they involved basic information but she also included it so that people like Henrietta’s descendants, who had little to no formal education, could read it. By no means was this a strictly scientific book, in fact one of its other strong points was the human element.\nThe author is in fact a character in this story. In order to write this story she had to get know the family of Henrietta which was not very easy. At one point she was calling Henrietta’s daughter every day just for the story. She got stood up in hotels, hung up on, and criticized but she stayed on the story. Because of that she got really close to Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Her and Deborah formed a true bond and the author stayed with her even through panic attacks, health issues, bouts of extreme paranoia, and her eventual death. There was a very clear human element that pulled at heartstring that didn’t just stem from the author getting to know the family but from her researching and finding the small things. Some of these times include when Henrietta was dying. Instead of just saying that she died the author went in detail and included a really small but meaningful piece on page 81. “And everyone I talked to who might know said that Gey and Henrietta never met. Everyone, that is, except Laure Aurelian, a microbiologist who was Geys colleague at Hopkins. I’ll never forget it, Aurelian said. George told me he leaned over Henrietta’s bed and said, Your cells will make you immortal. He told Henrietta her cells would help save the lives of countless people, and she smiled. She told him she was glad her pain would come to some good for someone.” (81). That tiny moment said represented was so beautifully tragic and added a whole new level to the book.\nAnother part that was really special about the book was the moral and ethical dilemmas. Henrietta’s cells were taken without her knowledge or permission. “No one had told Henrietta that TeLinde was collecting samples or asked if she wanted to be a donor Wharton picked up a sharp knife and shaved two dime-sized pieces of tissue from Henrietta’s cervix” (39). The author makes a point of acknowledging that back then patients and doctors had a very strained relationship. Doctors would often experiment on their patient without permission. But also doctors weren’t required to tell the patient everything that was going on with them. There was one instant that the author pointed out a case where a man, Moore, had cancer and his doctor Golde, treated him but removed his spleen. But then the doctor started asking for numerous follow up appointments and went as far as paying for his plane ticket from the other side of the country to come see him until Moore figured out something fishy was going on. Moore found out that Golde was engineering a cell line from his cells because they produced a hard to come by protein. When Moore tried to sue he lost because Golde patented it and there was a ruling that once cells leave a patient's body, they are no longer their own. The only difference between this case and Henrietta’s was that the man was educated enough to fight this and even when the ruling was not in his favor he could make sure the doctor couldn’t take any more of his cells. The author also showed another example of the ethics of the medical practice. There was a case where a man went in for what he thought was a standard procedure but when he woke up he was paralysed from the waist down. He had no idea the risks of the procedure which could have influenced his decision of whether to get it or pursue another method of treatment.\nOverall the books way of being empathetic, easy to understand, and tackling the moral and ethical nuances of the medical practice is what made it so good. Through every page I felt immersed in the story and the breakup of the chapters were masterful. I really enjoyed how the book was divided into chapter that jumped back and from when Henrietta’s childhood and when she got her diagnosis to her death and the author trying to find out more about her. It reads like a research novel. While it wasn’t as plot driven as a novel it wasn’t as analytical and clinical as a textbook. It was also more human and less persuasive than a newspaper article. I liked the way the author organised it because it guaranteed that something was always happening which is why the author organized it that way. It made it really interesting and informative. It also brought out themes of lack of health care for colored people in the 50’s, the spiritual belief of the link between body and soul, and the poverty that still exists today. I expected this book to be very clinical focus only on how the cells were used but I was pleasantly surprised. By the end of the book, the author reached the conclusion that Henrietta should be known and that her family should be either cared for or compensated for the distribution of their mother’s cells. The book as a whole goes very logically from start to finish and comes together very sadly but oddly satisfyingly with the death of Deborah and shows that the whole Lacks family had hard lives.",
    "There are several stories which require the storyteller to insert themselves within the story to set the tone and context of their respective stories. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks did not require that at all and yet for some reason a large portion of the book is devoted to showing how fair this white (and how often they remind us that she is white!) woman manages to surpass the absolute bottom of the barrel expectations the much-abused Lacks family has after decades upon decades of being taken advantage of by people who scarcely acknowledged their humanity. At on point the author relays an experience where she had to relay what she knew about how black people have historically been treated in medical situations and she seems to figuratively pat herself on the back for being able to name two situations. She explains how she didn't talk down to people in one breath and then in another breath explains how (in her eyes) uneducated x person is (\"Do you know what a cell is?\").\n\nThe book couldn't have been written without addressing race both in its history and in the underlying impact that segregation and underservice has had on communities. Henrietta Lacks had what happened to her happen because she was black, no doubt about that, but this book spends more time on explaining how the white woman gained the trust of Henrietta's remaining family than it does on the actual life of Henrietta Lacks!\n\nThe writing was nothing particularly special, the chronology of the book jumps around so much they've included a timeline to remind you where you are (though it does so to disguise a few minorly startling events). The book reads like a book report that an overzealous white ninth-grade horsegirl would have to write on Beloved by Toni Morrison: self-congratulatory and constantly reminding people that she's not like the poor black folk just because she's telling you about their story.\n\nI recommend getting this one from the library. Read it for Henrietta's life, which comprises about two or three chapters only(!) and know that nothing gets resolved re: gene/tissue ownership (for anyone) by the end of the book.",
    "As a Life Sciences Graduate, I knew of the HeLa cells and of the woman behind the cells, but only by name. This book is very well researched, very well written and engaging. I have greatly enjoyed reading the story of the Lacks family, of Henrietta Lacks' life her background, her life, her personality, her children etc. This book, perfectly narrated, touches on multiple topics, from segregation to biology. I have learnt far more in the book around the story of cell culture than I did in my undergrad and I wish we had been recommended this book. It places scientific research, informed consent, and patient privacy in its historical context. The author has given life to the woman and her family besides her cells stored in the lab. A fascinating book. I highly recommend this book. I have followed the link directing to the foundation and am very please to read that donations have allowed so much for the lacks family. Finally, the author's passion, attention to details and strong desire to uncover the truth in addition to her genuine intentions and actions to help this family is admirable.",
    "Henrietta Lacks changed medical science yet most scientists don't know her name. The medication we take today is down to the progress medical science made through her immortal life, yet her own family can not afford doctors. I was upset and angry to read the authors note at the beginning, my fury and sadness only rose from there.\n\nThis is a non fiction about Henrietta Lacks, a black women who died of cancer of the cervix in a time where black people didn't question white people, it was the time of Jim Crow laws, segregation and black people were just happy to be getting treatment since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.\n\nThe history of smear tests and HPV are also covered here, it's very readable and the author has done a great job of making these science heavy subjects very digestible.\n\nBut this isn't a history of science, its the history of a woman, a woman we should all know the name of.\n\nAs a side note I am totally baffled that until recently we had to opt into a donor scheme to save a life with our organs yet we have no claim on our tissues and cells for medical research. Mind-blowing.",
    "A fascinating read - thoroughly enjoyed the book. I work in scientific research and clinical trials and the entire 'story' was so interesting to me, I have even worked on HeLa cells - but had no idea of their background, and the way they were obtained and used in the early days without consent horrifies me.\nI have also just watched the film (on a plane journey) and have to say I was very disappointed with it - it in no way does justice to the book - so if you have only watched the movie, don't let it put you off reading the book - the book is SO much better.",
    "This is an amazing book to read but a cripplingly sad saga for the family and descendants of Henrietta Lacks. I shed more than a few tears as I read this account of how an amazing woman of colour bore her 'lot in life' as the saying all too often goes, only to die alone and in acute pain.\n\nWhile this book is mainly about how the cancerous cells of Henrietta Lacks, or Helen Lane as she was first recorded against the 'HeLa' cells that were obtained from the first of the Many tumours that eventually caused her death, gave science some hugely amazing results that jumped mankind through hoops forwards in regard of treatments discovered for many diseases, not least of which is many types of cancer and the polio pandemic of the 1950's, it is also the story of Henrietta's family from birth to the present day - and the future.\n\nI have no wish to detract from the text of this book any further other than to tell you, the prospective reader, that this book is worth the time you will take in reading it and, once you have done so, you will come to regard Henrietta and her family - particularly her daughters Elsie and Deborah with sadness first and then awe.\n\nI cannot emphasise enough how profound a story this is nor how deeply it has affected me given how badly Henrietta and her family were treated. I would implore each and every person to get hold of a copy and read how far science has travelled for decades already and will do so for many more all because of Henrietta.\n\nI own a softback and an e-copy of this book"

    "I got this book at the recommendation of my therapist and boy has it changed my life. I haven’t finished it yet, but there were a few life-changing statements in the introduction alone. It has allowed me to understand that self-compassion is NOT selfish and is actually essential to surviving. It has really opened up my eyes to the MAJOR differences in the compassion I show others vs. the compassion (or lack thereof) that I show myself. I’ll admit that I’m truly devoting a lot of time to this and accepting it completely, which I have found to be the most beneficial. I have found that having a copy of an “emotion wheel” and a list of tones (positive, neutral, and negative) on hand has also been helpful in navigating some of the exercises throughout the book. I have only been working through this book for a short period of time, but it has already had a positive impact in my life.\n*For reference: I’m a 22 y/o female, have anxiety, depression, and avoidant personality disorder, and have been on antidepressants for years (this is my dad’s account excuse the profile pic). This book has been one of the first truly beneficial resources that I have been introduced to. It has not only helped me work on self-compassion, but it has also helped me be more mindful in situations where I’m usually very anxious and start overthinking. I would highly recommend this book.\n\nThe chapters are set up by introducing a topic & providing real world examples that are easy to understand. At the end of the chapter they have exercises where they have you reflect on certain situations (they prompt you) and write down your thoughts. There’s usually a few exercises that end up with you really breaking down how you think/act. They usually address your true inner feelings that you may have been burying or ignoring (hence the emotion wheel), and they bring it back around to exercises that allow you modify the negative behaviors that you’re been reflecting on to wrap up the chapter. I personally think spending a decent amount of time on the exercises is truly beneficial to individual success.\n(Sorry for the novel-length review but I truly think this is an amazing resource.)",
    "each chapter has written exercises that really make you think and journal so I found it good for self-reflection and learning",
    "Do you beat yourself up a lot? Are you harshly self-critical? Then Kristin Neff and Christopher Germer’s new workbook on self-compassion might be the exact book for you. It has certainly been very helpful to me. A few years ago, I read Neff’s book Self-Compassion and also Germer’s book The Mindful Path to Self-Compassion. Both are excellent foundations for understanding why we are self-critical and how self-compassion can help. Neff and Germer’s joint venture in the form of this workbook, The Mindful Self-Compassion Workbook: A Proven Way to Accept Yourself, Build Inner Strength, and Thrive, is based on their Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training programs. I have attended one of these, and this workbook is equally helpful for working on self-critical patterns in yourself and becoming more self-compassionate. Neff and Germer are experts in the field of self-compassion and have done countless MSC trainings together. This workbook reflects all that work. It is very well written with a reader-friendly layout. The chapters are short with clear descriptions of what self-compassion is and what it isn’t, as well as many practical exercises: journaling exercises, meditation/mindfulness exercises, and reflections. The book gives you access to downloadable audio files of some of the exercises.\n\nYou do not have to have attended the trainings or read any of the previous books to get a lot out of the workbook. It stands alone, the exercises are excellent, and while I recognized many of them from the MSC training, it didn’t seem repetitious to do them in this format. Quite the contrary. I find that each time I approach this material, I approach it a little differently. I notice something different. The fact is we’re never done with self-compassion practice. There’s no end-point; there’s just more practice.\n\nI highly recommend this workbook to anyone who wants to become more self-compassionate. Whether you’ve already done a lot of work in this area, or this is your first exposure to the idea of self-compassion, this book will be an excellent guide, a compassionate friend on your journey.",
    "This is one of the two books with the greatest impact on my life. The one thing that I strongly appreciate in this book is the psychological research that it is based on. This is not a self-help book that owes its success in marketing or nonsense claims. This is an honest work that teaches us how to care for ourselves, listen to ourselves, tend to our wants and needs and navigate ourselves to making ourselves content and happy. The other thing that I appreciate in this book is the simple and considerate language it is written that is characterized by genuine kindness and the authors’ will to help people essentially transform their inner world.\nI am determined to use many of the practices every day as I feel that I have a lot to gain by applying them consistently.\nThank you so much for this book.",
    "It's my mistake for not seeing the \"print replica\" warning when I bought this thing. I've bought books direct from this publisher previously and they often come in epub files which are perfect for e readers. However, this book title is currently [Oct 2018] only available in pdf format -- it just doesn't work well on a Kindle or iPad.",
    "This book is a brilliant way of dealing with emotional issues. You can work your way through at your own pace; there is plenty of space to write answers to the exercises; and lots of encouragement and positive guidance to keep you going. I really appreciate the practical and research-based examples, activities and meditations, without too much spirituality. I do like many Buddhist philosophies and don't have a problem with aspects of spirituality, but as an atheist, I don't like religious undertones. This book is a good balance, in my opinion.",
    "Doesn't work well on Kindle version. Would suggest purchasing the book.",
    "I have found Kirsten Neff's work to be extremely healing."

    "Our 1 year old twins were biting each other multiple times a day. We had been relying on watching them closely and frequent time-outs but they were about to go to a home daycare and we were scared they would start biting other toddlers too! Within the week that we got this book and started reading it, the biting issue dropped dramatically. Really impressed. Besides which, they like the book enough that they request it at reading time, so it wasn’t just me reading it bc I wanted the biting to stop, it os a book they enjoy and still want to read 6 months later. Highly recommend! Now, where is the one about meltdowns?!?!",
    "Helpful in reinforcing no biting. The first time I read it to my 3 yr 9 month old great grandson he asked to read it 3 times in a row. We were starting to have biting issues. Now he repeats it to my 15 month old.",
    "This is a book I bought to start reading to our son, who has some specialized needs. He had a dental procedure a few months ago that seems to have set off some of his sensory issues and changed the way things feel in his mouth in ways he's been struggling a little to adapt to. Totally not the fault of his dentist, it's one of those things that can be hard to avoid and difficult to always predict when you have a child with a sensory processing disorder. Anyways, we had a couple of books from this series that we used with our daughter when she was little, though not this one, so I was familiar enough with the series to have a general idea of what I was getting.\n\nI really like how this book opens by talking about how strong and sharp teeth are, mentions the approved of use, and then goes right into biting hurts. I like that the expression on the injured child's face is clear enough that my son can interpret her as both crying and clearly in distress. He has Autism as well, so sometimes it can be pretty hard for him to pick up on those types of cues unless they are very dramatic or emphasized. Because our son is 5, some of the sections of the book don't apply to him as much, because it spends a couple of pages talking about how many teeth a child will have when they grow in and that biting isn't an appropriate response to teething pain. I kind of adlibbed in this section and added how dental work can also cause discomfort that can make you want to bite. And you totally can't bite the dentist ;)\n\nI really like that this book gives strategies for replacing chewing, most of which are things he's willing to do -except rest... we don't really do resting in this house ;) I like that this book then goes on to explain how emotional things can cause a person to want to bite, because sometimes for him, he gets overloaded and tries to bite because the compression on those joints helps to calm him down, and then emphasizes that we don't bite for those reasons because it hurts others. I am a super big fan of the fact that this book drums in the \"why\" over and over again, because for our little man, he may understand what you want him to do, but unless you can get him to understand the \"why,\" he's less likely to cooperate with you. This section is again followed by some strategies that he can again use, although for him it's via his speech computer when it comes to that whole \"use your words\" thing.\n\nThen the book talks about how it feels like if someone bites you and goes on to coach that we do not bite back even if we are bitten, we get help from a grown up, and then ends on a final reminder about teeth not being for biting and a final positive use (smiling). I feel like even though this book has a few areas that aren't as applicable to us at this time (teeth coming in), they may be as he gets old enough to loose teeth in the next couple of years. I like how thorough and repetitive this book is, and think it's a great social story resource for a kiddo who may be going through a biting phase. I don't anticipate that this alone will entirely solve our problem, it's part of a more comprehensive approach that involves the Wilbarger oral protocol, subbing in vibrating teethers when he leans in to try and bite me, and redirecting him frequently to appropriate chewers. I'm also trying to teach him how to chew gum, but that's going to be a longer process because currently, he doesn't want to touch that. But I think this will be a helpful support to us, he's already been looking at it as I read it to him, and I believe it could be a helpful support for your kiddo as well.",
    "while my son enjoyed this book, he liked Dino books better. The illustrations are cute but might be less eye grabbing than a book with animals etc. It was a really easy read, nice and clear, and gets the message across that teeth aren't made for biting",
    "Daycare reported two biting events in less than two weeks for our 20 month old daughter, and we weren’t sure what to do. The center director suggested getting a book to curb her biting other kids. For the last month, she has not bitten anyone else and understands as we read it, that biting is bad. Very highly recommend this book as it works remarkably quick. The one suggestion I would make is you need to do this every day to reinforce it. We made it part of her bedtime routine and she actually likes the book!",
    "I got this for my 19 months old daughter. She goes to daycare and had been having severe biting issues. She gets an incident almost everyday and at her worst she gets 3 incident a day. She does not bite us at home. She only does it at daycare when someone takes her toy away, she wants something that another child is playing with or another child sits closer to her and she doesn't want it. We dread picking her up because we feel like we're doing the walk of shame when we have to sign her incident report.\n\nI got this book because this seems to be the highest rating book that addresses biting and it seems to worked for a lot of people who posted a review. My daughter loves this book and I read it to her every night before bed and in the morning when she wakes up. This is one of her must read nightly book. Unfortunately, this did not work for her at all. She understood it hurt when she bites based on the photos in this book but she still bites even after a month of reading this to her. Eventually, daycare suggested to see a therapist for both occupational and speech therapy and we did. So we meet with the therapist and she said my daughter does not need any therapy at all. So the therapist went to my child's daycare to observe her and gave the teacher pointers on how to deal with my daughters biting issues. What worked for my daughter was diversion, watching her closely and offering her something else before she gets mad. A week after that her incident starts to lessen and now 2 months after we're completely incident free.\n\nI know some parts of my review are irrelevant to this book but I just want to share my experience hoping it'll help others too. As a mom of a serial biter, I don't want to relive that experience again. As for this book, this is still my daughter's favorite book and she won't go to bed without reading this. So yeah it's a great book.",
    "My son is biracial and it was wonderful to see a child of color on the cover and throughout this book. The message made sense to him as a 12 month old, and now at 20 months. It effectively curbed his biting and I was getting huge bruises every time he was teething. Thank you!",
    "This is a good book overall, but it’s not for everyone. A lot of kids who deal with biting are using as communication, often because they’re non verbal. Unfortunately I had to figure out how to change some of the wording, as it doesn’t apply to my child. Would have been a much better book if it was more inclusive.",
    "Bought this for my 3 yr old son while he was transitioning from being the only child to a big brother. At first I thought there was no hope as he would constantly throw tanturms and would try to bite the baby. Then I purchased this book and safe to say things have calmed down. Its part of our bedtime routine that I will this book with him and remind him of what teeth are actually meant for. I would highly recommend this book to all the parents who're going through the same situation of sibling jealousy or any other type of behaviour issues and how this book can help towards calming and behaving toddlers.",
    "Got this book after a couple of incidents of my 3 year old son biting other children. I feel that it is too simplistic- there isn’t a story to follow and the book is very short with a patronising 2 page spread at the back with “tips”. However my son loves the book and asks to read it regularly and we haven’t had any problems with biting since we got it a couple of months ago so it must be doing something right!",
    "I was having problems with my son biting for quite regularly for some time at nursery and at home, he was still quite young at 20 months old and my health visitor recommended giving a book a try, I bought this one and when it arrived I thought maybe the wording of the book was for children who were a bit older than my son but I read it to him every day for a week (along with others book aswell so as not too be forcing this on him) but 4 months down the line and he has not bitten anyone again since so it certainly must of had an effect on him",
    "Love this book! It ends with a great line, that we keep using to reaffirm the book. But after reading this everyday, and at first a few times a day the incidents have massively dropped. My son is 18 months old and was biting several times a day, with a bite form from nursery every day. After 2 days we saw a difference in him. Since then we have had one bite, a few where he has stopped himself and smiled like the book says. Really pleased with his progress, after having been he book just over a week.",
    "My granddaughter is not quite two, and had got into the habit, when angry, of biting her mum and leaving large bruises. She loved this book on sight and when my daughter reads it to her she really reacts to it immediately. She now just pats my daughter and says \"Aah\". Very impressed with this."

    "All the books are in perfect condition. I didn't take a photo before opening it, but it arrived still sealed up in plastic. Slip cover is ripped on the bottom but that's only because the entire set is so heavy. I don't mind a little clear packing tape to keep it in shape!",
    "My shipment from superbookdeals arrived early and in perfect condition. Great price! I remember borrowing these from friends one book at a time in the early 2000s (owned a single volume myself) and I am so excited to have my own copies!!",
    "Like many others, my Sandman series arrived damaged. Part of the top was ripped/torn from front to back. I'm keeping it because I've wanted this series for a long time, the item that arrived is overpriced for what it is IMO. I was expecting something with much better quality.",
    "After reading the many reviews of people who received this item only to find it was damaged in some way, I was a bit nervous about ordering it. However, my copy of the complete Sandman boxed set arrived today (on time!) and I am very happy to say that it is in pristine condition. No damage at all, shrink wrap in tact and none of the corners even slightly bent or anything. Due to the negative feedback of others, I was expecting the box to be flimsy cardboard, but it is actually quite sturdy. It seems well made. Perhaps it was just because I set my expectations low, but I am EXTREMELY satisfied overall with my purchase and I know the content is worthy of 5 stars (or better!) as well!",
    "Update 10/09/2020:\nReplacement copy arrived undamaged. Packaging was still the same (one bag of air), but looks like it was handled with better care than the first. I'd like to note that this was shipped alone, so if you've ordered this with other items, your packaging may differ.\nThe individual novels appear fine and undamaged too, so I've adjusted my rating accordingly.\nIn either case, I'm still happy to have this in my collection.\nOriginal Review:\nI'm happy to finally have this collection, but come on. Who packaged this? It was loose in the box, there was one air packet, and it was retaped. So it was very disappointing to open it and see the bottom of the slipcase was cracked and broken.",
    "Sandman is the graphic novel that brought graphic novels into the world of \"respectable\" literature. It is a monumental work, not only with regard to its sheer size but also the amazing creative force, the historical vignettes, the references to classical literature, the beauty of the script, the stunning artwork, the psychological and philosophical forays, all in a lovely and durable package. Sandman is horror; it is fantasy; it is achingly beautiful, deeply tragic, intellectually challenging, and absolutely unforgettable.",
    "I love the timely delivery and how the box set is put together. What I would caution you about; this is a RENTAL and not a purchase! Be careful! Amazon does not make it easy to actually pay the difference because they make more from you renting the product. The actual cost is twice as much as advertised. I love this series and intend to pay the difference but I wish I had known before ordering.",
    "This was a present to myself. As others have said, the outer case does take a bit of damage from shipping, they really should use more packing material in the box. But mine came with very very slight damage to the case and the volumes themselves are perfect so it wasn’t a big deal for me. All in all, a good price for a set of this magnitude and quality.",
    "The box set arrived in a large box so I doubt it was damaged in transport, however as you can see on the attached photos, the case was damaged. I believe they're sending out previously returned damaged items or are flat out not handling them properly in storage. The damage to the case simply makes it look bad on your bookshelf.\n\nAside from the cover, the comics themselves have wrinkly pages, which appear to be poorly glued together, so poorly that it feels like it might fall apart while reading it. In addition to that, some of the pages are poorly printed and discoloration/smudges as seen on the attached photos.",
    "My boyfriend bought this box set for me a couple of years ago. I had come to Sandman very late - partly because when it first started out, I would have been way too young to read it. Now that I have discovered it, the box set seemed to be the most economical way of getting all issues. It is a mammoth of a box set - you definitely need a lot of space on your bookshelf to accommodate it. The quality of the paperbacks are great; the colours are fantastic, and they feel as though they should last a while. Having the slipcase means that there is that extra protection for them.",
    "Books are great, and old favourites. Slip case is flimsy, and the packaging it was sent in pathetically inadequate - flimsy card board box and a few sheets of scrunched up brown paper is in no way adequate for an item this heavy.",
    "Don’t expect a luxurious box (as some in the comments seem to have expected). It’s just a cardboard box making it handy to keep the many softcover volumes together.\nThe important part is the contents of this seminal work.\nI’m really enjoying it :)",
    "Ich bin riesengroßer Neil Gaiman Fan - die Collection war ein Gebrutstagsgeschenk an mich selbst, wie ein Kind habe ich mich gefreut. Mein Problem ist hier der Verkauf an sich: der Schieber selbst war leider angerissen, als ich das Paket aufmachte (s. Fotos). Amazon selbst gibt keinen Preisnachlass oder schickt Ersatzprodukt; ich kann es nur zurückschicken. Ich durfte Amazon hier bisher deutlich kundenfreundlicher erleben und weiß für mich, in Zukunft nicht mehr über den Global Store zu bestellen."

    "There are few, if any, current politicians that have the rhetorical or intellectual skills of many of our founders. Fewer still understand the principles that promote the general welfare (not a selection of special interest groups) and made America exceptional. This book provides a wonderful crash course on the main functions our Constitution was designed to address. Buy a bunch, give them to people who will read them and memorize some of the pithy quotes and use them frequently.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the paperback. The author researched verbatim items from several Revolutionary War figures and a few others, e.g., Lincoln and more. He groups the quotations around a theme for each chapter. Each quotation is noted as to the source.\n\nThis should make every reader both proud of our nation's founders and what they would say today in 2022.",
    "I am a great fan of history, our exceptional Nation, its Founders, and our way of life here...so this book seemed a good choice to refresh my memory about what we were and still should be all about. I was not disappointed in the least! The book is written as a speech to the nation, composed of the actual words spoken or written by many of the Founding Fathers and a few others. Incredible and inspiring! Some may say they weren't thinking of the future when they were writing over 200 years ago, but I have to say, their thoughts and ideas are just as relevant today as they were back then. Time has not dimmed their foresight. This book will move those that are thrilled with the history of our great nation, and give courage to stand against the tide wishing to drown our incredible history with undue criticism and scandal. This book will renew your love of how our country came to be, the benefits we derived from these great men and their lofty ideals, the promise of a new nation conceived in liberty. I highly recommend this book.",

How they moved through ideas, principles, debates, and compromises to determine the type and structure of that government. How to make it become a government \"of the people, by the people, and for the people\". A government with checks and balances to control the government; not a government to control the people. It speaks to the present from the past.",

    "Of course I loved the book. It's so much more than \"young-adult combing-of-age\". For me, it was deeply moving, an often gripping story, particularly at the end, and it opened a window not just into teenagers, but into life at all stages -- this while being extremely well-written and without calling attention to its well-written-ness. What I found most striking, was showing life through a different kind of mind, what's sometimes called Asperger's Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism. AS/HFA isn't a disease, but an important difference, important to us all. What makes AS/HFA an important difference is its talents, particularly its special \"perceptiveness\", though not \"perceptiveness\" in the usual sense. More as a deep meaning to what Robert Burns wrote, \"And would some power, the Gods give us, To see ourselves as others see us!\"\n\n(Know this book deals directly with many painful topics including abuse, suicide and violent bullying. It's not for \"more sensitive\" readers.)\n\nReading several reviews, I'm not surprised that some reviewers found the lead character, Charlie, \"too sweet\" and \"improbable\". In this, understandably, they miss Charlie's \"diffferent\" mind and more, his \"different\" way of being. I'm a psychotherapist, specializing for several decades in people for whom therapy has failed, often people, like Charlie, who've been hospitalized. And a dozen years ago, I discovered that maybe a quarter of my clients were in the autism spectrum, almost always AS/HFA -- often highly intelligent and able to relate to the neurotypically-structured social world, though relating \"differently\" and needing much more conscious struggling with the basics. After working several years with AS/HFA, I found these people had remarkable powers, and the usual \"unable to relate or care\" descritpion of autism just wasn't true in the ordinary sense. Most were neither uninterested nor uncaring -- in fact, quite the opposite. They desperately wanted to relate and, in some ways, they were over-caring, extremely sensitive to others. They related differently, not only to others, but to themselves and their world and, in particular, to language. Often not badly, but just very differently.\n\nWriting in first person gives the author no place to hide. You MUST have an extremely interesting character, and you MUST know that character with ruthless clarity. Chbosky does, and he does so well that I suspect he may have a touch of autism himself. Or at least it runs in his family. Disclosure: after several years working with AS/HFA children, teens and adults, I noticed that I was unusually drawn to them; I could almost use that diagnostically. With that awareness, I figured out that autism runs in my family. And with that, the disease faded away and the differences began to shine through. Let me note a few points from \"The Perks\" to illustrate. Charlie's speech, thinking and relating, at first blush, seems to be almost child-like, more charcteristic of six years old than sixteen. He has an astonishing honesty, a naive not-understanding, and his use of words frequently has that unintended poetic feel of children. But look more carefully: Yes, there are situations he doesn't get in ways shocking for a middle-teen. But as he thinks about them and questions them, he often goes right to the heart-of-the-matter, and a heart-of-the-matter that's usually missed or forgotten by those of us, especially adults, who \"just get it\" and go on. Let me give an extended quote from the book's end:\n\n\"Later, [my friends, Sam and Patrick,] came by in Sam's pickup truck. And we went to the Big Boy just like we always did. Sam told us about her life at school, which sounded very exciting. And I told her about my life in the hospital, which didn't. And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest. After we left, we got in Sam's pickup truck, and just like Sam promised, we drove to the tunnel. About half a mile from the tunnel, Sam stopped the car, and I climbed in back. Patrick played the radio really loud so I could hear it, and as we were approaching the tunnel, I listened to the music and thought about all the things that people have said to me over the past year. I thought about Bill telling me I was special. And my sister saying she loved me. And my mom, too. And even my dad and brother when I was in the hospital. I thought about Patrick calling me his friend. And I thought about Sam telling me to do things. To really be there. And I just thought how great it was to have friends and a family....\"\n\n\"But mostly, I was crying because I was suddenly very aware of the fact that it was me standing up in that tunnel with the wind over my face. Not caring if I saw downtown. Not even thinking about it. Because I was standing in the tunnel. And I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite.\"\n\nStarting out, it seems almost primitively black-&-white, until \"And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest.\" In the context of all that literal-ness, it's startling. Charlie doesn't just note that \"Patrick is telling jokes\". Humor is often a struggle for AS/HFA, and so they need to work at understanding it. Through his work, Charlie is seeing not only Patrick's style of humor, but its function. Since AS/HFA often doesn't instinctively grasp \"what\" to do, they approach others and their world more basically through \"why it's done\" and \"what it means\". Because Charlie struggles to see the function of so much, he remains very much in touch with a stripped-down sense of that function's truth. Again, \"And Patrick made jokes to keep everyone honest.\"\n\nThen Charlie's \"telling\" returns to seemingly smple description. But read again: the description is less \"simple\" than \"primary\". And in many ways, this is the importance for us in AS/HFA relating. Attention to detail, of what simply \"is\", is consciously, clearly combined with an almost-primary way of relating to themselves, to others, to their world, as well as a primary relating to language. And when we see ourselves, our world, our lives through Charlie's AS/HFA \"primary\" lens, we not only see afresh. We see what is \"primary\", what goes to the heart-of-the-matter, what is the stripped down function, and so what is truly important. Not preachy, but very experiential -- \"truly important\" very much as-lived.\n\nAnd Charlie winds up poetically pointing to primary experiences, connections and always-available potentials within and around us all: \"And that was enough to make me feel infinite\". And he got there through self and love and family and friends. Frankly, as a therapist who works most-of-all with severe trauma -- war PTSD, attachment disorders, sexual abuse, and deep grievings -- that's a short list, in those two paragraphs, of what gets lost in trauma and of what it takes to heal.\n\nOK, I'm probably probing more than interests most potential readers. As you can see in other reviews, there are many levels to enjoy in this book. If you like, though, let yourself be touched by Charlie's \"primary\" description-plus-function. You may find it not only intriguging and moving, but healing. And who of us can't use a touch of healing now-and-then?\n\nP.S. I read this on Kindle and, even on my laptop, I found it an easy read. It was particularly helpful because, now over 60 years old, I can boost up the print size, making reading more relaxing.",
    "I absolutely love this book and movie. It perfectly summarizes being a teenager and surviving high school. Everyone has their demons they struggle with. It helps to identify with each of them. What a great read.",
    "I love this book and the movie is great as well. Would buy 100 copies and give them out for free if I had the money!",
    "Dear Friend,\n\nI literally just finished reading this book, and felt compelled to write a review. Not because I'm some sort of intellectual who just loves to hear myself and show people how smart I am, or how well (or not well) I write. I am not even attempting to persuade anyone to purchase this book. I am writing this because I feel inspired. Mainly I feel inspired because at times I feel that the central character and I share many of the same attributes. Mainly the ability to watch and absorb, but not actively participate. Like Charlie, I am participating by writing this review because believe it or not, something as small as writing a simple review on Amazon can make a \"wallflower\" feel like a participant and not just a quiet observer. This is something I have taken from this book. This is not so much me explaining my inner battle, not like being a compulsive liar, or a maniac depressive or something that can actually be considered a battle from within that can have life changing results. Simply, this is a characteristic that I am aware of that I would like to change to a certain extent \"because it's okay to feel things. And be who we are about them\", and expressing oneself is the best way to feel things, even in the smallest ways.\n\nKurt Vonnegut once said \"to practice any art, no matter how well or badly is a way to make your soul grow\". I have never written a review, the last time Ive done anything similar to this was probably a million years ago when I had to do my last book report ever. Bare with me, I'm sure my thoughts and opinions will become a jumbled up mess at some point. But I must remind myself that this is NOT about perfection. So here goes nothing...........\n\n\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is a story of a young man named \"Charlie\", he makes it known he rather be anonymous to his audience so throughout the book he uses this particular fake name for his anonymity reasons. His audience is a person he has never actually meet, but knows through other people and feels comfortable enough to write letters to (you get the feeling very quickly that Charlie does not have many outlets for his feelings, so anything seems acceptable and helpful). These letters contain his days, his thought, his opinions, and mainly his raw feelings. Charlie is pleasant boy with a gentle presence and a sensitive soul. He is a bit odd in his feelings and has some troubles, troubles that throughout the book are a bit hard to pin point. You soon learn that he has lost two very important people in his life and figure that he has had a really hard time dealing with these losses. He is a lonely young man getting ready to start his freshman year of high school. He loves his family but has a disconnect from them mainly because of his quiet nature and sensitivity, which no one understands, but his mother is the most patient with him. He doesn't have many friends and would be considered a loner until Sam and Patrick come along. With them comes a light that is shone into charlies gloomy world that gives him a new found hope and happiness. He feels less alone now that he has found two people who have genuinely taken an interest in him. Sam and Patrick are older, but when getting to know Charlie while reading this book you start to see that him being friends with older people is actually better for Charlie, as opposed to being friends with kids his own age. Because of Charlies over-sensitivity I believe it could've only been tolerated by people with a certain amount of maturity. They see Charlie as not just a sweet kid, but a person with a lot to contribute; whether he believes this quality about himself or not. Sam and Patrick are both very interesting people, both seniors and consider themselves to be very cultured and individualistic. Charlie takes notice of this and gravitates towards them and there circle of friends very quickly because they are so interesting, fun, honest, and forgiving.\n\nThroughout this book through the letters Charlie sends his anonymous reader, you feel Charlies love for everyone in his life including his siblings, parents, his teacher who takes a special interest in Charlie, his deceased aunt, and mostly his friends Sam and Patrick. Through the book you feel Charlies highs and his lows, but you also feel the dark cloud that seems to never be too far from Charlie. This sadness and guilt haunts Charlie regularly and just when it seems his has shaken it, it appears over his head gloomier and sadder than ever. You come to love Charlie very quickly when reading this book, he reminds us what it meant to be a timid teenager with a vulnerability and sensitivity that at times is indescribable. You also see how fiercely loyal Charlie is. When the tables turn and his friends start having hard times, Charlies love and devotion to his friends never changes, even when they \"turn\" on him, it never changes. Through his experiences you become invested in Charlie because there is a longing that you hope he gets better, with a mixer of wanting to protect him from the harshness of the world. When the book nears the end there are some revelations that are like a light switch coming on in a scarily dark room. The pieces that were missing from the puzzle are found, and with comes a maturity and acceptance that Charlie did not poses during the beginning of the book.\n\nOf course I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a book that is beautifully simplistic. But I mainly recommend this book to anyone who is or once was a wallflower. I recommend this book to the sensitive souls that drift around in the cruel and hard world. I recommend this book to anyone who rather take a hug than throw a punch. I recommend this book to the high schooler feeling lost and alone. I recommend this book to anyone who loved the 90's as much as I did!!!! I also recommend reading this book with \"The Smiths\" music on repeat.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read. Hopefully my reviews will get better as time goes on. Cheers!\n\nTeresa",
    "It's not always easy being a teenager. I get that. It's also not easy being a reader who's left thinking \"So what was all the fuss about?\" when they finish a book that felt much too long, said too little, and left me with a general sense that there were too many unanswered questions but they weren't questions I could really be bothered to try to figure out.\n\nEpistolary novels are not unusual; it's a well worn trope for a soul-revealing look at life. But WHO is Charlie supposed to be writing to? I was waiting for a big reveal, expecting a 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' type shocker where we'd find out that there either was no 'friend' or that the friend was his dead aunt, a past abuser, his psychiatrist or just anybody who actually had a part in the book. He refers to a psychologist but never clarifies WHY he sees one, hints at anger management issues and then turns into an avenging ninja when his friend is attacked. It's all just a bit of a mess. Throw in just about everything that could happen to a group of teens - drugs, alcohol, pregnancy, suicide......... - it's like the author had a check-list of big issues to shoe-horn into the story. Where was anorexia and bulimia? I think I missed those but the rest of the angst-bag was emptied out and thrown around.\n\nIt's not all bad. I enjoyed the friendship between Charlie, Sam and Patrick but even that had its dysfunctional elements. I enjoyed being reminded of the joy of the mixed tape - what DO teens do these days? Swap 'play lists'? I enjoyed some of the Rocky Horror Show reminders - but there was TOO much. And I liked the perspective of the child-like innocent observing and reporting.\n\nI can see that arty teens will LOVE this book - just as generations before them loved 'Catcher in the Rye' but from what I recall, not that much actually happened in that either. Reviewers suggest the film may make more sense than the book. I'm really not sure that I can be bothered.",
    "“We accept the love we think we deserve.”\n\nI’ve seen nothing but good things about this book but never given it a try. The internet is full of quotes from the story and I think you’d be hard pushed to find someone who’s never at least heard of the title (this book has more than 1 million ratings on Goodreads and the film was well reviewed too).\n\nCharlie is a socially awkward freshman, writing letters to an unnamed friend. He tells his friend absolutely everything, from his homework assignments to his first erection and so much more.\n\nImage result for the perks of being a wallflower\nSource: Tumblr\nThis is a short book, but it is packed with some difficult and heavy subjects including suicide, domestic abuse, drug use, rape and abortion.\n\nI didn’t enjoy this book as much as I had wanted to, and I found the writing style and structure to be somewhat tiring. Charlie writes with innocence and the author has chosen his sentence structure and grammar to represent this. I understand the technique and have really enjoyed other books like this in the past, but on top of those tricky subjects, this didn’t make for an easy or enjoyable read.\n\n“I don’t think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car.\"\n\nAnother point I’m somewhat frightened to admit to you all is that I didn’t feel sad and I wasn’t really affected by this book in any way. Am I too cold-hearted? Probably! 🙈\n\nI felt the story was a little too melodramatic for my tastes, but I certainly understand why people love it. I also give it huge credit for addressing these topics, especially those so increasingly faced by teenagers today. I think that if I had read this when I was younger, I’d probably have enjoyed it a lot more but at this point in my life, it wasn’t for me.\n\nOverall rating: Contrary to popular opinion, I didn’t love “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and the writing style was most responsible for this. I didn’t hate it, but I just didn’t feel it was for me – 2 stars.",
    "O livro chegou em perfeito estado, muito bem embalado e super rápido. Não tenho muito oq falar sobre a história em si, já que esse é um dos meus livros favoritos e eu estava apenas querendo a versão em inglês, só posso dizer que o inglês dele não é tão difícil de entender para um iniciante(?).",
    "Read April 2019.\n\nI struggled to get excited about this book. We know Charlie is a wallflower and was traumatised earlier in his life by what happened with Aunt Helen, and that he is coming of age in the early 1990's. Yet despite all this it didn't quite add up for me.\n\nWe spend a year with Charlie and all these events happen to him, yet not until the very end did he try and alter his behaviour or try and steer in a slightly different direction. It just seemed to be more of the same. I know when I was young and impressionable and wanted to please people I tried to act differently to fit in. Where as Charlie was very emotional, not afraid who saw him being emotional, and constant in his thoughts and actions.\n\nI think I tired of the letter style too, as it became repetitive after a while. I hoped the recipient would be revealed at some point but frustratingly it never was. Here's my theories:\n\nSurely nobody writes this many letters! I'd say Charlie was closest to Sam (love interest), then Patrick (friend), then Bill (teacher friend) - all above his family. He never referred to talking about these letters with any of his friends or family. So I was thinking maybe he was writing them to himself, but he did post them, and I'm sure he would have mentioned his family becoming suspicious at the amount of letters. There is chance he was using an alias so it wasn't Charlie at all, just another member of the group of friends? But that still doesn't answer who the recipient was. Whoever it was I also feel they would have made some effort to contact Charlie, or contact the polic e to block his mail, but neither happened!\n\nI appreciate this book is aimed at young adult, and as a 40 something not aimed at me. But I hasten to add, I'm a massive, massive fan of Catcher in the Rye which is a similar style and age group, yet far superior in my opinion. I found 'Catcher' more genuine, witty and in a better writing style and format.",
    "Absolutely loved this book, it's one that stays with you. Kudos for having a male protagonist struggling with MH issues as well, as this genre is heavily female-focussed and it's good to remember that both genders can suffer from this equally.\n\nSPOILER/TW BELOW\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe book is considerably more explicit than the more well known film adaptation. There are explicit scenes of rape and it deals heavily with the consequences of childhood sexual abuse. It doesn't take away from the impact of the book, but I was a little blindsided as I hadn't realised that it would be different from the movie. I would exercise caution giving this to a younger reader, as it appears suitable for teens but some of this content might not be appropriate depending on the person."

    "This book gave me everything I was looking for and more. I recently have gotten into mycology and have gone down the rabbit hole of information and gathering what I need. I ordered this book and it arrived after I was at least 20 hours deep into YouTube videos and still managed to learn something new within the first 5 minutes of opening it.\n\nIt being called a bible is not wrong; this thing has been by my bedside since I got it lol. The writers are both knowledgeable, funny, and write like a humans. I often found myself laughing and snickering reading this and smiled more than the last novel I read. I fully expected it to be a moderately sized book with mostly text and some example pictures here and there. But NOPE! This thing is jam packed with more pictures than a coloring book and every picture is quality and explanatory. I am a visual learner and found everything easy to follow along. Every small step is documented and given to us like Prometheus giving us fire and unlocking and freely flowing knowledge. As much information as the internet has and can find mycology information in blogs, that requires research and time to find what you are looking for. This guide book combines everything I would ever want to know at this stage into one easy to read in a pleasure to look at package.\n\nSpiral bound: Wow what a feature that I did not know I needed. Having the spiral bound binding has come with its advantages, notably it being able to lay flat on the page I need and take up less space on my desk or while sitting on a bus/subway. Since this is not structured like an A-Z book and more like an instruction manual to jump around, it makes going to your desired section a breeze and not having to find a makeshift paperweight to keep the book open to go hands-free is *chefs kiss*. Some of the information I feel like I know already and do not need to review or a route of spawning I am not doing at this stage but may not the line I can easily skip over for now and jump around, which is what I believe the authors intended.\n\nWith great knowledge and everything packed into this book, comes my ONLY even remotely negative thing would be it is a thick and a little hefty book which makes carrying around traveling not as convenient. The form factor more than makes up for this as it is not too large nor to small to keep in a small bag. This by far does not take anything anyway from the experience, since I know that's not the intended way to use it and I need to do more bicep curls and shoulder presses. Don't come @ me :)\n\nI highly recommend this bible and guide on mycology and can't rave about it enough!",
    "I absolutely LOVE this book! It is definitely a \"Bible\" and is full of information about different teks, equipment needed, and answers to frequently-asked questions. I am a first timer and had no clue where to start. Thanks to this book, I was able to find exactly which items I needed, how to prepare them, how to inoculate, an approximate time-frame of what I should see and when, how to pick, and how to preserve my harvests. I'm currently in the mycelium growing stage and have been very successful so far! If you would like an excellent reference/how-to book for growing mushrooms, you should get this one to add to your collection.",
    "A lot of good information for beginners and advanced growers",
    "The second book in my mycology library This book has been very valuable with my studies in mycology",
    "Get u started growing the next big thing",
    "(Note: I opted for the spiral bound version & quite happy I did! The book lays flat, easier to make margin notes, highlight, or tab out the pages.)\n\nSuch a deep subject & these authors wrote in such a way so as to not intimidate us “noobs.” This truly IS a, “bible,” for all facets of mushroom growing, as well as medicinal applications in our lives. WELL worth the price & I haven’t even finished the entire book!",
    "I found this book to contain a lot of useful and informative information. I think it is thoughtfully written with helpful information and instructions accompanied by step by step color photographs in nearly every chapter. Overall a very good read.",
    "Definitely a great buy! This is definitely the Mushroom Bible",
    "I originally bought \"growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms\" by Paul Stamets as my \"mushroom bible\" for growing normal, (not magic) edible mushrooms but found that it was very dated both in information and writing style and the pictures were all in black and white which was not good for identification.\n\nI was recommended this book by the chap who owns the UK based Gourmet Woodland Mushrooms site who apparently isn't shy talking about/advising on his use of magic mushrooms (despite me not wanting to hear it...). He said that this was a great book of reference for all mushrooms because a lot of the information was non-specific to magics and could be applied to the normal, edible mushrooms that I was interested in.\n\nI have to say, he was right! It's a great reference book for any mushrooms. It shows things like the life cycles of mycelium and techniques which can be applied in any situation. All the pictures and diagrams are excellent qulity and all in colour. A lot of the information about magic mushrooms will be wasted on me but it's worth it for the non-specific stuff alone that has helped me with ideas about improving my yields on things like lions mane, shitake, hen of the woods etc.\n\nReally happy. Only gripe is that it looks like nobody proof read the book - at all :') there's a few spelling and grammar blunders.",
    "If you're looking to get into this hobby this book Is perfect. Ive read this front to back, back to front and ALWAYS refer to this if I'm unsure.\n\nWhy I like this book:\n-Bright clean up to date photos, this one alone is a winner, it's great to read something but I find it a lot easier to follow with pictures that clearly show how in simple steps how something should be performed and how it should look and sometimes unfortunately shouldn't look if you get it wrong which is all to easy if you don't follow the correct procedures.\n-Well written and humorous, ignore the negative reviews, they don't know what they're talking about.\n\nCan't wait for the next book.\nMush love!",
    "Yes it might be good to know to have a sterile and clean environment but it doesn't have to cost all that much. The internet is full of good info. The processes mentioned in the book put me off to grow them. You get smaller growing kits to start and don't cost you a fortune. Keep the costs low and get yourself some growing kit that cost you under a £50 , heating mat etc. The info is all given by suppliers. Ask them how to grow mushroom Not about growing psilocybin it's illegal in uk so U won't get an answer. Be smart. Don't waste your money on getting all the stuff mentioned in this book. Apparently info is all over the place. Keep it simple cheap and cheerful. Good luck!",
    "This is an awesome reference for beginners and takes you into intermediate level for better results once you feel more confident. The steps with photos make it so much easier to follow. Good humour makes it a fun read so it’s not all serious, scientific text and the science lingo is at a minimum. You couldn’t ask for more starting out and quickly feel confident following it.",
    "Sicher ist Dr. Alraune (Mandrake) ein Pseudonym, was durch die spezielle Materie erklärlich ist. Nein, dieses Buch ist weder eine Pilz-Bibel noch ein definitiver Führer zur Pilzzucht psychoaktiver Arten Es ist \"nur\" ein sehr ausführliches Handbuch zur Zucht der bekanntesten und am leichtesten kultivierbarer Art,Psilocybe cubensis. Es ist eine Vertiefung des Buches von 1976 von Oss und Oeric und auffällig ähnlich mit Beschreibungen und Bildern gemacht. Sicher noch ausführlicher als der Klassiker. Aber schon 1977 kam das Buch von S.H.Pollock \" Magic mushroom cultivation \"heraus, das aber durch den frühen Tod des Autors heute sehr selten ist. Hier werden schon weitere Arten beschrieben, so auch in den bekannten Büchern von Stamets,der auch das Pollockverfahren der Zucht von Dauerformen (Sklerotien),die heute in Holland eine Rolle spielen, beschreibt. Leider machen sich englisch sprechende Autoren nie die Mühe, auch durch fehlende Sprachkenntnisse, deutsche Arbeiten zu erschließen und sind da schlicht unwissend. So kam schon vor 20 Jahren(!) das Pilzzuchtbuch von B.M.Schuldes und S.Lanceata heraus, das bei P.cubensis auch hier nicht benannte, sehr vorteilhafte Substrate wie Holzkompost erschließt und weitere,14 (!) aktive Pilzarten kultiviert. Im ebenfalls schon 20 Jahre alten Buch \"Alles über Psilos\" von A.Adelaars wird die sehr leichte Kultivierung der aktiven Myzelien von 13 Arten als Flüssigkultur beschrieben. Das sind definitive Führer zur Pilzkultur, auch wenn dort eine farbige Darstellung der Arbeitsschritte nicht möglich war.\nAlso, es wird die detaillierteste Kultivierung der Psilocybe cubensis für die Heimzucht dargestellt, aber nicht mehr."

    "Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann\nNew York: Doubleday\n$28.95 - 339 pages\n\n“The whites have bunched us up down here in the backwoods,\nthe roughest part of the United States, thinking ‘we will drive these\nIndians down to where there is a big pile of rock and put them there\nin that corner.’” Now that pile of rock has turned out to be worth millions\nof dollars; now everybody wants to get in here and get some of the money.”\n--Osage Chief Bacon Rind.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of David Grann’s Killers of the Flower Moon is the fact that despite the author’s painstaking research, and his marvelous use of period photographs and documents, this factual account of historic events attending “The Osage Murders” contains the atmospheric suspense and tension that is normally associated with a classic murder mystery. In fact, Grann has written a murder mystery - One that asks who methodically killed hundreds of Osage Indians during a four-year reign of terror (1920-24). Osage history reveals the tragic details of how and why.\n\nForced to move from Kansas to Oklahoma, the Osage tribe seemed to be destined to lives of abject poverty when they suddenly found itself catapulted into a world of excessive wealth. Oil is discovered on tribal land. Suddenly, every member of the tribe is potentially wealthy. In an attempt to control the chaos that ensued, the federal government created a document called a “headright” which gave each Osage household legal rights to the oil on their land. After a period of uncontrolled spending in which members of the Osage tribe acquired mansions and fleets of automobiles, the government attempted to control the excessive spending by establishing a “guardian system” which assigned a “legal guardian” to each Osage family.\n\nThis “guardian” (usually a white banker, businessmen or “civic-minded citizen” was given the power to approve or deny all expenditures for the Osage tribal member (who had been judged to be “incompetent”) by the government. The system was badly flawed, and many of the guardians used their position to embezzle huge sums of money. In time, the guardian documents became bargaining chips in investing in business ventures. Hundreds of guardians used their position as a means of acting as a “middle-man” who would purchase items on behalf of Osage tribal members. The guardian would then sell the item to the Osage for an inflated price. For example, guardians could purchase automobiles on behalf of the Osage tribal member for $250 and then sell them to the Osage member that they represented for $2,500.\n\nAs the wealth of the Osage grew, so did the schemes for exploiting the tribe. Hundreds of criminals were drawn to the region with schemes designed to acquire a portion of Osage wealth. Many of these new arrivals openly stated that they had come to Oklahoma “to marry an Osage squaw.”\nIt was a method that frequently succeeded.\n\nHowever, some of these opportunists sought a more direct method: murder. Author Grann’s research discovers one individual, William Hale who had arranged for the murder of 24 members of the Osage tribe. By soliciting the help of associates, Hale became one of the wealthiest men in Oklahoma. The astonishing catalogue of slaughter is carried out by men willing to resort to any means to accomplish Hale’s goal. Dozens of victims were poisoned with tainted moonshine and corrupt medical personnel performed autopsies that listed “acute alcoholism” as the cause of death. Others were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head or between the eyes and the victim’s body was found in his new car on a remote road. One family was killed by a dynamite blast that demolished their home. Often, Hale simply paid an assassin to kill a designated victim. Then, Hale would frequently hire a second assassin to kill the first. In those instances in which murderers were apprehended, Hale bribed juries and law officials and if all else failed, he simply paid another killer.\n\nTime and time again, government agents are assigned to investigate and in some instances, just as they uncover significant evidence, they are murdered and the evidence destroyed. One dedicated investigator called the FBI headquarters to report that he was on his way back with conclusive evidence against Hale. The next day his mutilated body is found near a railroad track. He had been murdered and thrown from the train. Another investigator’s body was found in another state, hundreds of miles away. What is most disquieting about the crimes in Killers of the Flower Moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in the book. State and government officials, medical personnel and lawyers - all are contaminated with the vice of greed. The corruption is so pervasive, the few moral and courageous individuals seem helplessly outnumbered.\n\nHowever, there are two remarkable people in this gruesome tale. One is Molly Burkhart, and Osage who survived the systematic murder of her family...murders in which her husband was implicated. Molly was diagnosed as a diabetic by two doctors who poisoned her insulin injections, in an attempt to slowly kill her. Molly survived and divorced her husband. The second remarkable character is Tom White, the FBI agent that pursued Hale until he brought him to justice. Much of the credit of for this amazing piece of investigative work went to the Director of the newly-created FBI agency, Hubert Hoover who turned out to be a man dedicated to his own self-interest. Through much of the investigation conducted by Tom White, Hoover managed to take credit for White’s courageous work. Jealous of any publicity directed toward agents other than himself, Hoover invariably succeeded in manipulating the factual data to his advantage.\n\nThis is a remarkable work. Most noteworthy is Grann’s comprehensive account of the primitive nature of investigations in a time before forensics emerged. As a consequence, much of Tom White’s heroic pursuit of a villain who seemed to have the protection of most of Oklahoma’s judges, lawyers and public officials. However, Grann’s greatest achievement is the fact that he uncovers evidence that the total number of victims in the Osage murders exceeded the original 24 and possibly exceeded over 200.",
    "This book was recommended to me by a friend who is of Osage descent. The fact that I had never heard of the Osage people in my history classes confirmed that I needed to read this book. The story is shocking and beyond disturbing, not only because of the tragic and horrific loss of life and grand exploitation of the Osage people, but because this part of American history is not taught in schools and isn’t represented in any history books used in modern education. How chilling it is when history can be erased, but the only people that know it’s been erased and changed are the victims of the erasure. Thank you David Grann for your work. Thank you to the brave men and women who dared to share your stories. May we as a nation start to teach all the aspects and facets of our history, both the horrors and the beauties. For if we don’t, we are not only at risk of, but could also be deemed complicit in, continuing and repeating those works of evil.",
    "This is a terrific read. Very compelling and thoroughly, exhaustively researched. David Grann does a truly masterful and heartfelt job of relaying this heartbreaking tale of murder, betrayal, and deceit. Grann has a unique and captivating way of telling this wrenching story of the Reign Of Terror on the Osage Indians to murder them and steal their 'headrights' on the massive mineral deposits (oil and gas) on their federal lands given them by the US government, finally in 1877. This came only after all the white immigrants and settlers had killed thousands of them, starved them, by disease, pushed them off, outright stole the bulk of all their other beautiful, lush, and rich lands, originally in what is now Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas, where their ancestors had lived for hundreds and hundreds of years. The US government broke one treaty after another until they were eventually moved to a portion of what is now Oklahoma.\n\"Osage: (Ni-u-kon-ska), \"People of the Middle Waters\", is a Midwestern Native American tribe of the Great Plains. The tribe developed in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys around 700 BC along with other groups of its language family. They migrated west after the 17th century, settling near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, as a result of Iroquois invading the Ohio Valley in a search for new hunting grounds.\" - Wiki\nThere were many more than the 24 innocent Osage murdered during the \"Reign Of Terror\" after oil was discovered on their Osage Reservation in 1906. Grann in his scrupulous research and interviews eventually discovers over 650 suspicious deaths, predominantly Osage tribal members, but also anyone white who attempted to help them or knew too much about the murderous gang of conspirators. Even after rich cattleman and Osage 'guardian', William K. Hale, his two nephews, Ernest, and Byron (aka Bryan) Burkhart, and their heinous fellow henchmen were finally proven guilty and locked up in Leavenworth from June 1926- June 1929, the murders and mysterious deaths went on, ignored, and uninvestigated by all local Oklahoma authorities. From sheriffs to mayors, judges, Representatives, Senators, governors, police, state and county officials, doctors, coroners, from the very rich and influential to the penniless down and outers, ruthless whites led and together participated in the entire travesty. The murders were carried out by various insidious means, be it shooting, blowing them up as they slept, beatings, countless chilling heartless methods, often by poison or morphine injections, and all by greedy whites time and time again. Their recurring method of marrying into the tribe was always only for one reason: to inherit their money. Unfortunately, it seems they never married for love. The betrayals are endless.\nI won't spoil it for you, but the disappointment over the lack of followthrough of the Oklahoma justice system left me disgusted. Let me know how you feel about Bryan Burkhart's marriage after you finish the book. It's a real shake your head, life can't get any stranger tale... or can it?\nIt is my hope that one of my all-time favorite film directors, Martin Scorcese, and co-producer and exceptional actor, Leonardo DeCaprio, do justice to Mr. Grann's marvelous book in their upcoming film, but most of all I hope that they honor the Osage Nation, all their ancestors, and descendants that have suffered so deeply for generations of ominous, immeasurable, and callous cruelty.\nI find it both odious and telling that this story, the film based on Grann's book, the telling of mass murder and racial oppression, should come into the light on exactly the 100th anniversary of Tulsa, Oklahoma's Greenwood Massacre. The final injustice would be if these shameful and outrageous events in our American history continued to be removed from our history books. That would be a national sacrilege.\nOne of my favorite lines from Killers Of Flower Moon is a quote of the Osage descendant and retired teacher, Mary Webb. At the end of her interview with the author, she said, \"This land is saturated in blood.\" Then, she repeated a quote when God cried out to Abel after he killed Cain \"The blood cries out from the ground.\"\nGood book, highly recommend.",
    "Firstly I would state that this is a very well written book - it isn't till you read such examples you realize what a difference it makes to your overall enjoyment! I did not find it too journalistic like some other reviewers (though David Grann is a staff writer) and the author as the footnotes and Appendices show, has great command of voluminous historic paper data.\n\nSecondly, the tale it tells works so well because while it is at heart a 1920s crime story it uses the backdrop of the history of Native Americans and their treatment at the hands of the US government and white settlers to provide a much wider panorama to the events and the crimes. In this case the sudden growth of the domestic US oil industry at the turn of the century, created the situation that one of the largest oil reserves was found on the reservation of the Osage Indian nation in recently established Oklahoma. Ironically the tribe had only ended up there because of being forced off its original tribal lands by the government but had wisely in negotiating its purchase preserved its mineral rights. This quickly led to untold wealth and inevitably attracting interest from numerous white persons keen to acquire a share of the new wealth, given the historic approach in the USA to Native Americans.\n\nWhile the attempts by politicians in Washington, early oil magnates and local business and financiers in such a corruptible frontier environment to acquire personal gain provides the backdrop, the central story is the increasing use of cross marriage and murder to try and inherit family interests and ownership of such wealth which takes up the first two thirds of the book. Add into that mix the foundling National Bureau of Investigation (later to morph into the FBI) under its first appointed head Edgar J. Hoover and a scandal that in 1920s USA could not be tackled by openly corrupt local and state law enforcement was a heaven sent opportunity to prove the new national policing approach.\n\nThe real hero of the tale is Tom White, originally a Texas Ranger who had recently joined the Bureau and was in retrospect the wise choice by Hoover that by his team's success helped make the reputation of his Bureau in leading the investigation. Sadly as with all such examples Hoover's autocratic approach reflected little subsequent gratitude but what moves the story beyond its crime plot is the final third where without giving the details away the proving of a wider conspiracy many years later after events had been forgotten is the real revelation.",
    "The Osage Indians lived in Kansas until the 1870s when the government decided that their land was too valuable for them to own, and the Osage Indians were being forced off their land. The Osage Indians were moved to Northeastern Oklahoma on a patch of ground that was deemed worthless - until oil was discovered beneath the reservation land in the 1920s, those dirt scratching Indians became extremely wealthy. The federal government, due to the Osages’ inherent racial weakness, deemed them incapable of managing their own affairs and appointed guardians to manage their affairs, white guardians. Guardians who controlled their money for their own benefit - buying a car for $250, and selling it to their appointed dependee at $1,250 for a healthy profit. However, the tale of greed escalates to one of murder and a devilish plot to murder its womenfolk one by one, in a coldly calculated order, as would gradually bequeath their riches to white speculators in the end by the only viable means: inheritance. And here lies the macabre intimacy that marks this out from other stories of mass killing of American Indians: inheritance, of course, entailed marrying Native women, raising children with them while knowing the plan’s murderous outcome. Every effort is co-ordinated by the wealthy and the institutions of white settlersto hamper investigations until the fledgling FBI steps in.\n\nThis is a well written - factual but in a flowing narrative, which takes you on a journey of first hand experience of how the First Nation people have been shamefully treated by the American's and their institutions and legal systems.\n\nDavid Grann has done a wonderful job of investigating these murders. Though some people were incarcerated for the crimes back in the 1920s, the more Grann dug, the more threads he found that led to other guardians who should have been investigated more thoroughly as well.",
    "I don't normally read crime books but this was part of a book club and I was interested enough to purchase a copy. I'm glad I did.\n\nThe book is a mix of crime, who dunnit and history, both of the time in the US and also the development of the FBI. Most of my problem with popular history books, and I would put this book in that genre, is that the author writes with confidence about private conversations and thoughts that they cannot possibly know about. This book keeps that to a minimum as the archives provides lots of information so, while there is a bit of poetic license taken in places, on the whole you do feel like you are reading about the facts rather than the author's imagination.\n\nThe actual events desribed are interesting and shocking, particularly when you think about how recently these events took place.\n\nI would recommend this book to a lot of different readers as it is well paced and certainly brings out the human drama in these historic events and covers lots of different subject areas.",
    "Years ago, back in the Stone Age, I remember seeing a James Stewart movie called \"The FBI Story\", and episodic - and somewhat hagiographic - history of J Edgar Hoover's decades long expansion of the then Justice Department Bureau of Investigation. One of the episodes covered the Bureau's investigation of the systematic murders of a large number of very rich members of the Osage Nation, a native American tribe living in Oklahoma. At the time, I was sure this was made up. I mean, based on what we hear about the mistreatment and exploitation of the native peoples, whoever heard of a rich Indian?\n\nImagine then, my great surprise when I ran across this book and realized the story was actually true. The Osage were indeed a very wealthy tribe, based on their ownership of mineral rights on their land in Oklahoma which is, if you know your geology, oil country. Since the idea of rich Indians offended the sensibilities of the right-thinking folk in old Oklahoma, there followed a long drawn out campaign to separate the Osage from their money, ultimately culminating (but not actually ending) in at least two dozen savage murders between 1921 and 1925, a period referred to by the Osage as the \"reign of terror\".\n\nIt's a shocking and almost unknown story, and the full extent of what happened during that period is not fully and publicly known to this day. Grann, a staff writer at the New Yorker, does make a manful attempt to let the light in, and to be fair, he does a good job on that aspect of the case. He covers the background of the terror, how the Osage came to be in the position they were and how local forces conspired to relieve them of what was theirs, by any means. It should be a mesmerizing read, and yet, it isn't. It's good, and you'll finish it, but somehow it doesn't grip like a book of this nature should. Perhaps it's the sheer, jaw-dropping extent of the conspiracy against the Osage, requiring the reader to keep track of large numbers of people in their minds. Perhaps it's the autonomous actions of different groups and individuals which makes for a somewhat incoherent narrative. Whatever it is, I couldn't go above three stars for this one. Maybe three and a half. A pity, because this is an important story which should be out there, and Grann has done a decent job bringing all the facts to light.",
    "A grim chapter of American history is brought to light with Killers of the Flower Moon, a book specifically about the Osage Native Americans and their betrayal by the government. Furnished with incredible wealth due to the oil on their land, the Osage should have thrived. Unfortunately, greed from outside forces took over and soon the Osage's land was plundered by the US government - something of a repeated motif in the nascent history of America. Within that there were also others who, jealous of the wealth, manufactured ways of eliminating certain families within the community. This leads to a cover-up and the eventual establishment of the FBI who slowly uncover the mystery.\nIt's an enlightening read in many ways while its unusual to read J Edgar Hoover and the FBI as the heroes of the piece - at least initially. The problem is that what is a story about racial injustice - of this there can be no doubt - it does veer into a heavy-handed polemic. It's been fashionable in post-60s writing to simplify the story of America as 'White Christian Man Bad' - and we've all seen the joyous division that's sown! - but in a case as unfair as this, we really do not need the blanket statement seeping into everything. At one point an interesting discussion of how new-money Osage natives were patronisingly given overseers - it was deemed that they were too silly to cope with the riches on their own - verges into some nonsensical point about gender politics. It suggests that these overseers created specific gender roles that were alien to the people (Christian White Man Bad time) whereas even a cursory look at history would show that Osage culture already had defined gender roles. This was a bad thing, an evil thing or an incursion of 'patriarchy' on the Osage - it was just a simple fact of tradition. To use that as a stick to beat the settlers with is disingenuous. Ultimately, this is still a recommended book - it's worth paying the extra for the audiobook to hear some of it read in Will Patton's exquisite South Carolina drawl - but any sense of balance often disappears in tendentious writing."

    "Damn this book is really good. Roland Martin, with Leah Lakins, wrote a modern day history book that doesn't hold back on the truth of this country....from the past to the present.\n\"White Fear\" explains and lays out the racism of America in politics, ecomonics, education, and history. It explains demographics, how important voting is, how even white people are against racism, and what needs to be done to fight racism.\nThe cover of this book shows in vivid detail what we have been saying all along.....especially with the hashtag: \"We tried to tell you.\"\nThis book is a must read.",
    "Roland did an excellent job writing this book! Very detailed timeline of history of violent events that happened when black Americans make progress in this country. It’s a call to action for our allies. He has one short chapter on black Republicans and it’s a call to action for them. I think it could’ve have been longer because in 2022 the blk Trumplicans are WS apologists who constantly gaslight liberals and weaponize their blkness. They have not an ounce of integrity.",
    "This an excellent book, which forces the reader to acknowledge the realities that result from \"White.

He supplies humanity, truth, justice, and feeling. This terrible tragedy that happened because a couple of boys were trying to make a quick buck and ended up making a terrible decision that affected so many, is just the beginning of the terrible world we live in today.",

    "How or why I haven’t read this book before (July 2022), I don’t know. And, in all honestly, I had a hard time getting into it, mainly because I knew what to expect and I was afraid to read the violent scenes. But Capote didn’t rush into a description of the dreadful murders: he eased into the events of that night by first describing how the murders were discovered. Only later in the book did he talk about the events as perpetrated by the murderers. By then the book became a page turner for me. Capote’s prose is minutely detailed yet eloquent, a great study into the psychology of the criminal mind.",

Because of the subject matter, I knew what was to come, and I wished that it were within my power to warn the family to leave the house, but to no avail. I expected to maintain the same level of emotional involvement throughout the second half of the book as Capote addressed the fate of the perpetrators, but that was not to be. I often felt that I was reading a text on legal jurisprudence. When i finished the book, I felt that I neither loved nor hated the outcome. From an author's perspective, my reaction was the worst possible. I just did not care one way or the other.",

    "\"In Cold Blood\" is an iconic non fiction book that is authored by an iconic fiction writer, Truman Capote. The story is about a real life, hideous violent crime that occurred in the State of Kansas in 1959. Although non fiction, the book has the style of fiction and reads as a hard crime thriller, \"page turner\". In a case such as this, I don't wish to say that I \"enjoyed\" this book. The crime is disgusting. However the writing is excellent. As a retired police investigator of violent felonies, the entire work had the ring of truth and reality for me.\n\nI had put off reading this book up until now for numerous reasons. As a student of literature and authors, I prefer to read books by authors in order of publication so that I can study the evolution, if any, of the author. Also, in this case, I am a retired police,officer suffering from PTSD. Therefore it was with a good deal of hesitation that I decided to finally read this work. I do need to report to you that I did indeed find it personally very painful. I have worked cases like this and they have stayed with me. In some ways, the old scars were opened To some extent. It was not as bad as I was afraid it would be. (I had asked others about this prior to reading the book.)\n\nObviously all I know about this case is what I have read. Presuming the work is accurate, I can tell you this is what is like to arrive at the scene of a hideous violent felony in which there are no witnesses and no obvious leads, To a conscientious lead investigator, it is almost impossible to convey the feeling of near hopeless, forlorn, desolation that may descend upon \"The Lead\" in a case such as this. Truman Capote does a really good job in describing all of this. It proved extremely realistic to me.\n\nOf all the books that I have ever read, if I was instructing a course on homicide investigations, I am positive I could use this book as a core text. I know exactly how I would have worked this \"job\" after all of the primary work and leads had been run down. Often I was assigned cases such as this after the primary work was done, and the investigation had stalled. The police \"caught a break\" in this case. However the break came from exactly the type of source that I would have pursued. Believe me it is a complete pain to work a case this way, but it can be done proactively rather than waiting for a break. This is not \"normal aberrant\" behavior. This is a subset of aberrant behavior, that I refer to as \"aberrant of aberrant\". the very nature of which, that makes this job solvable...\n\nIn summary, this is an excellent work of non fiction. The only hesitation I have in recommending this work is the hideous nature of the crime. This crime fits my personal definition of obscenity. However if you are a young detective assigned to violent crimes, and really want to learn and not just \"Mail it in\" this is the one.... Thank You for taking the time to read this review.",
    "True story. Entertaining.",
    "Truman Capote’s 1966 account of a notorious, barely motive-driven rural multiple murder which took place in Kansas in 1959 catapulted him into the best seller lists and celebrity status.\n\nAn upstanding, hard-working family from Holcomb, a small community in the wheat-plains of western Kansas, were brutally murdered by person or persons unknown, in November 1959. The Clutter family, Herb, church-going, teetotal dairy cattle-farmer, his rather delicate but equally upstanding wife Bonnie, and his two children, 16 year old Nancy, vivacious, popular, responsible, admired, and her bookish 15 year old brother Kenton were all shot at point-blank range, having previously been tied up. Herb Clutter also had his throat cut before being shot.\n\nInevitably, investigation first turned to possible personal and local motive, but there was no evidence at all to suggest this. The community was a tight-knit, respectable, co-operative one, and all the Clutters were warmly regarded by their colleagues, peers, friends, family and neighbours\n\n“The hitherto peaceful congregation of neighbours and old friends had suddenly to endure the unique experience of distrusting each other; understandably, they believed that the murderer was amongst themselves”\n\nThe conclusion was that this might have been a burglary which went wrong. The idea of this definitely ruled out local involvement as everyone knew that Clutter did not keep money or valuables in the house, but banked it\n\nThe crime seemed to point towards something of a growing trend – murder without any real personal motive. There have always been such, in times past, but, for obvious reasons, they were more likely to take place in crowded cities, where perpetrators could quickly vanish amongst the hordes. Such crimes in isolated areas, carried out by perpetrators completely unknown, where victim and murderer had no direct connection with each other, must have been comparatively rare before owning cars became common, so that going on the run and being able to hide anywhere, became easily possible.\n\nThe perpetrators of this crime, after an intense investigation, were found to be a couple of small time crooks, who had met whilst serving time, far away from the scene of the crime. The successful solving of the crime, not to mention the capture of the pair, also depended on chance as much as skill, and the existence of mass-media (radio, TV) to highlight awareness of the crime and the search. The motive was indeed a robbery gone wrong, with the murderers, neither of whom had ever met Clutter, unaware that this rich man did not have a safe in his house (as they had assumed he would)\n\nTruman Capote’s account of the case, originally serialised in The New Yorker, was rather a literary, ground-breaking one. The book was extensively researched from documents and interviews, but Capote structured this like a converging story, rather than a linear account. The structure, the language and the shaping are that of story, not journalistic reportage. Indeed, levelled against the book was criticism (particularly locally) that some dialogue had been invented, and small human touches and potent images had been invented.\n\nInterestingly, his researcher on the book was his friend, and later, admired author, in her own right, Harper Lee. She is one of the two people Capote dedicates the book to.\n\nThe crime was indeed a gory one, but Capote withholds the gory details until near the end of the book, Instead, he paints a low-key, un-histrionic , unheroic, un-villainous picture of all the individuals associated with the case – this includes the victims, the murderers and all connected in the investigation, bringing to justice, and the community in which these events happened.\n\nThe author avoids operatic, overblown rhetoric. The reader (well, this one) has the sense of an author listening for a way to tell a shocking story in a simple, measured way, allowing the events themselves to be revealed in a way which suggests they have objective existence, and are not driven by authorial agenda. Nonetheless, the choices he made do of course shape the reader’s own perceptions. This is not a mere recounting of facts, but the reader is not being punched by the writer’s persona. Nonetheless, it is obvious that Capote did feel a kind of fascination with one of the perpetrators, whose status as half Cherokee, half-Irish, child of a broken marriage, whose mother was an alcoholic, and who spent part of his childhood in a brutal care home, marked his card, somewhat from the start. A classic outsider who FELT like an outsider to himself. Capote, himself an outsider, clearly felt some kind of – if not sympathy, than an identification of ‘outsiderness’\n\nUnlike a more modern trend in some ‘true crime’ writing, Capote avoids a ramping up of the gory details of the undoubtedly gory crime. He is not trying to titillate or be gratuitous, Instead, there is a cool restraint. There is of course no ‘excuse’ for the crime, but there is a recognition that the fact that these types of crime occur shows ‘something’ about human nature. Because the writer does not go the route of ‘aberrant, demonic, despicable, bestial monsters’ the reader is uncomfortably forced to acknowledge this too is the possibility of human choice, human behaviour.",
    "In November 1959, two men drove into the small Kansas farming community of Holcomb, broke into the Clutter family’s home and brutally murdered the four occupants, Herb and Bonnie Clutter and their two teenage children, Nancy and Kenyon. Before the murderers were caught, Truman Capote decided to write about the crime, so went to Holcomb to interview friends and neighbours of the victims, residents of the town, and the men investigating the case. It wasn’t long before the perpetrators were identified and captured, so Capote continued his project by writing about the trial and its aftermath – the imprisonment and execution of the murderers, Perry Smith and Richard “Dick” Hickock. This book, first published in 1966, is the result.\n\nCapote approaches the subject from three angles, the victims, the townspeople and the murderers, with the narrative rotating among them. The Clutters, as portrayed here, were fine people, upstanding members of their community and their church, good neighbours and well respected. The children, especially Nancy, seem almost too good to be true, and I couldn’t help but wonder how much the old adage of never speaking ill of the dead had influenced the picture Capote paints. So even at this early stage of the book, I had begun to wonder how much reliance could be placed on Capote’s account of the people involved.\n\nThis feeling grew as the book progressed and Capote recounted as if they were facts things that he could only have learned from his interviews. While this may be fair enough with regards to the innocent people involved (though even then, oral testimony, especially when given not under oath, is notoriously unreliable), taking the words of Hickock and Smith at their own evaluation and drawing inferences as to their characters from this shaky evidence left me in a kind of limbo as to whether the book should be considered “true crime” or a fictionalised novel. I believe it gets categorised as a “non-fiction novel” - a description that seems deeply contradictory and problematic to me, designed to allow inaccuracies to pass unchallenged.\n\nTo be clear, I found it extremely readable and, viewing it as fiction, the characterisation of the murderers is wholly credible. Capote seeks to understand them by going back through their early experiences for clues as to why they turned out as they did. Smith in particular had a terrible childhood, with an alcoholic mother who pretty much abandoned him and a father who was at best an intermittent presence and a disruptive one at that. Hickock is more difficult to pigeon-hole – his family seemed both respectable and caring. Capote ventures into psychiatry for answers, using the reports that were drawn up for the men by their defence team. He gives a relatively nuanced picture, neither seeking to whitewash them nor to wholly condemn.\n\nHis portrayal of the impact of this horrific crime on the small community is equally convincing. In a place where people didn’t feel the need to lock their doors at night, the intrusion of this horror seemed incredible, and Capote shows how for the first time neighbour began to suspect and fear neighbour. The arrest and conviction of the murderers couldn’t wholly put the genie back in the bottle, as Capote describes it – the townspeople’s feelings of security would never be the same.\n\nAn interesting omission is the perspective of the Clutters’ two older daughters, neither of whom lived at home. While Capote gives us some facts about them, we don’t get to know them at all nor to learn how they fared in the future. I could only assume that they refused to be interviewed for the book.\n\nSome of the later scenes felt too contrived to be true, and I later learned on looking at wikipedia that some of the people involved had indeed denied their truth. For example, the scene where the wife of Perry’s jailer holds his hand while he sobs after being sentenced to death felt like something written for a Cagney film (or perhaps copied from one). And the super convenient final scene, played out between the chief investigator and one of the friends of young Nancy, now all grown up, provides a heartwarming conclusion of the restoration of order and the rebirth of all that is good and hopeful in life, and I didn’t believe a single word of it. According to wikipedia, the investigator later denied that it ever happened.\n\nSo I have very mixed feelings about the book overall. It’s not got the essential truth to be true crime, and yet it’s presented too factually to really be considered a novel. And yet, it is beautifully written and intensely readable, and while it may not have factual truth, it feels as if, with regards to the personalities of the murderers, it may have achieved some kind of emotional truth – certainly emotional credibility, at any rate. I quite understand why it has a reputation as a classic of the genre – I’m just not sure what genre it’s a classic of. Perhaps it should be viewed as a one-off, uncategorisable. And as such, I’m happy to recommend it.",
    "It was on a list of books I should read. I knew Capote could string a sentence together. So I read it.\n\nBo-o-oring! The writing is genuinely excellent. It's novel-like - if you like your novels painfully slow and uneventful.\n\nLie: there's one event, and it's the one you already knew about, a murder, which takes about 100 pages to reach. Yes, the victims are humanised and fleshed out enough that you feel bad for them when the time comes. But then the crucial event occurs - off the page, so you don't know what happened! Thereby cutting out the only action that really takes place, in order to give you a reason to keep on with this terminally dreary book about straw-chewing tertiary characters feeling irrationally unsafe in their dull little town. Oh, how they're affected! Please, tell me more about these unimportant non-characters so that I don't have to read about the actual events.\n\nI don't mean to say I want a grisly depiction of a real-life murder. I don't want to belittle the trauma felt by a community. I'm saying that this book, whilst extremely good at being evocative of the time and place, whilst making every person in the story, including the villains, feel very real and 'known' (rather like a Stephen King novel, i.e. with interminable detail), has almost nothing to say. What's it about? It's a newspaper article stretched out to what feels like 500 pages. It feels important but only because it happened. Only we can't really be sure that X worried about a fruit pie or Y had a roll of mints in his pocket. Capote apparently went above and beyond to get all the details for this story (I gather there was some controversy, which is probably why this book is so rated), but it feels like there's a layer of made-up-ness over the top of these facts, which jars a little.\n\nNot as good as a novel, nor as good as a straight non-fictional account of events. But, line by line, it's very well written, and powerfully evocative, even if the 'plot' is very underwhelming. I don't regret reading it, but I find it hard to recommend.\n\n5/10\n\nDavid 'No, I couldn't have written it better' Brookes\nAuthor of 'Cycles of Udaipur'",
    "An outstanding and powerful work of literature, even more impressive because it conveyed true crimes, a profound investigative insight, the vivid sense of time and place, and the atmosphere that cloaked the evil events carried out on November 15 in 1959, in Holcomb, Kansas. Truman Capote is an artist that painted every detail of the story with such a detailed flow that causes us to stop and appreciate the surroundings rather than wishing the story was being pushed at a faster pace.\n\nLooking at America in the 50s from the perspective of a foreigner we often think more of a Holywood version of an innocent age, affluent, white picket fences, apple pie, and rock and roll pervading the airwaves. If anyone asked me when and where I'd liked to have lived it would have been the US in the 1950s. In Cold Blood smashes that image with the reality that cruelty can take away life, a community’s character and the idyllic vision I'd imagined above.\n\nThe murders of four of the Clutter family by Dick Hickock and Perry Smith for $40, stunned not only the population of Holcomb but ultimately a world-wide audience. My vision, I so wanted to believe of the US, couldn't have been better envisioned than by Holcomb in the 1950s, where families rarely locked their doors and the safety of the neighbourhood was never doubted. Hickock and Smith not only brutally destroyed the lives of four innocent people but destroyed the fundamental promise of safety in our own homes.\n\nThe story explores the background of the murderers, what drove them, how they considered what they had done, the investigation into the crimes, and the community that became fearful and suspicious that for a long time they did not know who was responsible. To achieve this nonfiction novel with such beautiful prose is a seminal point in literature where it is arguable that Capote created a new genre.\n\nI have for a long time been fascinated by the relationship between Truman Capote and Harper Lee and how they helped each other research and draft their renowned classics. It is interesting that Harper Lee had been inspired during the ‘In Cold Blood’ collaboration with Capote to research and use the case of Robert Burns who shot dead the serial killer, Reverend Willie Maxwell, to write her own true-crime novel - which never materialised. Another relationship Capote shattered during his years of self-destruction.\n\nI do believe this is a must-read novel and is surely a classic and a powerful combination of true-crime with such beautiful writing talent.",
    "I heard about this book on a radio program, having only heard of Truman Capote from writing Breakfast at Tiffany's. My curiosity was piqued by this being a \"true crime\" story. Before I started reading I did a little research, finding that the author heard of the crimes and went to visit the locals. He then wrote the book which was sold as a non-fiction account but is in the style of a novel with dialogue that he could not possibly have been aware of. A book that blurs the line between fact and fiction would have been a very new concept in the 1960s but the idea has been used many times since.\nThe first section of the book gives an amazing snapshot in time. It's November 1959 and we are in small town Kansas, focusing in on a family called the Clutters. Their world is far from perfect but it is pretty good. We also follow the killers on their way with a plan to murder. From the start we know who will be killed, who is going to do it and that it is going to happen soon - all giving the narrative a great darkness. There are then three more sections which divide roughly into the investigation, court case and aftermath.\nI picked the book up to read a few years but couldn't get into it so put it down and was never inspired to try again, until now. This time I was hooked immediately.\nThe books is full of detail that makes the characters easy to visualise and give the surroundings great atmosphere. Everyone is just getting along with their lives but all have different opinions of normal based on their individual experiences of life so far. Looking at the murderers so carefully is very clever as the reader gets to know them and starts to empathise at the same time as learning more about the impact of their actions. Perry and Dick are complicated men who have been treated badly by life. We then move on to trying to understand the torture of the Bureau agent who is investigating the crime.\nThe book was published just 7 years after the murders and it is clear why it was so controversial in that it made the \"monsters\" into human beings with sad stories and excuses (valid or not depending on your view).\nThe book is well rounded and draws the story to a great conclusion which being back some of those involved to show the reader how life moves on.\nFantastic that it says so much about the era and I would recommend it to anyone interested in crime."

If Scott really wrote this book, and there is no reason to believe he didn't, his story telling and writing could take him a long way in politics and in life.\n\nLike many of our presidents, Sen. Scott is a self-made man, the son of a single mom and a Vietnam Vet who experienced terrible racism in the military and suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome that ruined his marriage. He shows that it takes more than good moms and teachers to help a talented person succeed.\n\nSen. Scott's wonderful short stories tell us that even kids with mediocre teachers can prosper if they have the right parents, personalities, brains, luck, energy, health, coaches, bosses, mentors, friends, consultants, staff and political supporters.\n\nSen. Scott's brief career already has given him opportunities to impress millions of people, including powerful politicians and potential donors. Of the dozens of politicians who have tried to respond to a president's state of the union message, Sen. Scott is the only one who successfully made the most of the opportunity to speak on national TV. He was great!\n\nThe question is, where does he go from here?\n\nTo me, the book says he still is ambitious and considering running for president. As a Small Government, Never Trump, Never Biden Republican who is pro-choice and pro-civil rights for all, including gays, Sen. Scott has looked presidential for some time.\n\nAs the book shows, Sen. Scott is an optimist. He respects people who are different, including liberal reporters and editors who don't like Republicans. The country needs a president who talks up the country rather than exploit our anxieties for political power. Sen. Scott knows how to charm not only his supporters but also his partisan opponents.\n\nThings about the book leave me with questions.\n\nFirst, Sen. Scott doesn't discuss his personal life as a single person who doesn't have kids.\n\nThat means that while he knows a lot of folks who are raising kids and dealing with schools, there is a huge part of most voters' lives that he doesn't really relate to because he's not married and he doesn't have kids.\n\nIt's kind of like we whites can't really relate to how racism affects blacks and other minorities. Those of us who don't have kids don't and can't really relate to what parents and grand parents experiences teach them about human nature. I'd like to see an interview with Scott on this topic.\n\nSecond, Sen. Scott tells stories about his dealings with former President Trump. By his telling, he had some very impressive encounters with Trump, including one in which the president took the Senator's mother for a ride on Air Force One and entertained her during the flight. He seems to feel indebted to Trump. That makes me a bit uncomfortable. He also discusses how he confronted Trump with his differences with Trump on critical racial issues and how Trump listened to him and picked up on his idea for helping poor people.\n\nI worry that Sen. Scott's affection for Trump might cost him the general election votes of people who don't like Trump. If he's the VP nominee, it won't matter.\n\nSen. Scott is a very good and effective speaker. His book and performance so far in public life give me hope that he'll face up to the Trump problem and find a way to continue to grow and prosper as an important U.S. senator, and maybe more.",
    "Only a person with a good character and a positive vision of life could have written this book because it was really written from his heart. I have always admired and truly like Senator Tim Scott, which is why I chose to read his book. He so generously shares many fascinating stories of his family, friends and himself. His faith, intelligence and constant determination has guided him to live his life with purpose and meaning. Through his stories I learned so much about him and see that his life was never easy or predictable but he put every event into building blocks to guide him along. There are many valuable lessons people can learn from him and I believe that we should be much more aware of what we think and feel and use our own life experiences to get us to our next life chapter. We have all, at one time or another moved ahead in life, maybe with blinders, with no plan and just let life itself move us along as if we are riding a wave and traveling alone. What I believe Senator Scott’s strongest message is to look, feel and experience life with deeper meaning, awareness and direction. Notice those around us and realize we are never alone and we can learn from others and also realize the wonderful feeling that maybe we also have influenced others by being a kinder and better person. You cannot build a house without a plan, and life is just as complicated so we need to think in those terms. His strongest message is the reinforcement that we are so fortunate to live in a country that has no boundaries that limit us, but allows us to accomplish the most we can within our power. History has shown that America had its difficult times, boundaries and blockaides and many people suffered to help eliminate and overcome them. That history paved our way. The only limit is what we put on ourself.",
    "Tim Scott is a voice we need to listen to more. His story chooses to see the best in others, even those who disagree with him politically. He has faced racism and discrimination, yet chooses not to focus on the past but to work to make things better for the future - his and future generations. I love his strong faith, and it's obvious that is what makes Tim the person that he is. If you need to know there are at least a few people in Washington DC that are trying to do the right thing and working for us, then this book will restore your faith in that hope. While Tim is swimming against the tide, he won't give up because he believes in America and in her people. Thank you Tim Scott for writing this book! It gives me hope for the future of our country, even in today's climate.",
    "Everyone should take some time out of their day to read and enjoy a book as powerful as Senator Tim Scott's. It is a book of wisdom, love of his fellow humans, humor and a life well done as we all should do.\nI feel honored that the Senator should reveal his life to us for all the good and all the bad.\nThank you Senator Tim Scott for opening the eyes of many of us to the realities of our world with your book.",
    "The book is a collection of stories, true stories of American lives. I was surprised by what a good narrative writer is, the stories are vignettes that keep you reading, wanting to hear the next one.\nFor the last couple years I have been overwhelmed by the injustices experienced in our country. Now I’m taking time to focus on the opportunity, the inspiration the irrepresive belief that each of us can make the life we want. This book is all about that. And I love his use of exclamation points!",

    "To be completely honest, I decided to read this book, titled Surrounded by Idiots - The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life), after a particularly difficult day of teaching high school students. I saw the words “Surrounded by Idiots” in the list of options and thought, yup that’s the one. Every teacher can relate to those difficult days sometimes, but the ideas Erikson writes about in this book can be relatable to anyone at any time. He starts off explaining that we, in fact, are not surrounded by idiots. We are simply surrounded by people who are different than us and who think differently than us. Everyone has a tendency to think people who are different than us are idiots, but that is not necessarily the case.\nPerhaps if I was having a better day when I chose to read this book, I would have looked at the rest of the title – “The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and Life).” This is a little more descriptive of the ideas Erikson touches on. The four types of human behavior, as Erikson explains it, is broken down into four different colors. This is just his way of organizing the information, but I find it clever and easy to follow. Erikson says on page 13, that most of the population is a combination of two colors, while few are purely one color or a mixture of three colors. He starts off with just describing personality characteristics of each color and how to recognize if someone in your life is a red, yellow, green, or blue. I very much enjoyed this, because I could pin point exact people in my life and what color they are. My sister is a dead on Red for instance. Throughout all the chapters of Surrounded by Idiots, I could confirm my sister is a Red in the way she handles conflict, in her body language, in how she sends emails (my sister and I are also coworkers), and in what “makes her mad as hell” as Erikson puts it.\nI am a self-proclaimed Green. My Red sister and I get along great in social situations, but when it comes to making plans… that is a different story. Erikson talks about how the different colors work together and what challenges they may face starting on page 193. This got me thinking more about work related relationships, and I’ve got to say, Erikson is completely right in his assessment of collaborating colors. I won’t spoil all the details for you, but again it brought up situations I’ve been in with coworkers, etc. You may be able to tell from what I’ve written so far, but it was extremely difficult for me to not think of every single person in my life (work or social) and how they match up with the different colors in this book and the relationship I have with people of each personality type. This was enjoyable to me.\nErikson touches on many character traits, in work and social situations, of all four colors and how they communicate with the other colors – hence the more descriptive part of the title. He also gives plenty real life examples of coworkers of his or friends of his and their interactions. This made it realistic or relatable to me. I will say, it is kind of hard not to get defensive or think “nu uh, you’re wrong Erikson!” when he describes the weakness of the color(s) you identify with most. But keep in mind, and Erikson will remind also remind you, we are all human and no one or one personality color is perfect or superior. Overall, I very much enjoyed reading Surrounded by Idiots even though it was not the book I thought it was when I hit “buy with one click” on Amazon. As a teacher, I would highly recommend this book to other teachers because you will think of certain students or coworkers who are Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue as you read and get insight on how to work with them in a productive and empathetic manner. I’d give the book a 4.5/5. (I’d give it a 5, but it touched on some of my Green insecurities). The book is $14.99 here on Amazon and is 270 pages in length.",
    "This book describes four behavior types by sorting them into colors: red, blue, green and yellow. People that are sorted into these behavior types typically exhibit the same characteristics. For example, the book claims that green individuals are typically laid back and sometimes struggle to make decisions. Since teachers need to be able to understand and manage behavior, this book can be a foundation for how we interpret different social situations with students. While Erikson does point out that we should not use this classification method on children, it does give us some background knowledge on students and what drives behavior (e.g. environment).\nThere are many aspects of the book that I enjoyed. The book begins with a description of how and why he and his father began classifying behavior in this way. They used what is called the DISC method to establish these four behavior types. He explains that most people are a combination of two or three behavior types; very few people are just one type. Erikson describes the basis of behavior – what causes us to behave in the way that we do. He then moves on to provide an overview of the system, listing characteristics of each color in a diagram provided on page thirteen. After this introduction, he dives into how we can recognize each behavior type, how each behavior type deals with stress, which behavior types are best suited to work together, how to give feedback to each behavior type and so on. In chapter nineteen, Erikson provides examples of how people who have been sorted into the different behavior types react to different questions about their behavior and the book. Each of these people who were interviewed have read the book and are able to explain how they feel about the portrayal of individuals who belong to the group they do – most of them seem almost annoyed. For example, Hakan seems annoyed that the interviewer points out what he says is contradictory. The book ends with an interactive quiz, which is perhaps one of my favorite parts. It allows the reader to self-assess and determine what they took from this book and how they (now) understand the different behavior types.\nWhile there are not many things that I would change about the book, there are some pieces that could help provide some clarity for the reader. I loved how each behavior was talked about in detail; however, there were some parts where I really had to stop and think about what behavior was being talked about and reflect on what was said about that “color” chapters beforehand. This was likely due to the fact that it would spend the course of four chapters talking about each behavior type individually in relation to one concept or situation. It may have been better for the author to adjust this so that each situation was talked about for a single behavior type. For example, perhaps chapters four through nine could have talked about just green behavior, describing the different situations, scenarios and ideas that are discussed for that behavior throughout the book. This was not a huge issue since there were a variety of visuals, but it may be difficult for some readers who lack reading comprehension skills or have problems organizing information in their minds.",
    "Great read",
    " This is a very insightful piece. Even if you are familiar with your own behaviors, it helps you understand the behaviors of everyone around you. A profound entry as to why most people behave the way they do. Pair this with the Art of Seduction, and your communication skills will be unparalleled",
    "I have been studying this topic for three to four years, now, and this book finally got it through my head (as a Yellow, personally. You'll understand what I mean if you read this book!) I couldn't be happier!\nI regret nothing at all reading through this book, not a second of my time has been wasted!\nClear enough for anyone to understand, including me, and I'm one of those idiots you're surrounded by!\n\nI can't recommend it enough. It's helpful not only in a business sense but even just in any everyday scenario. In just half the book, I was already out in the real world applying my knowledge and absolutely nailing it.\n\nBest book I've read on this, and may read again if I need any refreshers in the future!\n\nFive-est of stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
    "Informative and entertaining; helped narrow down some co-workers and friends as to whom is which color; will certainly suggest to others",
    "This is such a bad book that I don't know where to start. I want to say 'Trust me, don't waste your money, go spend it on junk food 'cos it'll be better for you.' In fact almost anything else would be better value. This is poorly-written nonsense.\n\nThe author posits four different types of people, So you'd think there would be a self-assessment tool of some sort, wouldn't you? No such thing. I suppose you're meant to self-identify, but this isn't helped by a pretty strong overlap between the different types. And of course there's no offering to help you identify the other people you might meet. The author does admit that you may be a mix of more than one type, but this isn't really discussed. And there's nothing at all about how people develop and grow over time, which is important.\n\nThe self-assessment is based loosely on the DiSC model, which is highly questionable. However, in the original model the C stands for 'compliance,' but out author has changed this to 'analytical ability.' What?????????? No way, in the dictionary or in personality theory, can you equate 'compliance' with 'analytical ability.' In fact there's a strong case for saying that they're mutually exclusive, because people with strong analytical skills don't usually accept what's on offer in compliant fashion. I had to bang my head several times before I could believe that this is really what he'd written; what's happened to the profession of copy-editor? (A good copy-editor would have killed that title as much too confrontational).\n\nThere's some loose analysis of the four different types and advice on getting on with them, but the advice is so general and/or it begs the question - summarised as 'do the right thing and try not to annoy them.' And the book is difficult to read - there's no sense of structure or flow, no sense of guiding curious readers to the next thing they'll be interested in. Why this book found its way into the best-seller lists is an utter puzzle.",
    "The book is a traffic light system of colours to be used in a money making attempt to put people into boxes. It's mind numbing drivel from an author that views himself as half red and half yellow (the two most powerful and creative colours - surprise surprise).\nThe cheeky title sells the book but there is nothing of value inside. Take people as you find them, and treat those you work with well, you don't need a get rich quick book to do this (author getting rich that is).",
    "Quite possibly the most boring book I have read in years! I kept going with the hope I'd learn something new, but it just keeps repeating itself and it's filled with the most unbelievable 'real-life' scenarios that make it laughable. It offers some mild amusement in moments where you can recognise a friend or colleague's behaviour - but it hardly warrants assigning them a colour/letter/element for it. I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it again.",
    "I read this book whilst also reading 'Behave' by Sapolsky, and the contrast between them is extreme. This book is incredibly basic. The author claims this book is based on 'basic research', research that I struggle to believe exists (it definitely isn't referenced, and the further reading list is of no help either). If you want to truly understand human behaviour, read Sapolsky, then you'll have a more accurate sense that behaviour is incredibly complex and cannot ever be boiled down to a 4 segment model that was used by Aztecs and Greeks (something that is brought up in this book to prove the models reliability... WHAT). This books message is akin to astrology. People cannot be categorised so easily, things are too complex and it's somewhat insulting to suggest otherwise. The author modestly utilises reviews (probably fake, or extremely cherry-picked, as they complement his argument ever so well) at the end of the book to prove his suggested theory as right, yet failed to include any reviews challenging the horoscopic, simple, pseudo-science nature of this book.\n\nI've read a lot on human behaviour, I have read most of this books recommended reading list, and most of those books aren't really all that relevant to this books message. I can see this has a lot of reviews and most are positive, meaning this is probably for the general audience. Maybe the book isn't intended for people who care about the subject, but please don't think these ideas are accepted in the psychology/behavioural academic literature.\n\nI finished the book, and certain parts were enjoyable, so I can't give it a one star review. Yes, the use of the 4-segment model may not be terrible in some circumstances, but this is definitely not an academic or scientific read, which disappointed me, as the author says they have had many years in the field, yet nothing new was brought to the table.",
    "Great book gives accurate understandable information. Provides insight for both self awareness and awareness of others. I’m a CBT therapist and I have recommended it to some of my clients"

    "If you want to know what the elites have in store for the rest of us, you must read The Great Reset. There are those in big business, Government, Banks, and other large institutions who are planning a revolution that puts all power in their hands. They want to determine the future of economic policy for every nation.\n\nThese large groups will take away individual freedom. They plan to use their power to create a world where they can control every aspect of our life. They claim that these changes will “save” the planet from extinction. Their plans ignore human nature. They ignore economic reality and believe that they can print and spend as much money as they want and there will be no unfortunate consequences.\n\nTheir ideas mirror the Marxist, communist goals of total control. They want to end nationalism and place all power in one great political machine. They say that their plans will create a more fair society. They profess equity is a goal that we should all get behind. They believe that war will be no more, and all people of the world will share in the abundance of the earth.\n\nBeck lays out their plans chapter by chapter covering each area where change must occur. They believe that this “fundamental transformation” will create heaven on earth. They are taking on the mantel of God by assuming they can create a new man. They ignore the lessons of the past. They do not recognize that what they are working toward will simply be a form of fascism imposed by force.\n\nBeck ends with encouraging his readers to get more involved with what is going on in government, business, education, health care and large international institutions. He has a number of recommendations such as putting your money in small community banks or credit unions, finding the truth by going to original sources for information, and getting involved in local politics. He urges us to consider running for office or for school board or local city councils. He also recommends learning to communicate with others who have a different viewpoint and educating them in a way that doesn’t alienate them.\n\nI highly recommend reading The Great Reset to get a solid education in what is happening and how you can fight its evil goals.",
    "Small efforts, bring about great changes. No effort, no movement, nothing of consequence has ever been achieved, without many hands doing many small tasks. That's what this book is really about: disregarding the lie that you're too small to matter, and embracing the truth, that your small efforts, join with the efforts of others, and accomplish incredible things. That's how this nation was built; the concept of individual self rule, allowed to flourish, has had an astonishingly immense effect on the world. Because the scene of a parent teaching a child to honor the principles this nation was founded on, was repeated throughout the land. By the same token, the oligarchy that this nation is evolving into, has been accomplished by a small, but consequential, event repeated over decades. That event was the convincing of an individual to cede a little responsibility, and it's associated freedom, to some governing entity. Over and over, the citizens were convinced that, \"the government can take care of that for you,\" and they have away their freedoms and rights little by little, until ... well, until we are really in danger of being the last living Americans to know any degree of real freedom.\n\nI plead and pray that you read this book, and other books like it, and do just a little thing. Just a small thing. Talk to a friend. Learn about your neighbors, and who they are. Just little things. A paper plate of cookies, and a knock on a door. That's it. \"Hi. We live right there, and we realized that we don't have any idea who anybody living right on our street is. Anyway, we baked/bought/bought then baked these cookies, just to give us an excuse to introduce ourselves.\" I know that it sounds scary, but it really isn't, and maybe it could turn into a wonderful friendship. Or maybe your neighbors will simply know that the people living \"right there\" are slightly odd, but they are nice. And isn't it good to know that your neighbors are nice. Just that. That the folks living less than the toss of a ball from you, are nice people. Isn't that worth it? Isn't it really worth it, to simply do just a little more than nothing.",

    "This book, and Camus are both amazing. I read the stranger in High School and eventually I learned more about Camus on my own and became interested in his philosophy.\n\nReally good stuff in here that can be useful to secular and religious minded people. As for the people saying it's a hard read there's some truth to it but it's not quite as the reviews say.\n\nCamus talks about some fairly abstract concepts in this book but in his attempt at painting a accurate picture of what he's talking about, he basically uses every word in the English language.\n\nWords that I've never even seen till reading his book. But if you slow down look up some of the words and reference back to earlier pages that were building up to what he's saying on the current page it becomes fairly easy to understand what he's saying.\n\nSo I'd say it's more accurate to say it's a slow read that you might best approach with a few pages each day but if you're consistent enough it's not a hard book to get through just time consuming. It's no divine comedy level difficult, it's been translated into English pretty well.\n\nOther than that it's a great book for just navigating through life and finding a reason to go on, definitely something a young adult or older teen might really get some good use out of if they're into reading philosophy.\n\nThough I will add, read the stranger first, it really builds up the structure for the philosophical ideas he brings up in this book and will make reading this a lot easier.",
    "Philosophy gets real wordy and this book likes to do that, I like it tho, go push that boulder",
    "Na",
    "My favorite chapter of The Myth of Sisyphus is the first, in which Camus diagnoses the existential position of man in the cosmos as absurd. On the one hand we grasp for meaning, we grasp for knowledge, completeness, control. On the other hand, the universe defies our attempts at knowledge, meaning, completion and control. The gap between our sense-grasping nature and the senselessness of the world Camus dubs the Absurd. And, my two cents, he's pretty much right, and describes it pretty well.\n\nHis conclusions on what to do about it are a bit confused and come without much foundation though. I agree we should live with it, but the only argument he gives for that is because life is more full if we dare look it square in the face and don't deny the realities we're given. Sure, the absurd rules out objective values and an objective compass, but why does this mean that what Camus styles \"the most living\" all of a sudden is dictated?\n\nThe chapters on the Absurd Man, Absurd Creation and Sisyphus likewise fail to satisfy, though containing interesting discussions to varying degrees.\n\nIn summary, a good book for anyone who wants to come face to face with humanity's place in the world, a good book for anyone who needs to hear that there's no solution, a bad book for anyone interested in a sensible argument about what to do as we live without that solution.",
    "I'm not sure I ever really enjoyed Camus' voice, or perhaps it's his translator. However, something about his writing causes me to continue reading him.",

    "A foundational text for Absurdism, if you’re interested in the philosophical ideology you must read this book.\n\nNot a particularly long read, but an interesting one.\n\nCamus lays out what he calls the absurd and the options one has in life to deal with the absurdity.",

    "I bought this book because some are considering banning it from school reading. I am not a fan of banning, but am sure some books are not necessary reads for High school. This book is an inetresting look into the life of American slaves, hopefully done with lots of intense research. I retired from the school system so am extra interested. Loved the book, while I do feel it is a tough read because it skips timelines and the language is not \"bad\", but does reflect the times and the way slaves worded things. In my opinion, shouldn't be banned.",
    "Beloved by Toni Morrison is a dramatic historical fiction published in 1987 by Vintage Books. Morrison is an award-winning author of such prizes as the Nobel Prize in literature, the Pulitzer Prize, and many more. This novel was written with the purpose of exhibiting not only the horrors of slavery but also the psychological consequences it had on those who became free. Beloved adequately conveys these themes through the perspective of Sethe, a woman who was enslaved for most of her life and who tries desperately to run from her past once she achieves freedom. Reasons for Sethe’s grief include the mysterious death of her baby after whom the book was named as well as the everlasting feeling of repression that her owners instilled in her during her time on the plantation “Sweet Home” in Kentucky. Sethe’s issues also extend into her relationships. Her daughter, Denver, is constantly suspicious of new people who enter her mother’s life and constantly searches to learn more about her family’s history-a history her mother has worked desperately to forget. Sethe’s new lover, Paul D, who was also a slave at Sweet Home is extremely supportive of her strife. However, he cannot get her to forget about her true love Halle, who was separated from her when they left the plantation. Throughout the novel Beloved we as the readers see how Sethe evolves and accepts her past while more fragments of her past are explained.\nThe significance of the title Beloved is that this word was engraved on Sethe’s dead child’s tombstone. Throughout the book this significance becomes even more relevant. Many themes are present in this novel, though I feel the most important ones are running from the past and inferiority. From the early chapters of the book, it is clear that Sethe has faced some horrible situations including the death of her infant child and her abuse as a slave. The scars on Sethe’s back serve to symbolize the permanent effects that her past in slavery has on her present as a freed woman. The theme of inferiority is displayed many times throughout the book, but the character who faces this the most is Paul D. Paul D grew up with two half-brothers, both of which shared the same name Paul, but with an A and an F.\nTwo words I would use to describe Beloved are uncomfortable and confusing. Though these words have negative consequences, I believe this was Morrison’s intentions. I felt uncomfortable throughout the novel because of the excessive amounts of rape and because of some of Sethe’s decisions throughout some of the later chapters. Though these are unsettling events in the book, they are also very important to convey the atrocities that slaves were subject to. Of course, I could never imagine what it was truly like to be a slave, but I think Morrison accurately depicted the extreme physical and mental tolls slavery had on its victims. I also found Beloved to be very confusing because of its constant transition between Sethe’s time as a slave on the Sweet Home Plantation in Kentucky and her time as a freed slave in Cincinnati. This is not a criticism but simply encouragement to read the book a second time in order to develop a more thorough understanding. Morrison’s utilization of constant flashbacks served to add a level of suspense to Sethe’s life story.\nBeloved is an incredible depiction of life after slavery and the relationships one would make through it. I recommend this novel to people of all ages, but I feel like it is particularly important for white children to read. Slavery is a subject that is prevalent in every African American household even today, including many stories of the horrors their ancestors faced. Though I learned about slavery all through school, I was never able to put myself in the mind of a slave. For someone like me whose family never had to deal with any of it, it was especially mortifying. Beloved can be found on Amazon.com for $12.43 and free shipping with Amazon Prime.",
    "I selected Beloved as one of my #BannedBookWeek reads for September 2019. This isn't my first read by the G.O.A.T. Ms. Toni Morrison, it is my most recent read of hers in the personal growth journey I'm on. This wasn't a personal growth read, but it certainly does fit in that category for me.\n\nBrief Synopsis: Morrison sets out to show how deep the effects of slavery goes. Slavery, in some cases, was able to completely shatter the black family. Sethe's story is just one of the countless stories that are out there. While this is a work of fiction, it has ties to a true-story. Ms. Morrison gives voices to many people: mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, and brothers/sisters. The most important voice she writes for is that of the victim. So many times we focus on the justification of heinous acts and ignore the victim. I applaud her for this, because she did it so masterfully. While giving all these voices, she also gives a testament to the strength of the Black Woman even when such a woman doesn't realize it. The novel definitely tugs at your heart but that's what reality does. Will Sethe find her peace, what really happened, can a family survive after taking its freedom? Read this book to find out.\n\nI now speak on what spoke to my soul. I recently listened to a podcast by two talented black indie authors (Bookish Brown Girls). They chose to speak on Ms. Toni Morrison as we have lost the literary great that she will always be. In their podcast they relate quotes she said, their favorite works of art by her. One quote came from this book regarding love. Paul D. told Sethe her love was too thick. Her response was, \"Love is or it ain't. Thin love at love at all\"(Part 1, p. 194, par 1). It made me think about a mother's love and how deep it goes. Sometimes it's at a fault but with Sethe one thing she knew for sure, she was going to protect the only thing she had claim to in her eyes. While the slavery we read about no longer exists, the remnants of it does. I ask myself, how far will I go to protect my own? Reading this novel can make a person look at life from a different perspective. You may not agree with the message and that is your right. What is not your right, is to judge someone else's actions. Try walking in their shoes, your decision-making just might change.\n\nThe next idea that spoke to my soul I already mentioned in the synopsis, the strength of the Black Woman. Sethe, Denver, Baby Suggs, and even Beloved. All of them displayed varying degrees of strength. Looking at these woman helped me see both the strength I have and the strength I don't have. This is the main reason I view this book as a personal growth read. My vision of myself, me working to be the best version of me. Ms. Toni Morrison exposed another level of myself I didn't realize I felt or believed to be true. For this I thank her and know my path is becoming clearer.\n\nThe final idea that spoke to my soul was that of redemption. There were many characters who were looking for or even avoiding redemption. Sometimes it comes easily, most times it doesn't. This is because you have to be honest with yourself. This I believe is one of the hardest things to do in life. You can hide it from others, but you can't hide it from yourself. Your conscience won't allow it. I close this review with the question: Be honest with yourself, what redemption are you in search of?\n\nAs Always,\n#HappyReading\n\nTracey Robinson\nWords For The Soul Book Club",
    "It is a very interesting book reading.",
    "I purchased this book precisely because the Orange contingency of our nation BANNED it. I had never read any of Toni Morrison‘s books before the ‘book banners’ turned me on to her. Thank you! This is a deeply moving story of one woman’s struggle to live with the pain and anguish inflicted on her through the dehumanizing effects of slavery, and the difficulties of trying to assimilate into a ‘free’ society after slavery’s demise in the south. Perhaps if more people read this book we might all be more compassionate toward each other. But then again, that’s probably why the Orange contingency hates it so.",
    "This is an extremely powerful and, at times, troubling book. At the heart of the story is the returning spirit of a young woman who was murdered by her black slave mother in order to prevent her from ending up in the clutches of a slave owner. The relationship between mother and child is extremely conflicted; power rests with the returning child, I felt, because of the mother's guilt.\nAround this central theme are a number of close family members and slaves with common histories. All of the characters are portrayed with powerfully emotional lives that really made me, a white male in his 60s, get some sense of the tortured lives imposed on such individuals. I can only imagine the impact of this book on those with an African American heritage.\nThe book is not an easy read as the story is told in a non-linear fashion and through the eyes of multiple characters. This keeps the reader of their toes, but makes the story ultimately a more involving read.\nI can understand why this is considered a classic.",
    "Beloved by Toni Morrison 1931 - 2019. Book one in the Toni Morrison trilogy.\n\nAdmittedly It took me a bit of time to get into this book. Though once I got the gist of the lingo and the \"tongue\" in my head, it was a joy to read and difficult to put the book down.\n\nThe book is set in Cincinnati 1873 and the story is based Seethe, who is a runaway slave, trying to get herself, her children, friend's and husband to his mother's a free slave, where Seethe's cannat least raise her children in a free society and can offer sanctuary.\n\nThe story highlights the brutality of the slave in order to give luxury, lust and riches to the white man.\nWhat sacrifices, especially a slave mother would do to protect her children and highlight the discrimination and lynching even after slavery was abolished.\n\nIn this story, we follow Seethe, a slave, wife and a mother of four children battle to get all to the safety of her mother in law named Baby Suggs - freed by her owner Mr Garner and paid for by her Son, Halle, Seethe husband.\nLiving on a farm called sweet home, the owners Mr and Mrs Garner are kind and reasonable to the slave's they have. Until things change and another master comes to the farm with strict and brutal tactics, a plan is made by the slaves to escape to freedom.\n\nThe escape doesn't go to plan to everyone. Whitemen are patrolling to capture runaways. When Seethe see's them at Baby Suggs house and knows that no place is a safe and free place, she takes action to keep her babies safe and free from the pain and trauma a slave life brings, though when her baby dies, Seethe is haunted for the rest of her life.\n\nWhen Paul D, a fellow companion (slave) from sweet home tracks down Seethe many years later, he manages to banish the haunting, though Seethe free in body, is not free in spirit and mind and is still haunted by her past. However, Beloved turns up and Seethe, it seems, is able to put her demons to rest after the pain of bringing them to the surface.\n\nI loved the story, the writing style and use of language and description.\n\nReaching the end of the story, you do wonder if Beloved was everyone's haunting, a life lesson and a mutual understanding of the sacrifices made by Seethe. As Beloved seemed to open everyone's eye's, open up painful memories that still enslave Seethe and shackle her to the experience of being a slave. Or was Beloved plotting something else to punish Seethe further for allowing her to justify Seethe's actions. It's a very thought provoking story!\n\nToni Morrison has also written\n\nThe Bluest Eye\nSula\nSong of Solomon\nTar Baby\nBeloved #1\nJazz #2\nParadise #3\nLove\nA Mercy\nHome\nGod Help the Child",
    "The writing is just beautiful, so musical and evocative. Something of a ghost story and set against the previous slave history of the characters. As someone trying to educate herself in the light of recent events I found this book extremely enlightening. Gone With The Wind it ain’t. But the treatment of slaves by some of their masters beggars belief, which is not to say it’s untrue, but these people must be psychotic to treat another human being like this. One white character berated another for whipping his dog beyond endurance but whipping a slave doesn’t seem to fit into his code. As a white British reader I was horrified at the treatment of the women as sex objects but the slave men relieved themselves by using cows which was unjudged by the author. Arguably the white owners used the slave women no better. The detail of this was unknown to me so it’s important we hear people’s history. But the story is just beautiful and I loved it. It’s also worth remarking that not all the whites are villains, some do heroic work. However the author takes the view that they were still slave owners, and those that weren’t seem to be viewed as virtue signalling do gooders. In light of the early black experience in America I suppose such a cynical viewpoint is only to be expected.",
    "What a pleasure to read a great modern novel.\n\nThe American Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. Beloved, her fifth book, was inspired by a true story about a slave-mother in the mid-nineteenth century (called Sethe in the novel), who escaped across the river Ohio to the free city of Cincinnati, just before the Civil War.\n\nThere are four principal voices, about whom we learn as much from how they talk as what they say. There is a shocking central narrative, which darts back and forth in time like the unfolding of a shared trauma in group psychoanalytic sessions. The African-Americans who tell the story are profoundly instinctive and generally terrified of 'whitepeople', who are usually seen as non-human.\n\nOther characters are also brought to life, such as the slave-owner, 'Schoolteacher', or the old-timer and ex-slave, 'Stamp Paid'. Though she is not the pivotal character in the story, Sethe's daughter Denver became (for me) the anchor, as the most sympathetic and rounded person, who eventually frees herself from mental subjugation.\n\nGhosts are flesh and blood entities in Beloved. Sethe's daughter (called Beloved) reappears after many years, despite having been killed when an infant by her mother, who did not want her baby to be captured by a vicious slave-owner. This incident led to Sethe and her family being shunned by their community. As in South Africa under apartheid, oppression can lead not to solidarity amongst the oppressed but to fierce mutual suspicion. This feels more realistic than the somewhat simplistic characterisations in the Oscar-winning film, 12 Years A Slave.\n\nOccasionally the novel can be obscure. But this minor fault is massively outweighed by the imaginative writing which brings to life the hemmed-in and yet freely-roaming mindsets of the central characters.",
    "I read this book because it was listed in a recent television programme as “one of the most influential books of the 20th century”, and on its back cover as “… an American masterpiece”.\n\nSadly, and despite Toni Morrison’s undoubted pedigree – for she won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993 - I do agree with either of these epithets. Some might argue that as a [relatively] elderly white man I would be incapable of empathising with the book, but my criticisms are nothing to do with a lack of empathy but are more a feeling that the book is not worthy of being considered as a masterpiece, as the writing is often unconvincing and confusing and the narrative frequently distracts from the powerful underlying story.\n\nThe book, which was inspired by a true story, recounts the life of Sethe, who lived as a slave in Ohio in the second half of the 19th century; escaped via a desperate journey across the Ohio river; and came to live with her Grandmother Baby Suggs and her daughter Denver in a house called “124” in the free city of Cincinnati. The eponymous Beloved is the baby daughter whom Sethe killed because she didn’t want her to be taken away from her into a life of slavery; which led to Sethe being jailed (along with the baby Denver) and to her family being ostracised by their black community.\n\nThe book’s most impressive passages describe in compelling detail the impecunious day-to-day horrific and oppressed existence of black slaves in middle America in the 19th century; their terror of white people, who consider them to be unhuman; and the widespread racism then prevalent in the country, even after the American Civil War. The latter, of course, still has echoes in modern USA.\n\nAlthough the dialogue is written in the vernacular, it is credible and easily understood despite (or perhaps because of) the absence of grammar, syntax and so forth.\n\nThe story is told from various perspectives, sometimes from that of the [third person] author and sometimes from those of Sethe, Baby Suggs, Denver and other characters. This, coupled with the frequent time shifts and the fact that these are not described or signposted, meant that I often found myself wishing that the narrative had been written in a more straightforward manner.\n\nOne thing in particular that I actively disliked was the reappearance in number 124 of Beloved as a young woman, who becomes the dominant personality in the household, first as a silent presence and then as the seducer of Paul D, the itinerant black man who had become Sethe’s lover. For several chapters I was unsure whether this character was someone with the same name as Sethe’s murdered daughter, or (as it transpires) was a supernatural reincarnation of her. I found this plot device rather tedious and unhelpful."

    "Book came in great condition and arrived faster than expected",
    "I loved this book! A great read front to back, but something I will be picking up from time to time to find a random bit of wisdom when the mood hits. I definitely would read this through again, but it serves just as well as a daily thought exercise or pick-me-up.",
    "What makes Meditations an important book is that it provides the opportunity to discuss what it is to be human, to have a soul, to live a good life with one of the most remarkable men in history.\nBefore I get to that I want to second a suggestion made by several reviewers. Use two or more translations when you read the Meditations. I like this Penguin Classics edition. The introduction by Diskin Clay is useful, the translation by Martin Hammond is mostly accurate and his explanatory notes are very useful. There are some solid suggestions for further reading and several useful indices (of Names, of Quotations, and a General Index).\nMy one qualm about the translation is that Hammond sometimes makes the book sound a little Christian. Hammond will use \"sin\" where other translators (like Farquharson or Frances Hutchinson) would use \"impiety\" or \"harm\". This is decidedly not a Christian text. There is nothing in Marcus Aurelius (MA) of final judgment. There is no reward or punishment for our actions in this life. MA suspends judgments on all sorts of issues. It is clear that he believes in gods and occasionally talks about God (see 12.2). But he also mentions many times the alternative belief that all is chance and that death will be followed by oblivion. It is essential to his ethics however that death is not followed by any sort of hell.\nAlso worth thinking about is whether MA is a man whose philosophy is to be rejected (or, at least, radically modified) because it ultimately makes one less human. With MA, everything is to be thought through with the corrosive that is reason. We must not let our attachments cause us to lose sight of the truth.\nWe may kiss our children good night but we must remind ourselves as we are doing so that they could be dead tomorrow (11.34 in Meditations- this bit of choice advice came from Epictetus)!\nOne point about this is that there is a real conflict in MA with his idea that we should accept everything that the gods see fit to visit upon us (an idea expressed too many times to quote a single source) and his desire to not be effected by any of it. I would argue that true acceptance does not seek invulnerability. True confront embraces vulnerability and fully accepts the whole of our humanity. We have a choice about how we respond to our suffering. MA, at his best, is saying that and pointing out that we can not let our suffering control our actions. At his worst, he sometimes seems to be saying that we can chose not to feel our suffering. He is such a compelling writer that I think it is all too easy to read MA in a way that avoids how radical are some of his ideas.\nThe desire of MA for some sort of emotional invulnerability is part and parcel of his rejection of quotidian experience. He does not seem to have liked or admired many of his contemporaries and he does not seem fond of the simple pleasures of life. His descriptions of sexuality are always mingled with tones of disgust.\nWhere the Meditations may be most useful is when we are dealing with some sort of very extreme situation. There are two Naval Academy essays by John Stockdale about how he survived his imprisonment during the Vietnam War using the philosophy of Epictetus that delve into the full complexity of that philosophy. (These essays are referenced in the intro to the Penguin edition\nof Epictetus' writings. You can use the Amazon preview of that book to see the reference.)\nDoes all this mean that I think you should not immediately run out and buy a copy of this book? NO, NO, a thousand times, NO. The Meditations is one of those few books that everyone should read for help in working out their own philosophy. We all have to come to grips with how we want to live our own lives, what values we want to honor and MA is one of the writers who will help you work that out. He belongs in the company of St. Augustine, of Montaigne, of Machiavelli, of Plato, and of the Buddha (among many others- this list is mine own).\nSo, yes, read MA in the Hammond translation by all means. Remember that he wrote this book so that he would have constant and personal reminders to live up to his own philosophy. By reading this book, you may come to some understanding of what it would be like to live up to your own philosophy.",
    "I bought three translations of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations: Martin Hammond (Penguin Classics), Robin Hard (Oxford World's Classics), and Gregory Hays (Modern Library). Each has its merits, but I like Hammond's the best. What I particularly like about the Hammond edition, besides the piquant and muscular translation itself, are his erudite endnotes. These notes serve as a sort of concordance (tracing themes and threads running throughout the meditations) and commentary. Unlike others, Hammond isn't afraid to take the occasional critical eye toward the emperor: he notes Marcus' difficulties maintaining compassion and forbearance toward his fellow human beings, his contradictions, his indulgences, his obsessions, his very human hypocrisies and shortcomings. At the same time, Hammond avoid vulgar cynicism and doesn't shy away from expressing admiration for Marcus' many moments of poetic beauty, eloquence, and humility.\n\nWhat emerges is not the lionized \"philosopher king\" (ala Plato's Republic), the idealized paragon of Stoic virtue he has become in the public imagination (I like to call this reductionist version of Stoicism \"Bro-icism\"), but rather a human being struggling everyday to apply rigorous philosophical injunctions to his wayward, often frustratingly recalcitrant humanity and to use that philosophy to assuage his anxieties about public life and the inevitability of death. The Meditations are a rare document, thus, because it preserves the candid struggles of a fallible human being to apply a school of philosophy to his life, rather than the perfected rhetoric and polished dialectic of philosophical treatises.\n\nHays' translation may be more accessible and Hard's is occasionally more beautiful, but Hammond's is the one I feel most accurately represents the contents of this unusual artifact of noble ambition, strife, and suffering. It is the most human of the three, in my opinion.",
    "Classic book and it’s a penguin edition. Must read for anyone interested in this subject. I highly recommend it cause it’s a penguin edition.",
    "Book arrived in good condition no problem\nFound in the pages.",
    "I like this book",
    "I did my best to read this book slowly, but I feel like I still didn’t read it slowly enough to get everything out of it. Probably it’s best to just read a meditation or two a day and to think long on them yourself, but that’s not going to happen in the real world. Originally written as notes by Marcus Aurelius to himself, it seems one can still find a lot to apply to one’s own non-emperor of Rome life in these nearly 2,000 year old meditations. Admittedly, I wasn’t as blown away as I thought I might be, finally reading through these after hearing how tremendously influential and inspiring others have found these writings through the centuries. It seems a lot of the pieces cover the same ground, just slightly re-worded… so sometimes reading these notes as a book does feel a bit repetitive. Also some pieces that try to describe the nature of the world as perfect, or the god’s perfection, just read off from a more modern perspective (or anyway from my 2020 perspective, which could be wrong, I guess). The most useful ideas I’m keeping in mind from this were the meditations on staying calm, not letting yourself get angry at other’s actions, being kind and trying to do good, and the idea that the years before you were born are endless and the years after you are dead are endless and the universe is huge, thus our time and life is tiny, so don’t get so worked up about it.",
    "I thought I had made a mistake upon reading several negative reviews and was very relieved to find that the negative reviews belonged to a different translation.\n\nThis Penguin Classics translation by Martin Hammond is very good.",
    "This book was my introduction to Stoicism and my first philosophical book in general. Compared to books I read afterwards, this book is easy to read, seeing as it is mostly written in standalone paragraphs. The detailed notes that accompany most of these paragraphs do indeed help in better understanding both the context in which the book was written and the ideas themselves.\n\nAs far as being \"able to change your mindset\" is concerned, I believe that the ideas written here can influence the outlook on many aspects of one's life, especially if they are already thinking along similar lines.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about Stoicism, this is a great place to start.",
    "A very deep thought provoking book. Consisting of 12 short books on the principles and philosophies of living a good life, acknowledging the present moment, looking within and being of good virtue. Precise and razor sharp with its principles on purposeful action and thought. This book has changed my views on life, the way I view people, problems, joy, pain, and situations. It has taught me patience, resilience and the power of indifference. A question I often ask myself is: Am I offended by the \"thing\" that happened to me or my judgement of the \"thing\" that happened to me? One of the many questions you will begin to ask yourself after reading this book.\n\nOften times its our judgements about things that cause us pain and distress. Remove the judgement and you are no longer harmed. Remove the thought \"I am hurt\" and the hurt itself is removed. Very difficult to implement but once you start you will see how much life is about adjusting how your 'directing mind' views things.\n\nThis book touches greatly on being of good virtue which comes down to your character and mindset. These are one of, if not the most immeasurable traits you have and you must refine them constantly in your pursuit of arete.\n\nI could go on and on about this book but I only have so much characters for this short review.\n\nVery insightful read and worth it. So many life lessons, wisdom, practical guidance and knowledge to be used in everyday life. You won't be disappointed with this timeless classic.",
    "Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor, but today he is best remembered for this book, and although not originally meant for publication or circulated amongst all and sundry, the Fates had different ideas, and so over the proceeding centuries this has become of use and an inspiration to many. Although he would have spoken and written in Latin, for the pieces that make up this book he instead turned to the classical language of philosophers at the time, Greek.\n\nAnd so we are presented in modern English in this Penguin classics edition with what is called the twelve books that make up this work. Some of the pieces here are only a sentence long, whilst others are a paragraph or so long, and all show the workings and thrust of Aurelius’ mind and what he wanted to achieve. Notes as such in a certain sense, as well as ruminations, so the emperor used this to work out his thoughts and ideas on numerous subjects, thus meditating on life, its meaning and so on. As a work then this falls into the stoic camp and is actually quite spiritual in places, which will even please those of a religious mind. As we are reminded life is fleeting and our existence on the Earth is only a blink of an eye in the time of the universe, and thus the author looks upon our time here, what and how we should live to be our best, and how to be at peace with not only ourselves, but those around us.\n\nThis is of course something to aspire to and if you know the history of the period, then you will know that there was warring between the Roman legions and those surrounding them, usually called barbarians. Reading this book then does give you a feeling of calm as you read what inspired and what meant most to Marcus Aurelius and does help you to centre yourself and find what is important to you. There are footnotes and so on here, but especially if you have never read this before (and even if you have) then the introductory pieces are well worth a read. This book should be a must have for any leader, and if perhaps all the world’s leaders read this, understood and applied some of it there would be a lot less strife going on.",
    "I was nervous before reading this book. I have done some light reading on stoicism and watched videos on Youtube and it had become clear that this book was a must read for. The expectations had built up and I was worried that it might be a case of don't meet your heroes. Fortunately I couldn't have been more wrong as the tales of being emperor of antiquities most revered society infused with such wisdom was fascinating"

    "Colditz Castle is an immense fortress in eastern Germany, for centuries a place of both refuge and imprisonment for a wide variety of inhabitants. During World War II it became a holding pen for the most incorrigible trouble makers as well as some of the most prominent or well-connected among the Allied prisoners. Tales of what happened inside Colditz during those years began to spread even before the war ended, and in the eighty years since those stories have assumed the stuff of myths and legends. Ben Macintyre has written a comprehensive history of the men who spent the war years inside Colditz, both as prisoners and as guards, that makes for an absolutely unput-downable read.\n\nWhen we read spy novels and memoirs or watch James Bond films we often find the tales of incredible escapes, intricate devices, and raw courage almost unbelievable. Prisoners of the Castle has plenty of such tales that make anything Ian Fleming wrote seem tame in contrast. As you read, you'll be overawed by the determination and character displayed by men like Airey Neave, Douglas Bader, Birendranath Mazumbar, Florimond Duke, and Michael Sinclair, among many others. You'll be just as impressed with many of the German officers like Reinhold Eggers, as well as with the multitude of others from outside Colditz who assisted the captives there, such as Irma Wernicke, Lee Carson, and Jane Walker.\n\nI'm always glad to see a new Ben Macintyre book on sale. He always tells fascinating stories that are meticulously documented, filled with amazing anecdotes and incredible feats. Prisoners of the Castle is one of his best works, ranking alongside Operation Mincemeat, Agent Zigzag, and Double Cross. Buy it, but make sure you have plenty of reading time available, because you will not want to put Prisoners of the Castle down.",
    "Another brilliant book by Ben Macintyre, one of my favorite authors. I have read seven books by Macintyre, of which Agent Sonya is my personal favorite. This most recent book is on a par with his normal, excellent work. He is one of the best non fiction authors who deal with espionage related issues and characters.\n\nI was surprised to see the extent to which British \"class\" based society survived captivity under the Nazis. All the officers were assigned valets, from the enlisted ranks.\n\nMacintyre portrays characters on both sides of the war. One of the most compelling characters is Reinhold Eggers, whose job seemed to be prisoner warden, although the term was not used. And Douglas Bader, a legless RAF pilot, regarded in his time as one of the RAF's great heroes, comes off in this book as a complete ass. He even vetoed a prisoner exchange that would have allowed his valet to be released.\n\nHighly recommended. If you like WWII non fiction, or prison narratives, or almost any of Macintyre's earlier work, you will enjoy this.",
    "I’ve read all of Macintyre’s books, but this is probably his best. Absolutely gripping. Although I was aware (or thought I was aware) of what went on in Colditz, this was eye-opening.\n\nLet’s just say that of all the most interesting characters in the prison, David Stirling, founder of the SAS, and Douglas Bader, the legless air ace, are not even the most fascinating! In my opinion, that would be Micky Burn. A commando, poet, dramatist, novelist (he actually wrote a novel during his captivity), and former Nazi supporter turned communist supporter. Before the war, he met Hitler, who gave him a signed copy of “Mein Kampf”! Oh, and he was bisexual, at a time when homosexuality was, literally, a crime in Britain. He deserves a book all to himself.\n\nThe final chapter, which summarizes the later lives of all the characters, is especially poignant.\n\nNow, let’s hope that the BBC and HBO will get together and turn this into a miniseries.",
    "Macintrye provides a very well researched and written account of the experiences of Allied officers and soldiers imprisonment in Colditz Castle during WW2. Th\ndaring escapes, attempts to escapes, the loneliness and their efforts to combat the loneliness. The \"cast\" of legendary figures are presented in narrative form. I highly recommend this outstanding read.",
    "…as his previous books, which read like a novel.",
    "Macintyre's latest work is a departure from the basic historical narrative that is the more familiar telling of the story of Oflag IVC, Colditz Castle. The clue is in the title, the focus is on the experience of the prisoners. Was it really as gung-ho and Boys' Own as previous works have suggested it was? What was the human context for the bravery and ingenuity of the Allied Prisoners Of War? What forces of psychology, politics, class, race, sexuality and mental illness were at play there, between the prisoners themselves and between the incarcerated and incarcerators? Commendably, Macintyre has attempted to answer these questions, whilst at the same time presenting a readable and entertaining book.\n\nBut, and there's always a but, it merely skims the surface, skates over the inner courtyard cobblestones. He leads us in, gives us a glimpse and then draws us back. Names are omitted that are identified elsewhere; like the majority of the tunnels under the place, leads are opened that end up nowhere or just simply dead-ended. Excellent points are made yet are left undeveloped. I want to know more. He says that the mood of the prisoners unaccountably shifted, from ebullience and purposefulness to immense sadness and lethargy. But there is no exploration of what that was like: how did it manifest; how did it feel; what did people do? There is what it was, but not the lived experience of what it was. There should be more given the amount of material available now, including taped archives, official archives, private papers, published and unpublished memoirs and reminiscences.\n\nWhilst accessible and readable, I found the authorial tone bland and unengaging. The story of the lived experience of prisoners and guards is powerful stuff, but it needs to be told well to make that power tangible and moving for the reader. I want to laugh, shed a tear, be amazed and appalled as well as informed. Information was conveyed. That is all.\n\nI'm glad this book is out there, and I hope it leads to a better book. It's been 20 years since Henry Chancellor's definitive tome, it's time for a fresh and similarly comprehensive examination, one that explores the nooks and crannies that made up the lives of those who served there, that dives deep into the tunnels of their experiences and clambers over the rooftops of insight and perception: a book that delivers on the intentions of this one. If this book was an escape attempt, it made it out of the castle, but was captured after a few days out.",

    "I have the Kindle version. Every apostrophe and quotation mark in this text has been replaced with all sorts of messy symbols, such as €€™â and more. It makes the text very hard to read in certain sections.\n\nThe content of the book itself is amazing though. Highly recommend reading it but maybe get the printed version unless they fix this with an update.",
    "The manual was comprehensive and gives details from the founder of EMDR which will be extremely helpful in my practice and as an adjunct resource for my Course in EMDR.",
    "The third edition has been some time in coming - since the second in 2001, we've seen ongoing research into EMDR as a psychotherapy and fascinating studies of the eye movements Shapiro posited as facilitating a neurological processing of unresolved experiences, more international and national agencies evaluating that research and determining EMDR is an effective therapy in the treatment of psychological trauma, and the continuous exploration of EMDR's with other conditions. Yet the fundamental principles, protocols and procedures remain largely unchanged - given EMDR's success before the presentation of the Second Edition, there is no surprise in this. What the Third Edition brings is more: more clarity, more experience, more research, more applications, and, the continuous thread from the beginning, more compassion. Clinicians familiar with the earlier editions will find that \"more\" amplifying and clarifying their use of EMDR and providing a solid, well established center to their work. Shapiro's continuous insistence on empiricism, a position she still maintains, resulted in stability through the sometimes rough rapids of a paradigm shift in psychotherapy and this volume is the best expression of that shift. For clinicians just coming across EMDR and wondering what this is all about, maintain a healthy skepticism, read the book and get trained in the methodology, and try it with your clients. For these clinicians, \"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\" (3rd. ed.) maintains what was best in the first two editions - an invitation to learn this powerful therapy, one that makes use of their clients' own ability to heal.",
    "...and this book is a roadmap to this better life, where we ourselves, our children, our parents, our siblings... and even our pets are happier. EMDS makes it possible because when we change for the better we make life better for everyone around us. I love the book and I am forever grateful to the author. I am already experiencing change and wish everyone could understand how much they would benefit from EMDR.",
    "This book is super comprehensive and helpful. It explains step by step every phase of the process with detailed information about each step. Highly recommend it!",
    "I am a certified EMDR therapist, consultant and facilitator of basic training's for EMDR therapy. I have all 3 editions of Francine Shapiro's books which I ordered from Amazon. I bought this book to read the new additions to her book and to stay up to date with her new findings. I would recommend any practicing clinician to read this book and take the EMDR basic training, it will change your practice and help your patients in profound and significant ways. Client/patients are often baffled by the effectiveness of this treatment especially when they have been treated with other therapies in the past that only brought temporary relief to their symptoms. I've heard multiple times from recipients of this therapy, that it has changed their life in significant ways, \"the memory is there, but the disturbance is gone\" is a recent expression from a client of mine. I would recommend this book to any psychologist, doctor, nurse, graduate student or counselor, and take the EMDR training- your life as a treatment provider will forever change.",

    "This is not the party of Ronald Reagan, he would have no place in it. Their war with the Democratic party began in 1994 when Newt Gingrich became speaker of the house with a new group of house members started the Republican revolution and started the party's path to lies,misinformation, deception and their tie with militant groups. The Karl Rove and Bush-Cheney era and Mitch McConnel. Donald Trump was the monster that the GOP created 25 years ago. This is a must read for those that want to know the truth of what happened to this party. The author gives a very good accounting.",
    "Milbank has always been a sharp and funny observer of the political scene. In this book he outdoes himself. This book is a painful, often infuriating read, but an important one, necessary and clarifying. Milbank’s best move is quickly setting up a situation and then letting the culprits speak for themselves. In deftly chosen quotes, his subjects – from Gingrich to McConnell, Karl Rove to Roger Stone – invariably indict themselves, proving over and over again Milbank’s thesis that the dirty tricks, bad faith and often jaw-dropping malfeasance of contemporary Republicans, culminating in Trump, go back at least 25 years to the merciless tactics employed by Gingrich in support of his so-called “Republican Revolution” in 1994. As Milbank puts it with devastating directness, “The rise of Gingrich and his shock troops fundamentally altered American government for a generation and counting, and set the United States on a course toward the ruinous politics of today.” What follows is autopsy after autopsy of the many destructive plots hatched by Republican politicians and their operatives, all singularly aimed to achieve and perpetuate power rather than to effectively govern the country. Milbank demonstrates as well as any commentator how the shocking rise of Trump was actually an inevitable apotheosis of a plunge to the amoral, unethical bottom that Gingrich pioneered and his successors perfected. Along the way, as Milbank makes painfully clear, we’ve lost a functioning democracy as well as the hope of working together, the tragedy of our time.",
    "I found this a difficult book to read because it shows how successful the republican party has been in destroying facts, reality, and our democratic foundation in order to move us towards an authoritarian minority rule nation. It was interesting to add up the number of related events through the decades since the onset of Newt Gingrich in 1994, that have been driven by lies, conspiracy theories, slander, and violence ,or at least threatening it. Trump is truly a symptom of an underlying national decay that panders to the absolute lowest base instincts of human nature. Frankly, the book is harrowing and fatalistic in leading the reader to assume that the fix is in and our democracy in at least the near future is doomed. While we tried to \"go high,\" it seemed only to embolden the worst among us that going \"low\" was the path to their success.",
    "I enjoyed it because it's completely accurate and factual. Republican voters as well as their fair harebrained star have become one big prime time soap opera. The Moonies are back and yes, Donald Trump was a big fan of Sun Myung Moon.",
    "If this true genius could just take the great, insightful book back a couple of decades, our country might not be riding out this slow motion democracy wreck. Might have actually done regularly what we must do for nothing less than 2 presidential election cycles: vote anything but Republican. Please read this book.",
    "This deeply researched, thoroughly documented, and well written book provides the historical antecedents to the events of January 6, 2021 and to the many causes for the threats to democracy that exist in autumn, 2022. The author, a veteran journalist and writer for the Washington Post, is well positioned to write this history as he has had a front row seat to the legislative, judicial, and executive branch decisions that have fomented discord and an ecosystem of intolerance that is unique in American history.\n\nThis book ought to be required reading for all high school seniors as it helps to explain important political and social events of the past 25 or so years and connects the dots to show how statements made in 1995 inflamed tensions that led to the Big Lie and to attempts to overthrow the Biden victory in the 2020 election.\n\nOf great interest to all who love freedom and democracy and who believe that personal and political integrity are essential to the future of the republic.\n\nHighly recommended.",
    "Dana Milbank has written an extremely painful, incredibly well-documented, stinging history of the last 25 years of the Republican party. My grandfather's grandfather was a delegate for Lincoln in 1860. Long family history in the Republican party. But even my father, once the head of the Republican party of Northeast Ohio, was voting Democratic before his death in 2013.\n\nThis has all been a long time coming. Trump is the result, not the cause of the demise of the former Republican party, as it searches endlessly for the bottom of the policy-free, agenda-free, national platform-free, fear mongering, intolerant, ignorant political pit that is its current incarnation.\n\nTom Taft",
    "Don't be afraid that I called this book a history book. It's not boring history. Dana Milbank gives the reader the history of the republican party through the late 60s to today. He wrote the feelings, experiences that\nAmericans were and are living in. Read the history of the US in a post Lyndon Johnson Great Society world\nthat passed Medicare, Civil rights, Voting rights then came Women's Rights, LGBTQ rights which Republicans\nwere against then and now. Read this book."

    "The other day, someone shared a \"tweet\" with me, tagged \"DadsTalking,\" in which a father remarks, \"I love my son's curiosity & spirit, ...but he always comments and talks back. How do I get him to stop without stifling him?\" This simple tweet, marked by its earnestness, angst and apprehension, concisely encapsulates American attitudes toward parenting today. In her book Bringing up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting, Pamela Druckerman, a former journalist and American expatriate living in Paris, seeks to juxtapose American and French parenting methods. Druckerman argues that while American parents often admit that kids need limits, \"...in practice, we're often unsure where these limits should be or we're uncomfortable policing them\" (224). Part memoir, part cultural analysis, part childrearing manual, this book argues that while American parenting methods are likely to produce entitled, disobedient, and impetuous \"Dylans\" and \"Isabellas,\" French parenting methods are likely to produce respectful, well-behaved and disciplined \"Pierres\" and \"Paulettes.\" And on top of this, French mothers are less haggard, less sleep-deprived and more confident than American mothers. Bringing Up Bebe explores the reasons behind this discrepancy and presents a French alternative to the neurotic, guilt-ridden and vacillating American way.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that more than a few American mothers dislike this book. (Elaine Sciolino's review in The New York Times is less than glowing). Some reviewers criticize Druckerman for what they perceive to be an over-generalized misrepresentation of American mothers. Druckerman is clear about the fact that she is comparing college-educated, white, middle-to-upper-middle class American parents, particularly those who are also urban, to college-educated, white, middle-to-upper-middle class Parisian parents. Of course we all know American parents in this demographic who don't quite fit the mold she describes, but, based on my own personal reading, as well as my teaching and parenting experiences, I found her assessments to be quite accurate and very often convicting.\n\nI'm giving this book five stars, not because I felt a great affinity for the author while reading (especially not after I learned from a different source what she got her husband for his fortieth birthday!) and not because I agreed with every French parenting precept I found in the book. I'm giving it five stars because I loved every second of reading it, I couldn't stop talking about it over dinner with my husband, I felt compelled to write in the margins of pretty much every page, I'm already seeing the fruit of its application to my life, I want to share it with my friends - and not just those who are moms, and, most importantly, because this is the first secular resource on parenting that has not made me feel plagued with anxiety. It didn't make me feel guilty for preferring sleep schedules to co-sleeping, infant seats and playpens to habitual baby-wearing and the \"cry-it-out\" method to long, sleepless nights, perforated by several nursing sessions. This book confirmed what I've always believed to be true about wise parenting and served as a corrective against the areas in which I am too insecure to follow through on my resolves. And it made me laugh and feel good while I was at it.\n\nThat being said, the ideas presented in the book are not exactly novel. I often associate Parisian women with French feminism, student protests, casual sex and aversion to religion - certainly not with traditional family structures and parenting methods. And yet, French parenting is at odds with contemporary American parenting because it rejects our progressive, child-centered, self-esteem-enhancing methods. French parenting is relatively traditional, parent-centered and authoritative. In fact, much of what I read in Bringing Up Bebe sounded very similar to what I've read from evangelical Christian author Gary Ezzo, creator of the infamous and widely disputed Babywise series. Both insist that the home be parent-and not child- centered, meaning that parents, not children, establish the family's rhythm. Both see prolonged \"nursing on demand,\" as entirely untenable, and advocate, instead, regular feeding schedules. Both promise to have an infant sleeping through the night by two months of age, even if it involves resorting to the much maligned \"cry it out\" method. (Although, Druckeman euphemistically calls the French version of the CIO method \"Le Pause,\" the two are essentially the same: don't pick the baby up the instant he cries, but instead assess the situation and see if he might simply be trying to settle himself down to rest; be willing to let a toddler cry at night in his crib for longer periods of time if he is refusing to sleep.) Both stress that the mother and father's relationship to one another not be sacrificed, willingly or unwillingly, to the demands of childrearing but, instead, be nourished and tended to, even if this involves setting early bedtimes for kids, establishing clear rules for mealtimes and encouraging more independent play. Both view firm and consistent discipline in a child's life as something that makes him ultimately content in his own skin and prepared for real-life challenges; it's okay for a parent to say \"no\" and \"it's me who decides.\" Both encourage parents to be sensitive to a child's needs. And both promise that these principles not only make life easier for the parents, but serve a child's best interests as well.\n\nOf course these methods will sound a lot more attractive to the world coming from a sophisticated, svelte Parisian woman in designer jeans than from Evangelical Ezzo. Anti-Ezzo message boards are peppered with comments like \"dangerous and manipulative,\" and \"this book should be burned\" and (my favorite), \"It makes me SICK that they are there convincing innocent new parents how to 'raise' their children, when their own children do not even talk to them!\" It's hard to imagine anyone saying such uncharitable things about the lovely Monique, Samine and Laurence. It's also worth noting that the values and presuppositions driving these strategies are undoubtedly different for Ezzo than I would imagine they are for most French parents. (The desire to eat smelly cheese sans interruptions from whining children probably propels much of the traditional parenting styles in France - not a firm conviction in the doctrine of original sin...) But, regardless of motivation, the parenting techniques outlined by conservative, evangelical-types share striking similarities with those of the Parisians Druckerman profiles- much to my surprise! It's not every day that \"evangelical\" and \"French\" go in the same sentence!\n\nWhile I was astonished by these similarities, Bringing Up Bebe outlines a number of distinctly French approaches to parenting, most of which are an absolute pleasure to read about. (According to Druckerman, Rousseau and French psychoanalyst Francoise Dolto are responsible for indelibly shaping French attitudes toward childrearing.) Where Gary Ezzo tends to be overly dogmatic and rigid, the French parents Druckenman observes are wonderfully nuanced, strategic and sensitive, all while maintaining their high expectations for behavior. For example, I very much prefer the French method of refining a child's palette (\"You may be excused after you try at least one bite of every dish on your plate\") to Ezzo's legalistic one (\"You will stay in your highchair until that plate is licked clean!\"). I loved the French idea of cadre - that is, building a firm framework of boundaries for a child's behavior and then giving him the freedom to move about unrestricted within those boundaries. French parents also have a wonderful category for behaviors that are perhaps mildly annoying and naughty but not worth fighting battles over. These minor infractions, over which both parents and children are meant to chuckle, are called les betises by both parents and children. (Druckerman considers a betise to be something akin to saying caca boudin, that is, \"poop sausage.\" ) And lastly, I love that French parents tell their children to \"be wise,\" instead of knocking them over the head with the overused \"be good,\" and I love that they give children a firm attend! (wait) when they want them to be quiet or be patient.\n\nIt's this concept of attend! that I have found difficult to enforce as the mother of a toddler. While I've accepted that my daughter go through a brief stage of crying in her crib at night so we can all benefit from consistent sleep, I find that my resolve is a lot weaker in the face of daytime crying, which typically occurs about thirty minutes before dinner. As a result, I often find myself bouncing a toddler on my hip while trying to dodge splatterings of oil from whatever I am cooking on stovetop. The French mothers in Bringing Up Bebe and their conviction that a mother must not capitulate to the whims and fancies of a child when she has pressing domestic duties to accomplish, both for the mother's sanity and the child's good, have inspired me to reevaluate my current approach to pre-dinner mayhem. The French way is as simple as this: When I'm cooking and my daughter beckons for me to pick her up, I bend down, calmly explain that she has to wait, confident that she understands every word I am saying, and then resume dinner preparation, without feeling guilty. She usually clamors at my legs for a moment, and then toddles off to find something else to do, and within minutes, I usually hear her happily singing or babbling to herself. Upon observing this the other day, my husband exclaims, \"I like the new French you!\" while giving me a side-hug. His expression sobers as he considers the French predilection for extramarital affairs, and he adds, \"Now, just don't become all French in our marriage.\"",
    "I loved this book. I already use many of these parenting techniques with my own bebe (before even reading this book) because they seemed like common sense to me. They work every time. My girl was \"doing her nights\" at 2 1/2 months. She is now 6 months old and she sleeps 12 hours a night before waking up, and she naps 3 or 4 times a day. Even when I used to babysit other people's kids I used many of these techniques, especially \"the big eyes\". I have always firmly believed in the cadre, and also that kids will eat foods that they are introduced to, if parents go about it the right way. I also believe that America has been taken over by enfant rois that need to be coddled and told how amazing they are for the most mediocre achievements, and they end up never doing anything with their lives that is worthwhile.\n\nAside from the parenting techniques to teach children how to be sage, I also found helpful the parts about how almost guilt-free the moms are. I have found myself feeling guilty about a lot of things, especially the things that are beyond my control. Now I realize that I don't have to feel guilty for needing time apart from my little one, because she probably needs time apart from me too! And I don't have to feel guilty about wanting to combine my roles as wife, mother, and worker into one whole person: a woman with needs and feelings. I like that the French believe that children should learn their place in the home, and that its not all about them all the time. I think this teaches children responsibility and empathy for others.\n\n-----------\n\nI am editing my review to include some info now that my bebe is almost 18 months old. I've since read Karen Lebillion's book, French Kids Eat Everything and started using that to help me teach my daughter to appreciate meals and foods. So far everything is going great and I regret nothing. I only wish that these books had been available when I was pregnant since I didn't get to read them until my bebe was an infant and I had less time to read each day. For these books, I MADE the time. Even if it meant less sleep at night.\n\nMy personal parenting style includes some Attachment Parenting ideals, and a lot of what is in BUB and FKEE. It is working for me and my family and we are happy. My husband is happy to have a sweet and cheerful toddler who is a joy to be around. I am happy to feel good about being woman with a family, not just a mom and a wife. My daughter is happy because she gets the attention she needs and deserves, the sleep and nutrition she requires, and is learning and enjoying life in all its lovely variety.\n\nHere's how things have changed since my initial review:\n\nImplementing a \"French\" parenting style is much different with a toddler than it is with an infant. Its harder because sometimes during tantrums you just want to give in and let them have whatever they want, especially if you are in a public place and getting nasty looks. But 99% of the time I am able to stay strong. I remind myself that when she is throwing a fit, she may want a snack or a new toy. But what she needs is to learn patience and good manners. If I don't teach her, how will she learn? If she doesn't learn by practice, then how?\n\nI won't say my daughter is the best behaved child of all time. She goes to a daycare which is a lot like a creche in some ways, but that is where the similarities end. There is only one teacher per 7-8 children. Not nearly enough to prevent all the biting, hitting, kicking, etc that goes on among toddlers. My daughter has learned some pretty awful words and aggressive behaviors from other kids that she would never have learned in our home. This is natural and would have happened eventually once she reached school age, but I was not ready for this from a toddler. Luckily at home we are able to stop these behaviors quickly.\n\nShe has a lot of toys, thanks to her relatives. She doesn't play with most of them because she prefers \"real\" things and we believe in unstructured play. She uses her toys in creative ways I would never have thought of. We try to only give her toys which will encourage creativity. We also like to take her places that she can explore on her own. Out to fields, to museums, parks, nature paths, etc. Not just places that are themed for children. We like to just let her play on her own as much as she wants. When she wants us to play with her she comes to us and asks, but we stay out of her way until she asks us to join her. Her favorite thing to do is read. She likes us to read to her and she also likes to \"read\" to her animals and dolls. She basically turns the pages and babbles and points to the pictures. Thanks to teaching her to be patient she is happy to sit still and read several books at one time. Her favorite book is almost 70 pages long. She also likes to \"give speeches\" where she lines up her toys and she stands in front of them and talks to them and gestures wildly like she's giving a passionate speech about something super important. I have no idea where she learned that. Her pediatrician says her vocabulary, behaviors, and level of self control is far beyond her age group. I don't know how much of that is due to my parenting or what but I'm proud.\n\nAs a result of using BUB and FKEE to drastically alter our eating habits, my daughter eats a ton of different foods that most of the kids I know would gag on. Her favorite foods include black olives and raw broccoli. She also is more well behaved in restaurants than she is at home. She sits and waits for her food, and she at least tries everything on her plate. She doesn't always eat everything but she doesn't throw her food (anymore...) and she doesn't have fits at the table. She sits still and talks to me and her dad while we finish eating and pay. At home she gets a little restless since she knows her toys are in another room and she wants to get up from the table and go play instead of waiting for me and my husband to finish eating. She hasn't learned to politely excuse herself from the meal yet, so until she does we make her sit with us until everyone has finished.\n\nWe get compliments all the time from people in public who see her on her best behavior. Some of her first words were please and thank you. She is friendly and says hello and goodbye to everyone we meet. She says thank you to anyone who gives her anything and rarely has to be reminded to say please. She usually does not freak out in public unless I've kept her out too long and she's tired or hungry. I can pretty much take her anywhere with me without any problems.\n\nBUB is perfect for me because I don't believe in spanking. I don't think there is any reason to spank ever. I give my child the tools she needs to learn to behave herself. Spanking teaches nothing except to do what the parent says in order to not get spankings. I want to teach her to have good manners and follow instructions because its the right thing to do. I feel that I have the ability to teach her right from wrong, and the reasons why she should behave a certain way. I feel that she is intelligent enough to understand these concepts. Spanking her would represent a lack of confidence in my ability to teach her and in her ability to learn. With the things I've learned in BUB, I won't ever feel like I need to spank her. I do believe in short time outs and in taking away privileges and things, because those are real consequences and they have meanings behind them. Spanking is just senseless violence and teaches nothing but more violence in the place of knowledge. So far we've never spanked and we don't think she is old enough for time out, and we also haven't needed it. She knows what's allowed and what's not. Toys that are kicked, thrown, or otherwise abused are temporarily taken away. Food that is thrown is taken away. When crayons are used to color things that are not paper, they are taken away. When she demonstrates the ability to follow rules and control herself again, she has earned back whatever was taken away. So simple, easy, and effective.\n\nOur relatives thought I was nuts in the beginning, but now after having seen the effects BUB and FKEE have had on our family they are recommending them to everyone with kids.\n\nI couldn't be happier with this book and how its impacted us.",
    "I did enjoy this and found it an interesting set of observations on French child-rearing. However, there was a bit too much of the New York Francophile for me - it made you feel as though Americans never do anything right and the French never do anything wrong which could get annoying.",

    "This is the first novel I have read by Morrison, but I was aware of her iconic status as a writer before reading The Bluest Eye. Prior to reading this book, I read and was thoroughly impressed by “Red at the Bone” by Woodson. Woodson wrote that she was influenced and inspired by Morrison, which is primarily what led me to The Bluest Eye.\n\nMorrison’s legendary reputation is well earned. Her writing is superb and original. If someone gave me an excerpt written by Morrison, likely I could guess the author. Her writing is rich in description and raw truth. She does not placate or sugar coat. Morrison instead shocks and assaults the reader by shining a spotlight on the harsh truth. The Bluest Eye is uncomfortable, thought provoking and powerful.\n\nIf you are considering reading The Bluest Eye, be aware there are some potentially triggering themes, including: incest, child molestation, one of the characters is a child predator, and some of the characters are sex workers.\n\nThe major theme throughout the novel are the effects of pressure on women and young girls to conform to cultural and societal standards of beauty. Using a multi-generational storyline and a cast of female characters, Morrison challenges readers to think about where women get their sense of value and worth, and how that is impacted by the standards of beauty that are programmed into all of society. Morrison assumes the bitter truth that meeting societal standards of beauty results in better treatment and a higher social status. The story tackles how women’s lives are negatively affected if they cannot meet the beauty standard (such as having blue eyes, hence the novel’s title). In short, this novel offer rich social commentary about how we value people. I understand and agree wholeheartedly with the social commentary being made by Morrison.\n\nIn summary, the story is about Pecola Breedlove, an 11-year-old black girl. Her mother, who she calls Mrs. Breedlove, works as a housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family. Her father, Cholly, is a drunk and does not work. The story begins and ends with Pecola, but Morrison gives extensive background on Pecola’s parents.\n\nMrs. Breedlove was born and raised in the south and comes from a large family of origin. As a young woman, Mrs. Breedlove is a hard worker who cares for her family of origin despite it not being easy for her because she is born with a deformed foot. When she marries Pecola’s father and starts her own family, they move north. In her new community, Mrs. Breedlove feels isolated and alone. She is not accepted by the northern women who have different accents, clothes, and behavior expectations than where she came from in the south.\n\nWhen Mrs. Breedlove becomes pregnant with Sam, Pecola’s brother, during her pregnancy she loses two of her teeth. Once she loses her teeth, all hope of fitting in and belonging is lost to Mrs. Breedlove. In this pivotal event, she becomes resigned to the idea that she will never have friends.\n\nMrs. Breedlove escapes into her work. Her only sense of belonging is with the family that pays her to clean their home and care for their daughter. There Mrs. Breedlove feels she has acceptance, appreciation, and control. In her own chaotic and unstable home, she feels out of control. In her employer’s home, she can adequately provide a safe, comfortable, organized, and orderly life. As a result, she comes to feel her own family and home are a nuisance to be endured, rather than a blessing. She sees her family as a burden and prefers caring for the white wealthy family’s home and daughter over her own home and children.\n\nPecola’s father, Cholly Breedlove, had a traumatic childhood. His mother abandoned him on a trash heap when he was nine days old and likely was mentally ill. His father likely never knew about his existence, until Cholly seeks him out later when he’s a young adult, but his father summarily dismisses him with cursing. Spoiler alert - Cholly commits incest with Pecola while drunk and impregnates Pecola.\n\nWith Pecola’s mother and father largely absent from her life and abusive when they are present, Pecola befriends and regularly visits sex workers that live nearby. They treat her to outings and food. The sex workers and some of her peers are her friends through whom she temporarily finds some comfort. However, through a mixture of media, friends, family, and cultural messaging Pecola is programmed to believe that she is “ugly.” She absorbs the cultural messaging that blue eyes are the prettiest eyes, and that hers do not meet the beauty standards. She learns to hate the way she looks.\n\nWoven throughout the story it is indicated how desperately Mrs. Breedlove and Pecola desire to possess the societal standard for physical beauty. Each are convinced it would change their lives if they could achieve having blue eyes and perfect teeth, for example. At one point, Pecola even approaches a former “Reverend “who is rumored to have a special connection with God, to request that she be given blue eyes. In what is arguably the weirdest scene in the book, the “Reverend” instead gives Pecola some poison, and tells her to feed it to a dog. When Pecola does this, the dog dies causing her even further trauma.\n\nMorrison does not spare Pecola and drives her point into readers until the end. Pecola eventually becomes unhinged and disengages from reality. Pecola’s former friends abandon her. She can no longer tell what is real and she creates a pretend friend who eventually abandons her too.\n\nMorrison is relentless in making her point and the tone of this novel is sad, hopeless, and desperate. She does not show her characters mercy in her pursuit to illustrate how the standards of beauty effect women and young girls. There are few redeeming characters, and no characters are spared the impact of the damage of not meeting societal beauty standards. Some characters that start out with some redeeming qualities are stripped of them by the end of the novel. This is not a light read but it is a literary wonder and may expose readers to new ways of seeing the world if they are brave enough to consider the raw perspectives of the characters.",
    "(SPOILERS UPCOMING!!)\n\nThis was my first Toni Morrison book so I definitely did not expect what was going to happen in the book. The physical quality of the book is great and the text was easy to read.\n\nMy prior knowledge of this book and the author was simply what I read on the back. I was expecting it to be a more emotionally difficult read but not as disturbing as it became. The story follows three young black girls in 1940's USA: Claudia and Frieda (who are sisters) and Pecola. The namesake of the book comes from Pecola's obsession to have blue eyes to be accepted by her peers, who, in a society where whiteness is the beauty standard, make fun of her. The book definitely does not hold back on the issue of racism and especially focuses on internalized racism and oppression within the black community as most of the characters are black. It covers a couple of complex matters like wealth, class, societal beauty standards, family, and womanhood.\n\n(SPOILERS START)\n\nThe way Toni Morrison talks about these issues is refreshing as she doesn't hold back and presents it in the way that these issues are in real life; raw, ugly, and complicated. The characters who face oppression in these books rarely, if ever see justice and the novel instead focuses on how they cope with it and the impact of it. The book is written very beautifully and is filled with a cold dose of reality for people who have not experienced oppression or societal pressure to the point that these characters have.\n\nThe only issue I have with the book involves two scenes. One scene details Pecola's rape by her father, and another includes a character named Soaphead Church. The first scene goes into a little too much detail then I would like about the situation, making it seem a bit erotic in nature. A reminder that Pecola is only around 11-12 years old, if I remember correctly. Because of the way Morrison portrays and explains the actions of Pecola's father's thinking that lead to the rape, it leaves me with complicated feelings. There is also another excerpt where a young mixed man, Soaphead Church, writes about his love for little girls and mentions, though not as thorough as the rape scene, touching them and doing it in a way that they \"enjoyed\".\n\nThe largest criticism of the book I have is that many of the scenes in which a character is assaulted is told from a point of view that focuses on the thoughts and actions of the abuser rather than the victim and, of course, shows how they try to justify their actions. Morrison never portrays any of their thinking as right or wrong, but just is. As someone who finds it hard to justify any sort of assult or abuse, it was very hard to finish this book. Great read but I would suggest reading another one of her books like Sula or Song of Solomon as this is definitely the hardest book, emotionally speaking, of Toni Morrison's to finish.",
    "Still thinking about this book even though it's been 2 years since I read it. What a read!",
    "An amazing, gut-wrenching, sad book, which should be required reading for all Americans, yet I gave it 4 stars because I didn't enjoy it at ALL.\n\nToni Morrison does not flinch from the barest of truths about racism - both in terms of the way beauty has been historically portrayed in a fair-skinned, blue eyed, blonde idealistic way, and in terms of the historical and present day racism facing African-American children in America. As I read this book, I happened to see an ad for new dolls with natural black hair, and I was so glad.\nMorrison tells the story of poor Pecola, a set upon, tragic little girl with a damaged mother and a vicious, abused father, Polly and Cholly in a series of stories that intertwine. Pecola comes to live with another family with two fiestier, funnier little girls. This somehow makes her even more tragic. Morrison shows how chance encounters affect the characters view of themselves growing up, and how this in turn hurts their children. She uses language that no one else dares use, and is critical of the way that some African-Americans have willingly enabled a racist culture that holds their own children back while prioritising others.\nSexual abuse is another central theme. I can't help but think that this is in part autobiographical. I loved it, but hated it too. It made me so angry and so sad, but I am glad I gave it my time. I don't think I will ever be able to forget this book.",
    "This is the first book I've read by Toni Morrison. The language and prose are phenomenal in bringing the narrative to life.\nAt first, I wasn't sure about the writing. For example, Toni heads several chapters with paragraphs that has no spaces and seems to fall short of a meaning however, this is all very much part of the overall theme of the lives of a poor black family in the 1940's with the emphasis on the protagonist Pecola who prays for Blue eyes so she can be like her white schoolmates.\n\nThemes such as incest, rape and feeling like an outcast are well-addressed. I lingered in the 'Afterword' chapter as Toni expressed and summarized the writing of The Bluest Eye in such a way that I will be reading this novel again with these moments in mind.",
    "After Toni Morrison's recent death and rave reviews, I read this, her first novel, but am disappointed. Yes, I liked the young black girl's stories and life seen through their eyes and I got the houses they lived in and their poverty and squalor, but then the author gets in the way and passes endless judgements about particular groups of people, for example, types of young girls. It's over-written with poetic language that purports to be profound. Twenty-five percent could have been taken out without loss. I skipped and skipped. Even Picolo's yearning for blue eyes failed to move me. I will read Beloved as I'm told that is Morrison's masterpiece.",
    "This book was on a recommended reading list for wanting to learn & understand about BLM; to sit uncomfortably with my whiteness & my inherent biases.\n\nThis book definitely does that. It immerses the reader into the lives of a number of black characters whose life experiences I can draw no parallels with. A different era, a different country, a different skin colour & most importantly, a whole different level of privilege. The narrative makes the stories of the characters seem matter of fact, common placed. That they just accepted their lot. That for the most part, they had little control over how their lives turned out. This then translates to how internalised the racial disparities & even self-hatred became. That they took the oppression by white people & to some extent oppressed themselves in a white centred world.\n\nThe focus of the book is a young girl, Pecola, who is desperate for blue eyes; the blue eyes seen as most desirable, most beautiful in a white centred world. She genuinely believes she can't be beautiful without them. The book then weaves a tale of how she got to that point,of the people in her life & ultimately what that self hatred does to her. It's a poignant & moving work of fiction that's based in truth that is thought provoking, compelling & definitely sits uncomfortably.",
    "A socially deprived young black girl wishes for a better life. This is very well written with the disturbed and disturbing life of young Pecola so well drawn. There are attempts at humour with the two young girls in her 'foster family'. I found the whole story quite upsetting with what I felt to be excessive talk of menstruation and a high level of sexual abuse, violence, racism (is it possible to allude too much to racism?) and deprivation. I'm well aware that such activities go on but I wonder if it is necessary to place so much emphasis on them. The author's ability to write convincingly is unquestioned but I do question the subject matter's depth."

    "The Myth of American Inequality\n\nThe book is an informative read for both center right and center left individuals. However, I reduced the book’s evaluation by one star because:\n1. The title, specifically “Myth,” is very misleading and may encourage liberals to ignore the information as fake news from the far right. The information provided does not disprove income inequality. Instead, the information provides a better understanding of the degree and sources of inequality and poverty.\n2. The policy implications provided in the last chapter are mundane. Nothing is new in policy or implementation -- a characteristic all too common in political economic discussions. Better information is necessary but not sufficient for advancement.\nThe first five chapters provide a more accurate accounting of earned and after-tax/transfer income and thus of poverty and of quintile income levels than provided by headline government reports. Since the conceptual errors in government’s reporting of income and poverty are well known by economists and the actual data corrections have been available for years, readers could infer that government reporting is intentionally incomplete.\nHowever, neither conservatives nor progressives will fully celebrate the better information. The adjusted earned and transfer/tax income data indicate that the level of U.S. poverty and the gaps between the incomes earned by the lowest two quintiles and the (middle class) third quintile have been dramatically reduced over time by government tax and transfer programs. This success, however, has two adverse residuals. First, those still remaining in poverty and thus deep in the lowest quintile may have personal problems not easily addressed by another expansion of government income support programs. Second, the narrow gaps between the lower two quintiles and the third quintile may be reducing the incentive for individuals to work their way up to the middle class.\nThe progressive heroes, FDR and LBJ, both wanted individuals to be able to earn their livelihoods. Unfortunately, without these government tax and transfer programs, the poverty level based on earned income and the gaps between the earned incomes of the lowest quintiles and the middle class quintile would be dramatic and growing. Government programs that are supposed to develop human capital and thus put individuals on the earned income path to the middle class are failing. Although the revised data does not directly address the handout vs hand-up effect, readers could infer that government social support programs are more a handout than a hand-up.\nThe revised data also indicates a significant decrease in the gap between the highest quintile and the middle quintile due to progressive tax effects. However, with the press focusing on the top 1, 0.1, 0.01, etc. percent of the income distribution, this adjusted data may not seem to liberals a sufficient movement toward greater income equality.\nIn later chapters, the authors apply the revised data to adjust views regarding gender, race and ethnic differences, power couples, single mothers, income growth trends, and tax burdens. Again troubling issues are not totally dispelled, but exaggerations founded on incomplete data are.",
    "I've read Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century and other European Marxists like Zucman and Saez and always felt their ideas on the horrors of income equality never passed the eye test. If capitalism and democracy were so bad, then why have we done so well in the last few hundred years? Life expectancy has risen, education levels have risen, we have more gender equality, more free speech, and more hours of free time. This book really blows holes in their arguments. Instead of the highest quintile having 16x more income than the lowest quintile, this book shows that straightforward, key parameters are missed. The highest quintile gets their income reported as their pre-tax income so their true post tax income which is about 40% less is not used. Also, it does not take into account all the monies and in kind cash that goes to lowest quintile like medicare, medicaid, food stamps and other government programs. When you factor those in, the 16x drops to 4x. That seems very reasonable - the people who work incredibly hard and come up with new ideas should have some reasonable incentive. Additionally, the data shows that their is almost no difference when you factor in taxes and transfers with the bottom three quintiles. That means a middle class household with two working adults is earning in real dollars what somebody with no job is getting. That blows my mind. This data may be not right but it certainly should be introduced as evidence into the political debate. There are so many assumptions around income equality that may not be right and could send us in a dangerous direction. For this country to succeed, we need some reasonable rewards for people who are will taking risks and drive the country forward. There are no good examples of Marxist countries being successful.",
    "I bought this book after reading a review of it in the WSJ. I had a hunch that it would relate to a quote I treasure from Solzhenitsyn: \"Violence does not and cannot flourish by itself; it is inevitably intertwined with lying.\" Lies are a symptom and a cause of evil, and when public policy is based on statistics that are not true, bad things await us in the future. Senator Gramm's book did not disappoint. His prose radiates believability and it's characterized by accessible erudition. I loved every part of it. Frankly, I wish I could wave a magic wand and have every American voter read it.",
    "This book corrects the historical-statistical record. Economic inequality is no worse or even better than 50 years ago. Bureaucracy and Piketty have misrepresented the facts, intentionally, or not. Read between the lines to learn how to get rich yourself!"

    "Everyone needs to read this. I see the climate catastrophists are already dishonestly reviewing a book they have not read and disingenuously trying to cancel its author. If that is not reason enough to buy this book, here is another - it is genuinely brilliant.",
    "This is a somewhat over-hyped ridiculous book, which endlessly quotes the author.\nAE makes 'straw men' arguments throughout- where he creates extreme scenarios and then attacks those, despite these never been said or written. For example, he bases an early foundation premise on the lack of electricty in a hospital 'Africa' on an unverified blog and bases his argument on that. The hospital is not named nor is there a date for when this is supposed to happen.\nThe countries of Africa get barely a mention in the book, despite huge programmes in renewables and solar energy being implemented 'there'.\nThe author , in Chapter 9 makes a big point about levels of carbon dioxide being good for 'life'. He is very careful not to say 'human life'- plant life may well benefit from carbon dioxide. Omissions are important.\nThis leads me to the biggest gaps in the argument.\nAE not once addresses how his 'mastery methods'- which of course are not outlined in specific detail, just waved at- will lower the rising global temperature or lower the rising carbon dioxide level.\nThis is a central point, for the future use of fossil fuels, which he ignores.\nHe also does not address the impact of rising CO2 or temperature on countries, infrastructure and people, meaning there can be no justification for continued fossil fuel use.\nThe author is a philosophy graduate, in no way qualifed or experienced to write on energy matters. And it shows. Far too many general vague points- for example, he spends 3 pages outlining why fossil fuel machines will help people have 'thinking time' (for real, this isn't a joke) and how that will be a benefit. Avoiding of course the impact on the labour market. Another 3 pages are spent describing what a 'tool' is.\nThis is a book that can easily be dismissed by simply looking out your window and seeing the impact of the climate crisis. Yet supporters are lapping this book up, despite not having read it themselves, which is peculiar.",
    "\"Fossil Future\" by Alex Epstein is about how to think about energy. Epstein points out that by the standard of valuing human life and prosperity, fossil fuels have made the world a better place. This is because fossil fuels provide concentrated, cheap, reliable energy that is suitable for many purposes including transport, electricity generation and industrial heat: it gives people a lot of power to change the environment to make it better for human life. By contrast, renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy are dilute, expensive and unreliable and so their adoption instead of fossil fuels would destroy civilisation by depriving us of the energy needed to power our lives. Epstein also considers other sources of energy such as nuclear energy which could be improved to make it a better competitor to fossil fuels if environmentalists would get out of the way because it is safer and more concentrated even than fossil fuels. The book explains why the institutions most people rely on for their information, such as the media and the IPCC, say that fossil fuels are bad and renewable energy is good and how to use the information they provide to improve your knowledge instead of accepting what their public spokesmen say.",
    "This latest book by Epstein bravely attempts to take on the CAGW (Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming – deceptively re-branded “Climate Change”) establishment. The essence of the argument is that fossil fuel energy is foundational to modern civilisation and that the huge and fairly certain negative consequences of rapid decarbonisation will far outweigh the potential benefits of a slightly more stable climate in the future. He argues that the prevailing orthodoxy implicitly elevates “the good of the planet” over the “good of humanity”. It sees the natural world as a delicate, pristine and perfect ecosystem and the impacts upon it of humanity as inherently destabilising and harmful. As Epstein points out, however, without the cheap and abundant energy that allows us to master our environment, the natural world is deeply inhospitable to mankind.\nThere is much more to this book than I can reasonably reflect in a few words and the arguments are compelling. Epstein will of course be vilified for daring to challenge the official dogma, although few, I suspect, will directly engage with the arguments themselves, falling back on ad hominem attacks (“he’s not a climate scientist”; “he’s in the pay of the fossil fuel industry” etc). Will he succeed in changing the debate (which, incidentally, we, the public, deserve to have but have been denied)? I’m not optimistic: many thousands of scientists and institutions are heavily invested in CAGW ideology and there are colossal amounts of (largely public) money sloshing about in this, what has become, a highly lucrative industry. And remember, this stuff is taught in schools as if it were factual.\nA couple of negatives: much of the book is couched in relatively simple language and is very repetitive. I suspect that Epstein has tried to make it as comprehensible as possible to the widest possible audience. But it did not suit me personally. The other point is that asking the question “why are they doing this?” is key to understanding the CAGW ideology. Although Epstein does attempt to tackle this, I would have liked him to paint a larger, more vivid, picture of this prevailing mindset."

    "If you know, you know. This book changes lives. Let me tell you, I was super skeptical at first, but when Dr. Brain Weiss shares his story of falling upon the past life experiences his client was crippled in phobias by on an unconscious level, it blew my entire mind. As a psychiatrist and a man of reason/logic, I love his take on the matter. It's quite compelling to comprehend and once you pick this book up, it'll be a tough one to put down till you're done. If you want to learn about the concept of past lives, and hypnotherapy for past life regression sessions, this is a beautiful place to begin your journey of exploration of every facet of yourself, from this life and the next, and the many that proceeded this conscious experience. Enjoy the journey, and if you find yourself like me, on the other side of this intriguing read with more questions, I recommend Journey Of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton next, though, Many Lives, Many Masters made more of an impact on me from the get go. It's why I've repurchased this for friends time and time again, and revisited the pages of my own copy to help me process things in my own psyche. Dr. Weiss is author of additional amazing books like Only Love Is Real if you want to read more of his work. All in all, I highly recommend and hope you find what resonates true to you.

    "Enjoyed this exploration into past life regression and possible benefits to mental health in this lifetime.",
    "I give the book 2 stars because being a worldwide bestseller, it introduces westerners to the concepts of reincarnation and in between planes. For us Indians, however that itself is not groundbreaking in any way and I felt somewhere that the author is making things up somewhere for the following reasons. There are so many inconsistencies in the book. Like when Catherine goes back to 1578 BC something, how can she know the year as BC?\nAnd then let's assume that somehow her \"superconscious\" mind could connect the dates and tally them with the current calendars, why couldnt she even name the years in many of her other regressions?\nIn several past lives, she says she cant tell the date as there're no newspapers around. Such glaring inconsistency.\nAnd Dr Weiss keeps on reiterating how his logical scientific mind is refusing to believe and how he's got such a rational mind and yet he doesnt even once try to verify any of her past life stories. Like Eric, the fighter pilot from Germany was a recent incarnation so it should've been easy to locate his records if Dr Weiss wanted. But he doesnt even try. And yet he espouses the logical attributes of his own scientific and cynical mind every so often in lieu of any real research.\nIt is my belief that Dr Weiss decided to use his expertise of the human mind to see if he could get away with deceiving millions of people and make money at the same time. Let me clarify...I very much believe that past life regression therapy works and i am also sure that Dr Weiss has had experience on it with his patients. But was there a singular real person who experienced all these past lives in her regressions...that I seriously doubt. All the information about karmic debts, people seeing light when they have near death experiences, different planes, dimensions etc is already well documented.\nI had a baby cousin sister who could remember a past life. So we took her to the place and she had died young in that life so her parents, siblings etc were still alive and she was able to name all of them. That's the way past lives are verified for real. If a 3 year old can recall that kind of information why cant many of Catherine's past lives? Dr Weiss doesnt apply any serious scientific rigour to verify and investigate at least recent past lives at all. Why is that? I've absolutely no idea.\nHowever do not let me dissuade you from reading this book. The book is really gripping as far as narrative goes and the subject matter will be revelatory fir those who've never dabbled in metaphysics before. And even for seasoned outliers the book does sort of put things into perspective. Reading about the subject's past lives and \"her\" imediate concerns pertaining to the circumstances of the scene in that particular past life.......It feels odd......ridiculous even....so we keep coming back again and again feeling the same way, repeating the same patterns, wishing and hoping, struggling and coping...... The ego seems shattered even if only for a moment. And one feels less combative, less demanding, less \"me me me\" actually and more considerate of others. I'm changing my rating....I give the book 4 stars now as I always wanted people to read this book after all. Only the author's insistence on his scientific cred sufficing for lack of any serious inquiry had bothered me. The book is great..... trancendental even. Frankly I...well I have always been obsessed with past lives and such. My favourite movie is Kudrat that I watch a few minutes of every now and then (deals with past life and regression)..........\nAnother thing.....Dr Weiss never once mentioned how his \"research\" was received. Here I should add, I'm reviewing my review in 2020 and have had a bit more experience of life since and have a bit more of a handle on how things are....frankly I never though I would get this many upvotes......but here's what I think now. That thing that I wrote about deceiving....I don't think that was correct not entirely anyway...but it made for interesting reading didn't it.. haha? Here's the thing....there are big powers/ Institutions that deny the truth of rebirth and reincarnation. If Dr Weiss had applied scientific rigour to his research...I mean he must have countless case studies....then the truth of rebirth and reincarnation would be accepted fact. But as of now it's still in the realm of conjecture and here he could have really revolutionised the world. Did the powerful institutions that deny rebirth have a hand in this? Who knows?",
    "I decided to buy this book after watching a documentary on children who remember past lives. This book had sold 1.5 million copies, so I guessed it would be a good read to gain more knowledge on the concept of reincarnation.\nI was a little creeped out on the first page in Chapter one where Dr. Weiss, in his description of Catherine, depicts her as 'an extraordinarily attractive woman' and by Chapter three 'she was beautiful to begin with, now more radiant than ever.' I appreciate this book was written in a different time, but no doctor should evaluate his patient in those terms. He also tells us that apart from her day job, she is shy (but not that shy as she work part-time as a swimwear model) and has been having an affair for six years with a man who sounds exactly like Dr. Weiss (married, Jewish, with two children) She almost sounds like she's his ultimate fantasy; it makes you wonder if she's actually real...\nFrom there, he gives us one anecdotal therapy session after another, where 'Catherine' recalls past lives under hypnosis, revealing what year it is B.C. (which if you lived in that time, you would be completely unaware of) Her hair is the most important feature in her descriptions and mostly was blonde and in a braid. There are a few exceptions: for example, when she had black hair as a slave on a plantation and as a starving curly-haired girl in Ireland...yes, Catherine has ticked all the human experience boxes!\nAs the book progressed, the lives became less detailed - a dark icy cave here, some nice flowers and a gammy leg there; dates, names, and locations, so exact before, now unknown. I suspect is no coincidence the author had openly admitted losing interest at this point in the rather banal, drudgery-filled past lives and deaths of Catherine and instead wanted to hear more about the 'Masters' - voices that came through between life tales, with wisdom 'beyond Catherine's capabilities'.\nThis wisdom informs the author that no other than he - Dr. Weiss - is near the top of the evolutionary/spiritual tree! What a happy co-incidence for the author.\n'You know so much more than the others,' the Masters inform him. 'Be patient with them. They don't have the knowledge that you have.' Presumably the Masters are referring to us gullible fools who go on to buy this book. I stopped there to send it back for a refund.\nAs other reviewers have stated, Dr. Weiss has taken 'Catherine's' word as proof of the afterlife, without researching or trying to verify any of her testimony. He simply implies she is a woman of 'basic intellect' who could know nothing about history or spiritual matters and expects us to accept that.\nIf you're happy to read a book just to reinforce your own beliefs about the afterlife, fill your boots and buy this. If you're a bit more savvy and searching for proof, give it a miss.",
    "Let's get one thing straight - I am not prone to follow every new wind of change or every new fad or path of \"enlightenment\", merely on a whim. I'm also not easily won over....\n\nThis book changed my life. There is no other way for me to say it. As a standalone book it is intriguing, easy to read, gripping, and beyond interesting. As a self help book, something that I genuinely don't think was the author's intention, this book quickly became the book I was recommending to those closest to me.\n\nI was reading Memories Of Heaven by Dr Wayne W Dyer & Dee Garnes, and this book was referenced. That's how I \"found\" it. To be honest I think the book \"found\" me.\n\nIf you are interested in Regression at all then this book is for you. If you have an open mind and you are intrigued by reincarnation then this book is for you. If you are considering trying a session of Regression Therapy then THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU. I was so blessed by it, and gleaned some important information for my own life. It gave me an insight into the Therapy side of Regression and prepared me for my first session. Up until I read this book I was merely curious about past lives and the whole concept of reincarnation. After reading it I understood a lot more and was a lot more aware of the healing potential and spiritual benefits of Regression Therapy.\n\nI hope this review helps someone make their mind up either way. xx",
    "While I enjoyed reading the book, I was spurred on through it more because I was constantly looking for something more concrete. The counselling/research sessions seemed full of wasted opportunities, particularly regarding questioning techniques.\n\nFor decades, since my mid teens, I have been convinced internally of reincarnation and the purposes of our lives on Earth but if I wasn’t already of this mind, this book wouldn’t convince me in the slightest.\n\nThere were too many closed questions that could simply be answered yes or no. I longed for more open questioning that might have elicited more detail. When there was more detail, eg what sounded like it might be a county in Ireland, or the port in South Wales, Hamstead, it wasn’t investigated! To my knowledge there isn’t an Irish county or welsh port by the names specified. So where does that leave us? Dr Weiss blatantly ignored this. No investigation.\n\nMore description could have been elicited given Catherine revisited some lives more than once and Dr Weiss could have planned future questioning, should this arise. Isn’t this what scientists do? Observe, research, hypothesise? Investigate?\n\nI also wanted to know how the subject, Catherine would know it was nearly 2000 BC.\nThere would be no concept of this at this time - yet no pharaoh’s name was mentioned to tie down a possible timeframe - and it wasn’t asked for. Surely all Egyptians would know their pharaoh?\nThe people all lived in fear… fear of what exactly? More information re the building of the pyramids could have been explored. It was all terribly superficial.\n\nRe Eric the German. Again… more detail. Surely people would know the towns and villages they came from. Some vagueisms regarding people not being happy with government. Is that a term Germans would have used? Not a mention of Hitler? No questioning around “who’s in charge of said ‘government’?”.\n\nGiven the author had had no experience prior to this of past lives and spirituality, how had this put him on the higher plane already - according to the masters? If he’d been a Buddhist monk I could have believed it, but a closed-minded pragmatic scientist? How did he skip the other levels? He’s no Dolores Cannon! He appears to have fast-tracked dimensions, snakes and ladders style.\n\nOften he said that Catherine would not have known these facts as she was an ordinary person. How does he know? In the words of Judge Judy, “Don’t tell me what she knows!” Ordinary people go to school, watch TV… there’s no reason some facts could come from the subconscious or a collective conscious, if it exists. Cryptomnesia? My son at the age of 7 could have told you loads about Canopic jars and after-death rites in Egypt. He’s probably consciously forgotten a lot of it now. Dr Weiss never showed evidence that he’d discussed Catherine’s possible pre-knowledge. All in all, seems to have made the gross assumption models are shy and not very bright!\n\nI would have liked to have known if he had discussed this with any other psychiatrists practising regressive techniques. After all, if Catherine is so ordinary, this can’t be the first time it’s happened; we know it isn’t if the testimonies of Edgar Cayce for example are true.",
    "This is one of those books that is even too easy to dismiss as \"made up\". Yet, the credentials of the author speak for themselves.\nIf you are interested in these sort of topics - albeit being dubious, like me - this is a book that you <can> read. And there are many others written by authors (physicians and scientists, mainly) which are beyond suspicion. I also believe it is too easy a position to say \"that's all bonkers and the author must be a nutter\". Putting our own believes in doubt is a hard and painful process. However: how else are we going to grow? So, although the read is probably not for everybody, I strongly recommend it because it will make you think and ask questions.\nI found the read easy, gripping and well representative of what a man of science must go through when confronting such an extraordinary experience.\nThe only reason why I do not give 5 stars, is because I believe that the author should have add a chapter explaining how the academic world has received this story. Indeed there are a few lines about it, yet I believe that a more detailed account would behelpful. Reading how others, especially in the scientific world, have reacted and why they have accepted it or not, may help readers to make sense of their doubts and questions,"

    "I finally got around to The Satanic Verses. You just have to read a book which got a death sentence for the author. Really, after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued the fatwa calling for Salmon Rushdie's death, Rushdie's Japanese translator was killed, his Italian translator and his Norwegian publisher were both stabbed (didn't die) and his Turkish translator ducked, but the miscreants burned down his hotel and killed 37 non-fatwa folks. So I sort of had to see what it was all about. I assumed it was culturally rich and I attended two lecture series on Islam to help me catch at least some of the obscurities. I'm sure I missed a bunch, though. It is culturally rich, alright, but more in Indian culture than Islamic and I did not attend any Indian lectures.\n\nThere are two major characters in the book: Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha. Both are more or less self made guys who have each attained some success in entertainment fields. Gibreel in movies, a regular heartthrob, and Saladin in voiceover work where his speciality is upper class English diction. Saladin hates being Indian and has decided that his heart belongs to England and to his ultimately and callously unfaithful wife, wait for it, Pamela (is that English or what?). The two (Saladin and Gibreel) find themselves on a flight from India to England which is first hijacked and then blown up at cruising altitude where the two, during the long trip to Earth, have a discussion which is interrupted by, of all things, their survival from the fall (it is instructive to note that during the plummet, Saladin chooses to use up some of his apparently limited time by singing Rule Britannia). Things change, one might say.\n\nFourteen or so centuries earlier we are introduced to Mahound (I am given to understand that referring to The Prophet Muhammed in that fashion is disrespectful) who is in the process of attempting to convert the polytheistic Arabs of Jahilia. What? I thought it was Mecca. Well, it's deep, see? Jahilia is apparently an Arabic term meaning \"ignorance of the will of God\", which describes the pre conversion state of the Meccans, I assume. Things are not going well. Muhammed is in the process of receiving the Holy Quran from God through the angel Gabriel (Arabic \"Gibreel\". See where this is going?), while at the same time preaching monotheism with only limited success. Temptation arises when the head Sultan (or something) asks Muhammed to just spare a few, only three, of the three hundred sixty gods to please the ruler's wife whose family is in charge of the temples of the three female gods and gets money during the pilgrimages. Muhammed goes to the mountain cave, enters his trance and comes back down the hill and permits the three female gods to be honored. There is a hoo-hah among the followers of Muhammed because they have bought into monotheism and are disappointed. Muhammed goes back up the mountain, into the cave, back down the mountain into Jahilia and announces that the verses allowing the three gods were from Satan, not God, and withdraws them. Get it? The Satanic Verses. They're the real deal, actually existing in some ancient Islamic texts, but fervently denied currently.\n\nThat's it. That's the story which got people stabbed and burned up. Muhammed was misled by Satan, caught on, rectified the mistake and continued to receive valid revelation from God through Gabriel so that ultimately the Quran was the direct and pure word of God. I don't get it. Seems to me like the God who created the entire Cosmos would have enough horsepower to deal with an errant author on His own. It even seems to me that it wasn't all that nasty in the first place - most Muslims assiduously avoid deification of Muhammed. I think they are just grouchy. I oversimplify somewhat. It can be said that the general tone of the episodes concerning the revelations to the Prophet can fairly be said to call into question whether maybe some of the revelations were Muhammed dealing with ad hoc situations in his personal life. Was there a disagreement with his favorite wife? Up comes a revelation setting her straight on the issue. So some Muslims got angry with Salmon.\n\nHere I must digress and impose a hiatus while I read Nikos Kazantzakis, The Last Temptation of Christ, a book which had a similar effect in the Christian community, although I do not think anyone was stabbed or burned. Also, not atypically, the reaction was not to the book, which is sort of fat and not likely to be read by our Christian lot, but rather to the movie made from the book. I shall choose the book as the basis for my comparison knowing full well that I am opting for twelve hours or so as opposed to two, a significant sacrifice to the blogger's muse.\n\nI will get back to this when I complete Last Temptation and can think more clearly about the rather common, but to me inexplicable, violent response to perceived blasphemy.\n\nOkay, now I am better informed. The Last Temptation of Christ is a book from the 1950's and is afflicted with theology even older than that. I suspect that Kazantzakis wrote it as a sort of Midrash, a riff on Jesus' humanity, which seems a legitimate and loyal-Christian kind of thing to do. There are distractions, of course, which seize the attention (Mary Magdalene is nowhere in the Bible described as a whore), but all in all the attempt is nicely done to make the point, which seems to be that Jesus is an example of how the most attractive and intense temptations of life can be overcome. The point is made with rather extreme examples: Jesus waiting in line at a whorehouse, Jesus sucking up to Romans by making crosses for their executions, Jesus trying to make God hate Jesus so that the load of Messiah-ship may be taken off, but it all comes out alright in the end, good triumphs, evil is defeated. So what's wrong with that? What on Earth about the book prompted such vituperative rants from offended believers?\n\nIt's fundamentalism, that's what it is. Not exactly a spoiler. Those who struggle with a subconsciously held worry that their beliefs are fragile, puny, ephemeral and subject to destruction by countervailing views will always react with violence to any description of their orthodoxy which strays from the company line. And so it is with Satanic Verses. The true believer must leap to the defense of God, who by reason of frailty one supposes, is insufficiently strong to handle the defense himself. Apparently God exhausts himself with the first iteration of the revelation and must rely on believers to keep the revelation pure and unsullied by those who would vary the storyline. It's sort of silly, although the silliness is somewhat blunted by the firebombs and terrorism with which believers often make their point.\n\nThe Satanic Verses is beautifully written, funny and marvelously inventive. Saladin, for instance, does not quite get the angelic treatment of Gibreel in that Saladin morphs into a faun, Pan, some sort of goat-legged horned-head Priapic sulfur stinking denizen of Hell with the personality of a complete sissy. It is a delightful read, and I wholeheartedly recommend it - just don't read it looking for some hardcore blasphemy. Beats me if it's in there anywhere.",
    "It looks dotty and a bit blurry. Honestly looks better through iPhone pictures than in person. Still readable and in fine condition.",
    "Bought the book in the name of freedom of speech and the fight against ignorance and violence.\nI will probably not read the book.",
    "I finally got around to reading this decades after it came out. The recent attack on Rushdie sparked my interest in it, coupled with the fact I’m an avid daily reader now, where I wasn’t when it originally came out. I will probably have to re-read it at some point as I had trouble understanding/following the storyline. It seems that artistically it’s well written, but as someone mentioned in another review, it’s not the classic page-turner that a lot of us like. It was a heavy-going read that took some effort to get through. It’s definitely a “bucket list” kind of book to read, but it won’t be very high up on my favorites list.",
    "Arrived earlier than expected, very neatly packed and book in a very good condition. Thank you!",
    "I've waited a good two weeks after finishing this book to write this review. I wanted to let my mental dust settle. Now I feel obliged to my fellow readers and to my own academic pursuits to have at it. First, I must say that this is one of the few books I've read since my retirement nine years ago that was really WORK to read. Nevertheless, I was compelled to buy it, because of its historical importance: I needed to see what it was that caused its author to receive a condemnation to death by a very highly placed religious source. They put a price put on his head — a bounty — to encourage his murder. The author suffered years of agonizing grief hiding from the madmen searching him out. Fortunately, in the best interests of civilization, they haven't found him — yet.\n\nAs for the literature, indeed the author is brilliant — an artist with the language, sometimes a poet. But the author, while brilliant with his craft, is NOT a good story teller. The story rambles painfully. I found my own agony just trying to follow it. The genre is called \"magical realism,\" if I recall correctly. After finishing the book, I had to call it up on Wikipedia to learn that it's actually three stories in one. Yes, I knew going in that it was offensive to Islam, thus the fatwa. Nevertheless, I hung in, trying to stay up with the different characters, some of whom have three different names.\n\nHad I not some background with Islamic studies, I would have been left behind on page five. I've lived in Saudi Arabia for almost a year in the mid seventies, I've read the Quran, the hadith and a biography of Muhammad. Even with that background, I was BARELY able to recognize the satire. I say EMPHATICALLY, unless you FIRST read at least a biography of Muhammad, DO NOT read this book!! Then, tape your ankles!!\n\nFinally, apart from recognizing the author's genius, I'll assess the real value of this novel at the bottom line: Together with the outrageous reaction to it and the advocation of a heinous crime by those offended, we are helped in our understanding of the utterly low level of civilization among a large part of our population today. Is there hope for them in the 21st century? You tell me.",
    "Book was as described if not better. Would use vendor again.",
    "The contents of this novel is fine. That is not what this review is about. Because there are a bunch of versions of this book to buy, I bought the paperback on this listing, and it is ... Weird.\n\nThe text is artifacted, like a JPG saved too many times. The pages look like they've been xeroxed five times over and then printed into the book. It blows my mind. The actual cover is lovely, and then the pages are white copy paper with oddly pixelated text. What the hell?",
    "No one should be physically attacked for the words they write.",
    "Some 30 years after its publication, I picked up this book (second hand) to see what all of the fuss had been about in the pre-ISIS days of the Ayatollah Khomeini who had replaced the Sha of Iran (Persia).\nBefore reading this huge rambling (but often amusing) 540+ pages; a difficult book. Do read the Wikipedia page on the Rushdie Fatwa resulting from this book and explanations of its origins. There was, as of 2016, still severe controversy relating to the author and the Muslim allusions in (and interpretations of) his story. It will also help to have an understanding of Indian cultural (and food) terms, the culture in Mumbai in the 1980’s and some of the historical friction between Christians and Muslims. The book is still banned in many countries with a significant Muslim population.\nTo the average Western reader this may be seen as a simple (?) comical tale of the amazing survival of two Indian actors, blown out of the skies by a fanatical suicide bomber, then their experiences and escapades in England, supplemented by flashbacks to their historical development in India and subsequent interaction of Asians with UK culture at the time of the Thatcherite years (significant institutional racism and even racial violence).\nOne survivor takes on the attributes of the angel Gabriel, the other the devil Saladin and we follow their escapades, lives and loves and their reversion to more human form. The story is constantly interwoven with actual and imagined historical events.\nIs it religiously offensive? Possibly to those of a strict Muslim upbringing and their religious leaders interpreting what is said alongside the Quran. I am sure than many decried the book without ever reading it – as happened with many other books/ films which attracted notoriety.\nCompared to the non-event Christian fuss over Monty Python’s “The Life of Brian”, there is a certain fantasy section relating to certain reported history of the prophet which could certainly be interpreted negatively by those of a strongly Muslim religious view (You need to read beyond 300+ pages to come to this section) – see also the Wikipedia review mentioned above.\nIs it worth reading? If the above does not put you off but intrigues you get hold of a library copy and see!",
    "I bought a physical copy of this book when it was originally published and throroughly enjoyed it. It was the first book of Sir Salman Rushdie's I bought and I went on to buy and enjoy many others.\n\nI am rebuying the kindle version because I haven't read the book in a long time. Given the recent unconscionable attack on Rushdie, it seems the right time to revisit this one.",

If you can't read the rest of this book without the anti-jewish chapter, I don't know what to tell you. Go grab the PDF online or something.\n\nPersonally I think it was a good move. This is a book that's about 80% crazy, 20% truth. After all this guy did predict a wave of school shootings in 1991, as well as warn us that a major attack was going to happen that Bin Laden would be blamed for well before 9/11. I think people should focus on those kind of points in the book, and not the dumb stuff.\n\nThis is a must have for conspiracy people, but it is a difficult read.

Like \"reptilian overlord lizard people\" crazy. However this book is the perfect embodiment of \"a broken clock is right twice a day\", because some of the more down to earth predictions he made did end up coming true.\n\nI would recommend this to people that are into conspiracies, and I would also add that you shouldn't dismiss everything the author says just because a lot of what he says is out there, because there are a few EXTREMELY informative parts of this book.\n\nI mean the author said it himself: listen to everyone believe nothing unless you can prove it with your own research.\n\nAs far as the book itself goes it was actually much bigger than I thought it would be, and the cover and paper quality is much better than I thought it would be.\n\nI definitely recommend this to anyone who's into the conspiracy stuff.

I came here expecting to find new insights on addiction justified by neurological underpinnings but found nothing but a list of anecdotes and some half baked social commentary.\n\nTo anyone who wants to learn about the mechanism I’d suggest the Huberman Lab podcast or the book: “The molecule of more”",
    "I enjoyed this book. It is an easy read and describes the basic neurochemistry of addiction in a very engaging way. Using the pain-pleasure balance analogy Lembke is able to describe clearly why painful, not just pleasurable stimuli can be addictive to. As a recovering addict I can relate very closely to many of her patients’ experiences.",
    "Dr Lembke writes in an articulate and accessible way. I'm not a scientist and Dopamine Nation helped me understand the fine balance between the pleasure and pain experiences of our reward systems. She uses great case studies to illustrate and humanises the book by talking about her own addictions, which show up in an unexpected way.\nIt was a page turner for me, and I felt the \"pain\" associated with our dopamine system when I finished it.",
    "I bought this book to read more about the role of Dopamine in the body and learnt far more than I expected. The addiction which plagues humans is fired by a rise in Dopamine then drops to try to balance the system. This see/saw effect is necessary to ensure chemical balance and the opioid/drug addiction seen across the world is evidence of the damage done by seeking pleasure without measure.",
    "We have gone from a world of scarcity, short-lived lives in often brutal conditions to a world of utter pleasure, all the comforts that could only have been dreamed of in the past and where we seek pleasure at all cost and hits of the neurotransmitter hormone that is dopamine fuels this pleasure seeking world in which we have a lot of time and a lot of resources. In a lot of ways we have gone from avoiding pain to now seeking pleasure at all costs without any awareness of what is going on and how the world and we work.\n- We have become all consuming and seeking addiction in a myriad of ways; whether it be shopping, alcohol, drugs, consumerism, spending too long on social media and basically seeking pleasure at all cost. An interesting part that we have learnt recently is that pleasure and pain occur in the same part of the brain. And as we have become a nation of addicts addicted to at least something, particularly seeking distraction from normalised behaviour, we can learn a lot about how society and individuals with addictions can help with understanding everything else around us.\n- We're also sociable animals and what we see for example on the Internet has almost normalised values and behaviours that previously we would've found obscene or difficult to handle. This when mixed with dopamine can cause a heady cocktail.\n- This is from the book: “Seventy percent of world global deaths are attributable to modifiable behavioural risk factors like smoking, physical inactivity, and diet. The leading global risks for mortality are high blood pressure (13 percent), tobacco use (9 percent), high blood sugar (6 percent), physical inactivity (6 percent), and obesity (5 percent). In 2013, an estimated 2.1 billion adults were overweight, compared with 857 million in 1980. There are now more people worldwide, except in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, who are obese than who are underweight. Rates of addiction are rising the world over. The disease burden attributed to alcohol and illicit drug addiction is 1.5 percent globally, and more than 5 percent in the United States. These data exclude tobacco consumption. Drug of choice varies by country. The US is dominated by illicit drugs, Russia and Eastern Europe by alcohol addiction. Global deaths from addiction have risen in all age groups between 1990 and 2017, with more than half the deaths occurring in people younger than fifty years of age. The poor and undereducated, especially those living in rich nations, are most susceptible to the problem of compulsive overconsumption. They have easy access to high-reward, high-potency, high-novelty drugs at the same time that they lack access to meaningful work, safe housing, quality education, affordable health care, and race and class equality before the law. This creates a dangerous nexus of addiction risk.”\n- We've also become more attuned at trying to distract ourselves than wake up to what is actually the human condition. We often are sleep deprived and feel anxious because we put so much pressure on ourselves and our working conditions are bad and where as before we might've said this is just part of the normal human condition of sadness, we have now labelled it a mental health problem and we try to find ways to ease the pain through distraction and addiction featuring highs of pleasure that reward our system by rushes of dopamine.\n- There are interesting experiments where you get a dog to associate the ringing of a bell with the reward of food and this in turn is caused by dopamine in the brain to seek pleasure in something that is anticipated. In many people the greater joy is more in the wanting and seeking pleasure for example drug abuse or sexual activity then sometimes in the actual act of sleeping with somebody or taking the drug. We have reward systems that are triggered by dopamine.\n- There are also some interesting facts about the percentage of dopamine in the brain of a rat in a box. Give it chocolate and this increases the basal output of dopamine in its brain by 55 percent, sex is 100%, nicotine is 150%, cocaine is 225% and amphetaimne is 1000%.\n- The author then goes through a series of approaches to help us work out how we can support and change addictive nature to dopamine. It begins with the acronym DOPAMINE. D stands for data, O stands for objective, P stands for problems, A means abstinence, M is mindfulness, I is for insight, N is for next steps. Mindfulness is where we observe our mind and how it processes things. It's a bit like looking at the Milky Way from far away and trying to make some objective understanding of it near and far and that's the same thing that we do with our mind. By understanding and observing how our mind works and processes information we can then start to change how we feel about whatever addiction\n- In experiments carried on rats and mice when they are given abstinence to substances that they have become addicted to, as soon as that substance comes back again, the rats tended to gouge and binge, showing how those who appear to be susceptible to addictions - after a period on the wagon can get really messed up. But the book also looks for things that are in our normal use such as smartphones, TV and food. And how we can manage those.\n- The author also talks about the harm that medication is doing in regards to treatment of mental health disorders. We are over prescribing medications for many conditions which are part of the human condition and then we are then seen that actually it doesn't appear to be fixing the problem because there are more people with mental health problems whilst increases in medication for treatment in mental health has also risen.\n- The author also talks about the link between pain and pleasure. Interesting research about cold water immersion and people having cold showers that can up dopamine and help people with withdrawal symptoms. Having seen some of the work of Wim Hof (the iceman) this corresponds with some of his treatments in regards to support and people with addiction problems and it's very interesting to consider. I have started having cold showers.\n- The book also talks about rational honesty and how we are story generating machines and sometimes we need to have some honesty rather than to live close to others and ourselves as the first part of treatment. There is an interesting link between the frontal cortex which manages emotional regulation and decision-making and that when stimulated by pain seems to work more effectively in managing dopamine. There may also be some evidence that pain can help stimulate the frontal cortex. There is also a link between pain and pleasure and the stimulation of hormones can be related by both pain and pleasure.\n- A fascinating book on how we can be ruled by our hormones, particularly dopamine, and by understanding this, we can help ourselves to lead better lives."

    "This is the autobiography of actor Michael K. Williams and co- writer, Jon Sternfeld.\nWilliams is best known for playing one of the most brilliant characters ever written for television, Omar Little from the groundbreaking\nHBO series, \"The Wire\". He was a superb talent and he takes us on a journey of his life from the projects in Brooklyn, to stardom, all the time fighting his demons of addiction to make a positive difference in the lives of others. Bullied as a child, berated by a mother and heroin \" tough love\" standards, Williams learned what skills he had and channeled it into the performing arts. This is not an easy read. He crashes and burns at the height of his stardom, brushes himself off and tries and tries again. He falls many times. He commits to helping other vulnerable young Black men, just like him, victims of racism, caste and the systematic failure of this country to acknowledge its role in keeping this awful system alive.\nMichael paid his dues, and paid forward the hard work, to others in his community so they could learn from him. He also learned from those he helped. Committed, vulnerable, all too human in fighting his demons, Michael left us September 6, 2021. This work is his legacy. It is a story to be shared with anyone who has felt the sting of hatred, bullying, told you're never good enough that yes, you can win and as Maya Angelo so beautifully wrote: \"And yet I rise.\"\nWe miss you, Mike and thank you for the courage it took to open up your heart and arms for others. You are truly redeemed.",
    "The most damage humans are some of the most beautiful soul. The honesty and purity of MKW story is a breath of fresh air. To hear him talk about his struggles, insecurities, fears and failures is not something you often see in our community(African American community) we are often told to hide our weaknesses which usually leads to not dealing with our demons. I can relate to him on so many levels. MKW was a beautiful soul with deep love for people at times more than he loved himself. He was just scratching the surface on the impact he was about to make in young people lives. Great book. Rest in paradise O.",
    "This is a book not just of his life but life of America for black children. Michael was raw and open about his life of trauma whether it be addiction abuse or in the environment he was raised in. But he also went out of his way to share the stories of others like him! This is something culturally as Black people we can understand. He spoke directly to the new generation and uplifted us on the changes we are making. Not only that but was working towards giving us the tools so we could make those changes. Michael was a phenomenal man and I was not aware of all the work he was doing. I’m not really big on TV or social media but I did know he was a great actor and a beautiful man. But after reading this book I really wish I had more time to get to know him And see his work come into fruition in front of his eyes. This book is a must read! This book is a must buy! I will be surprised if this book does not sell out. I had preordered the audiobook book but once I finished it I had to get my hands on a physical copy.",
    "Michael K. Williams poured his heart into every role he played just like he poured his heart into this book! I cried for Mike, I smiled for Mike, I prayed for Mike, I got angry for Mike but most importantly I’m celebrating for Mike! Your life work was not in vain, your legacy lives on! Million of tears were shed for you!",
    "You get to know the man, his tenderness and why his history did not affect how he treated others.",
    "This book was excellent I wish I could have encouraged him in his ministry with his work that he had done has indeed spoken for him.",
    "I love how Michael made it out of his neighborhood to follow his dreams but went back to support the youth of these poor communities and give them a voice.",
    "Read from start to finish in a day\neven with knowing the outcome. The honest words throughout and kindness were moving. Cleveland childhood and Baltimore since 1987. Spoke to me."

    "It is remarkable at how lucid Kissinger's writing remains at his current age but Leadership is a fine addition to his recent contributions. It Is an overview of 6 leaders with whom he had direct interaction (though to varying degrees) in the post WWII period. The study includes Adenauer in reconstruction Germany, de Gaulle both during and after WWII, Nixon (for whom he was of course most interactive), Anwar Sadat , Lee Kuan Yew and finally Margaret Thatcher. Each was a great leader for different reasons, guiding their populace through challenging times to achieve strategic goals that required conviction and dynamism. Today we seem lacking in such leadership and have for some time. Despite that not being the explicit point of the book, the character descriptions we get from this are a reminder that in challenging times the qualities of great leadership can have generational impact.\n\nThe book is largely chronological and starts with Konrad Adenauer, the founder of the CDU, the foundational democratic party in the aftermath of WWII. Kissinger details his life and his moral principles that determined his character and world view. Adenauer was exiled from Germany in the Third Reich but returned to try to unify a broken people and was a leader who wanted the population to come to grips with its history as well as build a new foundation for a revived future under more traditional Christian values. Kissinger discusses how Adenauer guided the company and the political terrain in the aftermath of the war as well as attempted to guide Germany and Europe into greater unification despite the historical baggage. Kissinger moves on to his contemporary de Gaulle, a completely different character who also guided France during times of extreme challenges. Charles de Gaulle attempted to gain legitimacy as the leader of the France who had been politically disenfranchised and the true resistence to Nazi Germany. Kissinger discusses how his personal amplification of his relevance on the global arena was of constant annoyance to the true leaders of the War effort like Churchill and Roosevelt but despite his outsized self image he used it to better the lot of France and its relevance in the post war era. Furthermore his leadership in the war period led to his assumption of leadership in its aftermath. Kissinger discusses at length the challenges de Gaulle met and navigated successfully including the dissolution of the empire and in particular Algeria. Kissinger spends significant time discussing Nixon who of course hired Kissinger first as National Security advisor but later as Secretary of State. Kissinger is highly favorable of Nixon's geopolitical acumen and his ability to understand the complex landscape but to distill it to the relevant core principles to be decided upon. He also reflects about the character flaws of Nixon that ultimately led to his resignation and the challenges of unwinding the involvement in Vietnam. But Kissinger focuses on the major achievements including resurrecting relations with China. Kissinger spends time on Andwar Sadat and his highly principled and strategic vision of creating a more peaceful Middle East with stability with Israel, which at the time, and even now remained anathema to many around him. Following Nasser, his tenure was assumed to be short but Sadat was a true leader of vision and worked tirelessly to incrementally step back from the brink with Israel that ultimately led to more stability. Despite much frustration with his political peers Sadat stuck to the principles of prioritizing peace to achieve strides that would have otherwise been unachievable. Kissinger also spends a chapter on Lee Kuan Yew who took Singapore from an irrelevant island connected to Malaysia to a world class city that attracted the best of talents. Such a trend continues today with the relative decline of Hong Kong. The utilitarian principles of Lee are discussed and his ultimate pragmatism to generate results while remaining proper in action was shown to be the critical pillars of his character and strategy. The wisdom and lessons of his leadership remain of utmost importance even today where his warnings about the non-universality as well as relevance of China's strength were appreciated early and vocally. Kissinger ends with Margaret Thatcher who guided the UK through the inflationary aftermath of the oil shock and its unionized labor into the more productive UK that carried a new torch in the 90s and into the first decade of 2000s. He discusses navigating the Falklands as well as the HK handover and how her conviction and principles guided her through exceptionally challenging times to leave Britain measurably stronger and more stable. Her eventual downfall was tragic and seemed to be of superficial substance but nonetheless her legacy of strength of character was an aid in the end of Cold War era that increased the relevance of Britain on the global scale.\n\nLeadership in Six Studies is an overview of great leaders from the perspective of Kissinger in the post WWII era. Obviously it is subjective and a function of the author's direct interaction with this cohort, which says just as much about the author himself. But nonetheless the character profiles are compelling in their description of what it took to be a great leader and why the characters chosen were great. They each faced unique challenges and had unique personalities but despite the difference in circumstances and character all helped their people achieve better outcomes and left the world a better place than they encountered it. Definitely an enjoyable and informative read.",
    "This book provides an elegant and economical window into the mindsets of six important 20th Century world figures whom Henry Kissinger knew in varying degrees and whose lives he has studied with his usual insight and flair for stylish encapsulation. What is probably most notable about it is that here Kissinger moves beyond his traditional adherence to the form of statecraft for which he credits Richard Nixon -- the strategy of equilibrium -- to reflect admiringly on five other leadership styles -- perhaps most surprisingly, Margaret Thatcher's strategy of conviction -- and celebrate approaches far different from that for which he himself has been recognized ever since his first book, A World Restored, written some 70 years ago. In that respect, at 99, he is still capable of novelty. Would that we all be so open-minded at that age if we ever reach it.\n\nNonetheless, the book disappoints in one important respect. His least interesting portrait among the six is that of the subject he knew best and is most identified, Richard Nixon. His essay about Nixon is a neat summary of their White House collaboration for those disinclined to wade through his exhaustive memoirs White House Years and Years of Upheaval, but it also lacks those books' knowing detail which had offered hope that if Kissinger ever took the time to focus solely on Nixon, he could lay bare his personality and character -- which the late William F. Buckley, Jr. once said were as impenetrable as the Rosetta Stone -- like no one else before him. His essay here falls far short. Other than his graveside eulogy to Nixon, this portrayal is as respectful and uniformly positive an evaluation of Nixon as Kissinger has ever given. Nixon is described here as a wise, decisive, and sometimes courageous statesman. But this section, uniquely among the six, is also written as unadorned as wire-service news copy. And is it even honest?\n\nThere is reason to doubt. One of Nixon's first-term challenges was securing funding for an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system. Nixon's mentor Dwight Eisenhower regarded ABM systems as inconsistent with the regnant U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy he, more than anyone, had founded -- massive retaliation (later renamed mutual assured destruction (MAD) by the Kennedy-Johnson administration) to any first strike by a nuclear adversary; as impractical, inherently destabilizing, and likely to fuel an arms race with potential adversaries fearing we were taking defensive steps in anticipation of our own first strike. Eisenhower counseled Nixon to forego it. At the time, Nixon's pursuit of initial ABM funding was therefore generally seen as an effort to secure a bargaining chip to trade away in strategic arms talks. SALT I restricted both the Soviets' and our rights to such systems to one national capital deployment and one other, which, for technical and other reasons, neither ever effectively built out. That result was, for a long time, seen as SALT I's principal achievement (its offensive launcher \"limitations\" being immediately mooted by unrestrained multiple warhead development). To my knowledge, Kissinger, back then, never questioned that appraisal.\n\nDespite the still prevailing absence of technical feasibility, President Reagan began heavily funding ABM development (dubbed \"star wars\") ten years later and, fifteen years thereafter, President George W. Bush formally withdrew from the 1972 ABM treaty Nixon and Kissinger had negotiated. By this time, Kissinger was suggesting that these actions were not only strategically right, but morally required. But, as Eisenhower had predicted, they soon spurred a revived arms race with Russia's new hypersonic missile capacity their most recent unfortunate offspring. What does Kissinger say about all this in his essay on Nixon? He blandly characterizes Nixon's ABM strategy not as seeking a bargaining chip for use in securing arms constraints, but as the thoughtful precursor to Reagan's intent to actually deploy such a system even though its functionality is as elusive today as it was fifty years ago. One might have expected Kissinger to be more forthcoming about these inconsistencies.\n\nDuring Kissinger's tenures as Nixon's national security adviser and Secretary of State, there was a constant flow of leakage from his allies and even his close aides such as the late Alexander Haig that Nixon was less than competent, emotionally erratic, and even a drunkard. Kissinger himself is said to have indulged in demeaning gossip at Georgetown dinner parties. The only hint of imperfection here is that Nixon, echoing what Kissinger wrote in his White House memoirs, was inattentive to detail. And perhaps the more negative appraisals of Nixon during their tenures together were simply the outgrowth of understandable tensions in their high-stakes lives at the time. But what explains the difference between Kissinger's fawning treatment of Nixon's Middle East peace negotiating acumen here and what Martin Indyk wrote just last year in his magisterial Master of the Game, his exhaustive study of Kissinger's mid-1970's Middle East diplomacy? The Indyk book may be the most comprehensive and illuminating study of American diplomacy ever written, even more detailed than Kissinger's own work on his Middle East diplomacy. No future Secretary of State or national security adviser should fail to study it carefully before assuming office. Its principal source was Henry Kissinger, and the person to whom Indyk attaches the title \"Master\" is not Richard Nixon. With day-to-day, even hour-to-hour information that could only have come from Kissinger himself, Nixon is described in Indyk's book as, if not a drunkard, both detached and desperately reliant on Kissinger's advice and direction to contain his innate vacillation and emotionalism. What accounts for this discrepancy? Or the many others alert readers will draw from this work?\n\nHenry Kissinger is a brilliant man, a skilled negotiator, and a deeply informed and perceptive thinker and writer. Whether he is or ever will be candid is decidedly less clear.",
    "For those, especially in the UK who would like to know more about Lee Kwan Yew there is no better description of him, his life and his importance to Singapore. I enjoyed the who book but knowing more about Lady Thatcher and Lee Kwan Yew than the other 4 leaders I can say that Kissinger has those two off to a T. I found his understanding of them exquisite.",

    "He leído con detenimiento el libro en su versión original inglesa y le he dado una calificación totalmente negativa.\n\nA continuación pretendo dar las argumentaciones en las que me me basado para emitir tal opinión si bien antes creo conveniente hacer algunas reflexiones que faciliten entender mi postura y el porque de mis conclusiones.\n\nHeinz Alfred, en primer lugar, es restrictivo y excluyente en lo que deberíamos entender por \" líder político\" , ya que se cierne solo a personas que han dirigido gobiernos, y mi primera reflexión es esa duda.\n\nQue es un líder político ? Alguien producto de las urnas o de las maniobras para ocupar Gobiernos.\nYo creo que NO, que un líder político es aquel que simplemente ha hecho progresar a la Sociedad.\n\nBaste un ejemplo y no voy de pelota, Amazon , omito nombre y apellidos , es por ejemplo un líder político por qué ha permitido a sus ciudadanos, que no súbditos, publicar libremente nuestras opiniones, y en todo el Mundo.\n\nQue expresión más sublime de la libertad democrática de expresión.\n\nPero volvamos al libro, crítico su introducción genérica, con múltiples citas, como las tesis doctorales que no aportan nada, y nada, que hay de valor añadido en lo expresado.\n\nConocí a las teorías de Kissinger cuando era estudiante de Ingeniería y sus famosos postulados sobre las negociaciones.\nTodo humo, un super extraordinario vendedor de crecepelos, pero aportar conocimiento para distinguir líderes de los que no lo son o enseñanzas de aquellos que lo son o lo han sido para otros que los quieran ser , Nada , nada de Nada.\n\nBueno y en los incluidos meter a Richard Nisson, el que le pagó el sueldo y todos sus libertinajes, el que se cargó el patrón Oro, y que a su lado \" Al\" era un chico del Colmado, vamos hay que tener cara.\n\nEste es mi resumen del libro : no aporta conocimiento, no elige auténticos líderes, obviar a Reagon o Mao , como ejemplo negativo, es hacer un brindis al Sol e ignorar la Realidad Histórica. Y para colmo el ejemplo de Egipto , las herencias de otro de sus líderes políticos.\n\nNo merece la pena perder el tiempo leyendo este libro y eso que me lo ha recomendado alguien al que sigo siempre Don E. N de L.D\n\nPor último para completar el análisis destacar que el texto en inglés está demasiado latinizado, lo cual interpretó como un deseo de aparentar expresión de cultura, cultura que no he encontrado en el libro.\n\nLo dicho, no merece la pena, no enseña nada, muchos latinazos para aparentar altura pero a la postre un \" crecepelos \"\n\nLo siento de verdad.",
    "This is Kissinger's last book. But it is easily the first of Kissinger's books that you should read. Especially the chapter on Richard Nixon. This is where the more mature Kissinger as author makes his role as diplomat subservient to the main leadership role played by Nixon as President.\nAlso, this book is a primer to reading other more complex books on diplomacy by Kissinger himself and also educates you in the first steps of reading about diplomacy to appreciate other books by other diplomats of the USA."

    "This is a time of apocalyptic claims, from climate change and the collapse of capitalism to political extremism. Are we facing the end of our civilization? Is there any reason to hope? What should we do? What suggestions are utopian? I cannot imagine what it’s like for the young people just beginning to seek perspective about these seemingly existential issues. That’s why this book could be of immense value: it offers a scientist’s perspective that is without the over-heated rhetoric or utopian fantasies, supported by hard data, and long-term historical context. You just have to persevere through the numbers and dry style to the wisdom and commonsense beneath.\n\nCivilization as we know it, Smil states, is a recent phenomenon. For the first time, we have moved beyond a subsistence economy and enjoy greater leisure time than our ancestors; we live, in a sense, better than the elites throughout all previous human history. In the last 200 years, we have harnessed chemical power – essentially the fossil fuels – to replace muscle work, leading to an economic transformation that raised living standards to unprecedented heights, linking everyone together. The downside, which Smil emphasizes was recognized long ago, is that we are heating the atmosphere, which requires global cooperation to remedy; this is a far more difficult and uncertain task that is commonly acknowledged.\n\nSmil sees 4 man-made “pillars” of the modern world. First, there is ammonia, which serves as a fertilizer to replace soil nitrogen. This enabled a massive increase in population, enhancing the efficiency of agriculture to such a degree that only a tiny portion of the human population are now farmers. Second, plastics, lightweight and very strong, are one of the principal materials in the products we use. They are versatile and easily molded, if also a growing environmental problem. Third, steel serves as a building material in both our products and architecture. Fourth, concrete shapes our landscape and environment with unprecedented ease that is long lasting and durable.\n\nThe basis of all this is fossil fuels, which account for approximately 85% of our energy requirements. It will, according to Smil, require unprecedented investment to convert out of them and so far, there is nothing on the horizon that can realistically do so. Not solar, wind, or any other technologies imaginable. Moreover, we operate in a global economy, where travel, transport and communications have shrunk the world, mingling cultures, societies and individuals in far more intimate ways than was hitherto possible. We are all interlinked, which means that to do anything impacting the planet, we will have to act together, which we are not yet prepared to do.\n\nFor anyone who has read the newspapers carefully, none of this will appear entirely new. Of course, this will be a great book for my son, who is only beginning to become interested in current events. He is ready to absorb this and it could bring a life-changing awareness to him as he enters his career as a medical doctor. Furthermore, even the well versed will gain a sense of proportion – how all of these issues and limits fit together, what is possible and what isn’t, what the magnitude of the risks really are, all in historical context. I certainly learned many new things in that way in this book.\n\nRecommended. It can be a fascinating read at its best, though much of it is somewhat dry, and it requires a certain comfort level with numbers, a step towards numeracy.",
    "Vaclav Smil educates the reader by explaining how interwoven the use of fossil fuels is with the functioning of modern society. He adeptly discusses the challenges with replacing fossil energy with the current generation of renewables (such as PV, wind, the out-of-favor nuclear, and nearly tapped out hydro) due to the scope of the existing infrastructure. This infrastructure cannot be replaced in a decade or two. He also discusses that energy is only part of the problem. Significant levels of greenhouse gasses are emitted in producing other basic inputs to modern civilization including cement, fertilizer, and plastics. Further, the world population is growing in size and the poor nations will demand access to increased energy and basic inputs to improve their quality of life - or in the case of food - even survive. Because of these challenges, we will not achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Proposed massive increases in carbon capture are unrealistic. The goal of 1.5C rise is realistically already behind us, and it appears we will go well beyond 2C.\nNo worldwide binding agreement on limiting greenhouse gasses is in effect, and nations are unlikely (in many cases) to meet their Paris accord agreements, and with increases expected in China, India, and Africa, emissions will continue to rise even if they did.\nIt’s a challenging, but realistic, assessment of the challenges ahead. Smil is not saying our efforts to decrease greenhouse gasses are not warranted. He is not suggesting we should slow them down. He is suggesting that the problem is more challenging, and much longer term than we are being sold.\nOne suggestion to the author - There is an almost complete lack of graphs and charts. They would be a powerful addition to visualizing and internalizing the many detailed comparisons you make.",
    "This book seems so objectively written that it is difficult to challenge the conclusions. In 30 years of talking about climate change what has the world governments actually accomplished? We will still be using fossil fuels for a very long time and if we aren’t it won’t be because of the hype around cataclysmic global climate change but because a better, more energy-dense substitute is invented or discovered which is not very likely. The link between natural gas, nitrogen fertilizer and feeding the world makes a strong case for the continuing utilization of processed nitrogen fertilizer from natural gas. Or leaving half the world to starve.",
    "A multifaceted helicopter view on vital planetary issues by a knowledgeable jack of all trades.\nImportant to realise that there are no quick fixes to replace fossils in short term. This notion is the prerequisite to start acting to urgently replace them.\nPlastic lifecycle is missing the grave: where do polymers end up: nanoplastics everywhere and as fumes through incineration. More vigorous analysis on cement grave also missing.",
    "Enlightening. Ever thought of how much petroleum is in a pound of babanas, or how large a fueling station would have to be to meet current demand if all cars went electric? This book will enlighten and maybe frighten you! Higly recommended.",
    "The data and arguments presented compel readers to think about ideological beliefs and challenge them with data. The point is repeatedly emphasized in the book that data is presented, not projections or ideologies. Cement, steel, ammonia and plastics - necessities of modern world are very well elaborated. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "It is important for everyone to understand what factors are driving the world’s economies. This is particularly so when there are concerns about global warming and the alleged degradation of the environment as the world’s population continues to increase.\n\nA good primer on this subject this recently published book by Prof. Vaclav Smil entitled “How the World Really Works”. The author covers wide ranging topics from energy supply to food supply in a very analytic way based on established facts rather than polemics which he criticises as being far too common in the modern world.\n\nHis chapter on food production is particularly interesting and he shows how we now manage to feed 8 billion people reasonably well which would have been inconceivable 100 years ago. How do we do it? By using energy supplied mostly from fossil fuels to create fertilizers and by manufacturing farm machinery and road/rail/shipping transport to distribute the products efficiently. The author points out that if we reverted to solely “organic” farming methods we would be lucky to feed half the world’s population.\nHe covers the supply of key products such as steel, plastics and cement which are essential for our modern standard of living and how they are not only energy intensive in production but that there are few alternatives. He clearly supports the view that the climate is being affected by man’s activities but points out that the changing of energy production, food production and the production of key products cannot be easily achieved. Certainly it will be difficult to achieve that in the timescales demanded by European politicians when the major carbon emitters of China, India, USA, and Russia are moving so slowly.\n\nThe author looks at the risks in the future for the world, many of which are uncertain. He mentions the risk of a big “Carrington event” - a geomagnetic storm occurring today would cause widespread electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage due to extended outages of the electrical grid. If that is not enough to scare you he suggests that another pandemic similar to Covid-19 is very likely as such epidemics have happened about every 20 years in the past and might be more virulent in future. But planning for such events, which were historically well known, was minimal and continues to be so.\n\nHe does not propose solutions to global warming other than that we do have many tools to enable us to adapt and cope with the issue. For example, farming could be made more efficient and wasted food reduced. Electrification of vehicles might help in a minor way and he is particularly critical of the increase in the use of SUVs in the last 20 years which has been particularly damaging. But this is not a book containing simple remedies to the world’s problems. It is more one that gives you an understanding of how we got to where we are now and where we might be going.\n\nAltogether the book is worth reading just to get an understanding of how the world currently works – as the book’s title suggests.",
    "Hard to mark this. It contains loads of important information and, thank heavens, it's not ideologically slanted and is gloriously intelligent. But my God it's a hard read, with some absolute litanies of tedious facts and numbers. It's certainly a bit of a slap in the face for the naive idealists who imagine that we are on the verge of this gloriously green international culture and that loads of things will be \"solved\" by 2040 or that we will be \"doomed\" by then, when neither is the case in fact, if you look at enough things rationally. Ever looked at, and inside, a hospital, which is a monument to steel and cement and plastics? Think we are close to replacing any of those items? The world uses billions of tons of them every year, and it's impossible to extract/supply/manufacture these things without fossil fuels, using existing technological and scientific knowledge. Yes, humans cope with problems, and measures are constantly being invented and worked on. But there ain't any magic wands, and the pronouncements of, say, Greta Thunberg, as well-intentioned as she was, will not turn her into the Dark Angel of the Apocalypse. She will, I hope, still be here in twenty years' time, but armed with a lot more facts to engage her intelligence - as well as with what has been possible, and impossible, in twenty years of progress.",
    "Top line: a highly recommended read.\nSmil's mission is to tell us that hopes of a rapid and easy transition into a \"net-zero\" future or a world where AI has solved all our problems are pipe dreams, and in this he is a complete success. It's all a salutory reminder that the physical - and not the virtual - world is what really matters and that the material changes of the last 20 years are enormous and not something that can be rolled back quickly and easily.\nHappily Smil is not some climate-change denying crank, so we are definitely in a discourse about why change needs to happen as well as how difficult it is.\nBut I also think he is maybe too pessimistic: the very scale and scope of China's economic transformation in the last 40 years - which Smil correctly describes as fundamental for all humanity - shows that human will and determination can achieve great things. Maybe not to the arbitrary targets of a \"year ending in 5 or 0\" but that is not a reason not to try - and sometimes this book does read as though he thinks it might all be a bit hopeless - certainly some of its readers are going to quote it as though he is making that argument.\nIn other ways the book feels like it is using excuses to avoid facing up to bad news. Yes, models are never likely to be anything close to perfect predictors of the future, but why are they cited with approval when it comes to estimating how much of certain future resources are available (when it suits Smil's argument) but (sometimes mockingly) dismissed when it comes to the impact of climate change? Facing up to hard reality also means facing up to the unavoidable damage that is yet to come.\nThe chapter on risk is very interesting but feels oddly out of place in the book's narrative. Something the author wanted to get off his chest in the middle of the pandemic?\nAll in all I do strongly recommend this book, but nullius in verba.",

    "I read this book in almost one sitting. Though I don't live in South Dakota, and I've only been there twice, I love that state, and I love that a truly honest conservative is the governor of it. Kristi represents everything great about America and Americans, the people who work hard to make this the most blessed land in the entire world. I am so worried we are losing that gratitude for this great country - there are far too many people looking to destroy America. Even I have had doubts about our future. Even I have felt shame about how there's very little left of the pride we used to have for our country. Too many think that conservatives are hateful and divisive, but we are the ones who want everyone in this country to be happy and successful, and we know that won't happen with leaders who care nothing for us and despise us because we have the power to think for ourselves and make the decisions that are best for ourselves and our families and yes, our country - and not rely on some bureaucrat who only believes in ideas they throw around in the faculty lounge at the Ivy Leagues; ideas which never work - they just think they haven't gotten the right people in charge of implementing them. Kristi Noem proves that caring, truly caring about those you govern and implementing conservative principles to GUIDE and LEAD (not threaten and coerce) is when America is in its finest moments. The best is yet to come!",
    "I highly recommend this book. 1. If you are a girl, Kristi Noem is a wonderful role model. As a parent of a girl, you want your girls to read this. SD's first female governor has lots of positive advice. She is a champion for women's rights to \"equal\" opportunities. 2. If you are a Christian, you will find this inspirational. Kristi does not preach, she lives the Word of God. She points out her failings and how God has called her on them. 3. If you are not a Christian, skip over the Biblical quotes but do try to grasp the message she learned from them. We'd have a much better world if we could all be \"teachable\" by at least listening and hearing other points of view and experiences regardless of where their inspiration comes from. 4. If you love our country, you will love it more through Kristi's eyes. She loves our country and the state of SD. 5. If you love freedom, you will feel hope. 6. If you grew up on a farm, as I did, you will relate to so many of her farm adventures and the rural way of life. If you eat. You are a part of the farming family. 7. If you are a hunter, you will relate to Kristi's love of hunting and her struggle to keep our freedom to own guns. 8. Sadly, the stress of this world had increased by division and radicalism. Do not believe the negative reviews. They are clearly people who belong to the \"cancel\" culture and Socialist far left. Kristi is all about moving forward into the future but also keeping traditions and cultures, including the Native American culture and history. She is about truth. If you want to know the truth, read the book.",
    "Why is this a must read book? Because it almost instantaneously puts the read in touch with what is so great and good about America. Governor Noem is an extraordinary human being, who, in keeping with what was once thought to be an American tradition, has risen from humble beginnings to the leadership role which she so clearly deserves. She is imbued with America's fundamental values, i.e. the 3 \"Fs\" - FAITH, FAMILY, AND FREEDOM.\nShe is a devout Christian, a devoted wife, mother, and family member, and a dedicated patriot, determined to serve her country and her State to the best of her ability (and brilliantly succeeding in all these endeavors) - she is a walking Statue of Liberty. Governor Noem is not just another pretty face (although she does have a very pretty face), she is the consummate citizen who takes her leadership role very seriously. She is exactly the type of leader that our Founding Fathers had in mind when they put what was once our great country together (unfortunately, \"wokefulness\" has fundamentally altered America, and if not stopped, threatens to destroy it altogether).\nWhat this country sorely needs is politicians like Governor Noem - people with content, character, and courage, unlike the pack of hacks and empty suits who now fill our Federal and State legislatures, governorships, and Courts. Our Founding Fathers went to Philadelphia wealthy and safe; they left less wealthy and in considerable danger.\nToday a bunch of mediocrities and dirt bags (think Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff) go to D.C. and other locales possessed of modest means and come back wealthy - on your dime (having accomplished little if anything of value for the citizens they are supposed to have served).\nKristi Noem was the first female governor of South Dakota. With any luck she will be the first female president of the U.S. She would definitely have my support in this endeavor should she choose to go down this path!!\nKen Eliasberg",
    "Loved the stories about attempted cow wrangling, truck driving, and mad mama cows! Also seeing Teddy Roosevelt's glasses up close and personal via helicopter. There are many laugh out loud moments in this book. I also appreciated Kristi's candid life story and rock solid beliefs in God. The analogies to politics were hilarious! She has wisdom, common sense, and her personality comes through as trustworthy . Those of you in S. Dakota are blessed to have her leadership. It certainly made me interested in visiting her state as I learned more about it through her descriptions.",
    "Excellent Read. Not a lot of politics . However the connections that the author has with politicians on both sides are remarkable. She is respectable which is rewarding. A caring women that makes since. A marvelous family background that has given her the emotional groundwork that exhibs respect, hard work and dedication to all of the people has had contact.\nA great read !\nallison",

    "This book was recommended by a co-worker. I am in data visualization/business intelligence and this definition helped advance my career. My improvement on my dashboard were apparent to me right away and was recognized by others through feedback.",
    "I'm new to project leadership so I've been trying to read at least one book about managing, data, and design every month to get fresh ideas about how to do my work and where to take my career (hence my new Goodreads shelf, tech-boss-babe-reading-list). STORYTELLING WITH DATA went on sale recently for $4.99 and I decided to snap it up since graphs and charts aren't exactly my strongest point as someone who tends to be more verbal and less mathematically inclined.\n\nSome of the complaints for this book are that it teaches the basics. That might be disappointing for people who take to this sort of thing easily or have been doing it for years, but for newbies like me, it's really great. I like how the author included \"before\" and \"after\" examples, as well as examples of what \"good\" and \"bad\" displays of data look like.\n\nMy one complaint is that she doesn't really talk about tools. She says it's to make the stuff he talks about more relevant to everyone, by keeping things simple, and she does link to templates and other sources that give more in-depth how-tos with specific software, but I guess I was kind of hoping for a \"Graphing on Excel for Dummies\" checklist, so I will admit to being a little disappointed.\n\nOverall, though, this has some really great lists of what to do and what not to do and it will help people who do not think abstractly or mathematically tell \"stories\" with data in a way that makes sense.\n\n3.5 to 4 out of 5 stars",
    "There is some good stuff in here.\n\nI like Knaflic’s focus on intentionality. For her, the defaults are something that should be avoided, or at least justified.\n\nI like how she looks at the presentation of graphic information as a story arc. There is one thing that you want to focus on to create actionable decisions. This is best, as she describes, if you are presenting. There are limitations if you have a static document that has information for multiple stakeholders.\n\nThe book is accessibly written with a clean font and plenty of examples.\n\nHowever, I do have to push back a bit. She follows Tufte in trying to eliminate data ink. Part of the intentionality is that you have less and less information on the page and every thing you includes helps tell your story. For me though that leads to a sameness. You want your audience to not have to think so hard. You want to make sure they don’t have their eyes glaze over. But that means that everything is very simple with a muted palette. The author notes that some of these are just her preference, but the mode of thinking has become influential. Part of me wants my audience to do some work in understanding the text I put in front of them. It means a level of engagement that I worry a too-simple graph leaves out.",
    "Don't just show data, show a story. This book has really challenged my preconceived ideas and years of linear thinking. Data shows a story and this explains how to draw that story out in a meaningful way.",
    "I’ve made a career in analytics, report writing, and visualization. This book helps me keep the mechanics in perspective and offers a great guide to best practices.",
    "Good quality, clean, like new book",
    "Essential, mandatory, elemental, critical, indispensable.",
    "One of the best story telling books I’ve bought so far. The examples included are practical and easy to understand. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who’s looking to improve their story telling skills or data visualization skills",
    "Don’t be fooled by the title. It’s not about visualising business information and modelling it’s about visualising KPIs. I’m sure it’s a fine book. Just not what I wanted.... it’s bar and line charts not how to tell a story using the core data. My fault. Didn’t do my homework!",
    "I was recommended this book, but unfortunately, it doesn't live up to expectations. This will be helpful for you if you have no common sense and have never met a good graph before. If you're looking to improve from creating basic graphs, this won't help you. The overviews of the different graph types were basic, I would argue many of the author's examples of a 'good graph' could still be improved, she tries to argue pie charts are rubbish through showing an awful 3D pie chart, then explaining 3D in itself is rubbish (duh!). Then also tries to argue for ethics in data on the principle that you shouldn't mislead because you'll be figured out by a smart audience member (not because it's principally wrong). Big book with big text, not much substance and will be reselling. Would highly recommend 'Better Data Visualizations' by Jonathan Schwabish instead.",
    "If your job is to talk with people about numbers (any numbers: profit and loss, salary, election results, number of stars in the universe) then this book is for you. If you have created a chart to explain something, but not sure if people will understand what you're trying to tell them then this book is for you. If you work with Excel, Power BI or any other tool to visualize data, don't stop on readying books about ETL and Power Query, Excel formulas, data modeling and DAX. ETL, data modeling, formulas/calculations - all this steps you're doing for one reason - to make it possible and easy for you or other people to get useful insights from the data. To make data easy to understand, to extract useful insight you need to visualize the data. To visualize the data doesn't mean to drag&drop data fields onto a chart. It means to make meaningful visual representation of the data. And you need to read good books about data visualization to understand the concepts. And this is the first book to read. Easy to read book based on real life examples. This books will help you understand why colorful visualization is not the same as insightful visualization, why you need to think carefully about each line, each caption, each color on your data visualization. After reading this book you'll be crying looking at the thousands of colorful pie charts (with tens of similar size sectors colored using all possible colors) posted in the internet by people who know how to create a chart using a software, but don't understand (yet) what is the purpose of this data transformation into a visual object. Read the book, and make the world of data visualization better. If you need more practice, read another book of the same author - \"Storytelling with Data: Let's Practice!\". Cole is a great teacher of the science (and art) called data visualization.",
    "It is difficult (if not impossible) to manage what cannot be measured. Yes, there are “intangibles” (e.g. empathy) that have unique value and importance. Quantifying the so-called “soft skills” (e.g. listening) also poses challenges. However, the fact remains that data visualization can enrich and extend a narrative’s impact, especially when the objective is persuasion or resolution rather than entertainment.\n\nWhat Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic provides in this volume is an abundance of information, insights, and counsel that can help almost anyone to master the skills needed, in Knaflic's words, “to visualize data and tell stories with it” in order to turn the data “into information that can be used to drive better decision making.”\n\nThese are among the several dozen passages of greatest interest and value to me, also listed to suggest the scope of Knaflic’s coverage:\n\no Thinking like a designer (Pages 15-16 and 127-150)\no Importance of context (19-33)\no Selecting visuals that will be effective (35-69)\no Graphs (43-49)\no Bar charts (50-59, 156-158, 161-162, and 236-237)\no Visuals to avoid (61-68)\no Voiding clutter (71-98)\no Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception (74-81)\no Lack of visual order (81-86)\no Focusing on an audience’s attention (99-126)\no Preattentive attributes (102-116)\no Affordances (128-138)\no Hierarchy of Information (135-138)\no Accessibility (138-145)\no Storytelling (165-185)\no Storytelling with data process (187-205 and 242-255)\no Case Study 2: Leveraging animation in the visuals you present (210-218)\no Case Study 4: Strategies for avoiding the spaghetti graph (227-234)\n\nI agree with Knaflic: “There is a story in your data. But your tools don’t know what that story is. That’s where it takes you — the analyst or commentator of the information — to bring that stay visually and contextually to life. That process is the focus of this book.”\n\nThese are the specific learning objectives on which she focuses, each preceded by “How to….”\n\no Understand the context in which the story is presented\no Select an appropriate visual display of the data\no Eliminate clutter\no Focus attention where it is most needed\no Think like a designer\no Tell the story (setting. characters, plot, conflicts, resolution, etc.)\n\nPresumably Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic agrees with me that the most effective storytellers are aware of an unspoken question that every member of the given audience has in mind: “Why should I care?” or perhaps “What’s in it for me?” The story format will help to engage their interest but there must also be substantive support of the message. That’s where the data component is decisive, for better or worse. If you need help with creating visualizations “that are thoughtfully designed to impart information and incite action,” look no further.",
    "Cole's first book, Storytelling with data, forms the base for her 2nd and 3rd books (storytelling with data - let's practice & storytelling with you - coming September 2022).\n\nThe lessons ask us to focus on our audience and context. Help us to choose an appropriate visual, discuss the need to eliminate clutter from the visual, and sharpen the focus and attention of the audience bearing in mind the need to prevent your audience from trying to figure out the visual whilst not listening to your presentation. Finally, UI/UX followers will appreciate the authors' encouragement of us to think like a designer and tell a story.\n\nVisualizations can be tricky, without the Cole makeover, they are open to interpretation, and invariably different audience members will arrive at different takeouts from the standard run-of-the-mill bar and pie charts. Creating a different visual and explaining the story to the audience is demonstrated clearly in the book. You can practice with the follow-on book - Let's practice. Take time, read the lessons, think about previous visualization experiences, and read more. Then practice! Appreciate the difference between graphs for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an explanatory graph.\n\nI enjoyed and valued the purchase which I often open and refer back to whilst doing a data visualization as part of my presentation decks."

    "Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a man born into wealth, with a strong family name and ambition to go as high as he would want to. The problem that FDR had was the same problem 99% of our current politicians have, he could not relate to the average person. We have millionaires in Congress now who own several homes, yachts and have never gone to the grocery store or filled their car with gas.\nWhen FDR was young and moved in political circles he knew he wanted to help people but he really had no idea what that really meant. So, he won some elections and lost some but never really lived up to his goal.\nThen he was struck with polio. At that time we did not have vaccines to protect us from polio and if someone contracted it more than likely they would end up paralyzed. So it was with Franklin. After he got the disease he was on either his back or barely walking with braces. In those first few years he really believed that he would get better, that he would be able to walk again. Everything else up to that point had always turned out fine so he had no reason to believe that this would be any different. But it was different and that difference changed who he was and how he viewed other people who had hardships. He was finally able to do something that politicians then and now we’re unable to do and that is to relate to the common man. Their hardships, their frustrations and their feeling of not being valued.\nToday we hear millionaires tell us that we should pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, to get off our butts and make something of ourselves and that if we are poor it is our own fault. In the late 20’s and through the 30’s Americans could not pull themselves up by their bootstraps because most of them could not afford boots. Millions of Americans did not have jobs, food lines were forming and the government was afraid of being called Socialist so they refused to help in anyway. Banks were closing, the stock market had drastically dropped and people had no where to turn. No health insurance, no insurance on their bank deposits, nothing that anyone could fall back on.\nThis was a job for someone that could understand the plight of the people. That person was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He knew what it felt like to be powerless, to not be able to change his situation no matter how hard he tried.\nFDR was two different people. One before polio and one after contracting the disease. The one after was someone humbled and very aware of pain and suffering.\n“Becoming FDR” by Jonathan Darman shows us these two men. The author breaks it down by years leading up to the point when he gets the disease and then who he becomes after. The book also provides the reader with context surrounding those years so we have a better understanding of both FDR and those around him. There are a lot of good books on FDR and most if not all will cover this part of his history but this book exclusively deals with him and the transformation he makes due to contracting polio.\nIf you are interested in FDR, the 20’s through the 30’s, how politics operated during that time or how one man can turn his misfortune into saving a nation, then this is a great book to pick up.",
    "This isn't so much a biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as it is a prelude to his presidency. Most of the focus is on his battle with polio and how he used this challenge to shape himself into the man we look back upon today.\n\nI knew a fair amount about FDR going into this book, but I'd never known about his life before his illness to such a great extent as illustrated here. Though to begin with the pacing is strange, going back and forth between different eras of both his and Eleanor's lives, towards the middle it finds steady footing, telling the story in a more linear timeline. Becoming FDR is an up close and personal account of life in the Roosevelt home through infidelity, illness, and politics.\n\nThere are also some mentions of those involved with the Roosevelts, such as Theodore Roosevelt, Louis Howe, friends of Eleanor's (among others), as well as quotes from Franklin and Eleanor's children. These interactions paint a broader picture of FDR through his social circle and family.\n\nInformative and a relatively quick read, this book is a great accent to history book collections.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Random House for providing a free digital ARC to read and review.",
    "I’ve read more than 50 books on the Roosevelt family, some of them good, some of them great, some of them hyper-focused on a short period of time, some of them sweeping sagas covering their entire lives. I’ve watched Ken Burns The Roosevelts 7-part series about 75 times in the past 8 years. But I’ve never read a book that focused on Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s battle with polio and how that shaped him as a man who could be president.\n\nDarman writes a compelling book, even though I’m very familiar with the subject and many of the stories told I was already familiar with. FDR spent most of his life as a privileged, charming, elitist lightweight whose only suffering was the loss of his father when he was 20. His mother pampered him babied him, bathing him until he was 9 years old. Sara Delano Roosevelt was a hovering mother who thought her child could do no wrong; her world revolved around Franklin. Having such devoted attention to oneself made Franklin very self-assured, if a bit shallow.\n\nGetting to know his fifth cousin, Eleanor, changed Franklin Roosevelt. She was a woman of substance despite her seemingly privileged upbringing. Having a shallow mother prone to headaches and an alcoholic father meant that Eleanor did not have the same safe, sheltered early life. Her parents and one of her two brothers died when she was 9 and 10, leaving her orphaned. Raised by her maternal grandmother, she lived with uncles who liked to drink too much and shoot at people walking outside the house. Three padlocks were installed on her bedroom door to keep the uncles out. It was at finishing school when Eleanor was 15-18 that she learned of a life of service. She often volunteered to help out the less fortunate and introduced Franklin to the poor living conditions of some of New York’s residents.\n\nBut that didn’t make Franklin any less carefree, and his privilege led to careless acts. He was ambitious and hoped to follow his distant cousin, and Eleanor’s uncle, Theodore, to the White House. But he had an affair with Eleanor’s former social secretary, Lucy Mercer, and was rarely around for his five surviving children (one child died at aged 7 months.) Eleanor said she’d give him a divorce, but his mother chimed in and said if he got a divorce, she’d cut him off financially. So they remained married, a political partnership with affection, but no longer love.\n\nFranklin was nominated for Vice-President on the Democratic ticket for President in 1920 with James Cox but lost in a big way. However, he knew that the exposure he got from the race, and the name recognition, as well as the choices he made in the future could point him toward the presidency.\n\nIt was the summer of 1921 when Franklin was stricken with infantile paralysis, polio, and his life forever changed. Unlike many who had gotten the disease, Franklin was never to regain his ability to walk. But he and his team of conspirators weaved a web of deception to the American public, making it seem he was on the mend. Through the next 11 years, Franklin learned to “walk” with leg braces, a cane, and firmly clutching the arm of a helper, usually his son James. No one ever saw him in a wheelchair.\n\nThe trials and tribulations of Franklin’s “wilderness years” are explored in detail. It was through his suffering that he finally got some empathy for his fellow man and made him the man who could be president. Just like his cousin Theodore’s trip to the Badlands following the death of his wife and mother made him the man who was one of the most popular and effective Presidents of all time, the fight to regain his ability to walk and talking to other polio patients made Franklin President material.\n\nThis was a really good read, making familiar material fresh, and revealing some stories that I had never heard before about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. And to think, the general public never knew he was a cripple. It’s sad to say that I don’t think the American public would elect a person with a disability today, just like they wouldn’t back in the 1930’s and 40’s. Considering the many attacks by Republicans about Franklin’s mental state (they claimed that the polio virus had damaged his brain as well as his body), I’m fairly surprised that the accusations didn’t stick, as they would in this day and age. And what we ended up with was the third best president of all time (behind Lincoln and Washington.)"

It equips us to be warrior brides that we need to win the race. This is a race for our eternal blessings and protection of ourselves and loved ones as well as our communities.

    "Firstly the negative. Why oh why is this called \"A woman's battle plan ...\" The book does not deal specifically with issues which affect only women, and I, as a chap did not have to skip over any sections because they didn't apply to me. The positives: this is a well written book. Short, punchy chapters written with humility and passion. Priscilla is a gifted communicator, but the book is not about her. She points you always to God, and uses Scripture to help direct you to draw up Strategic Prayers. My prayers could not fit on the small cardboard pull out cards at the rear; maybe some day! I loved this book and would highly recommend it to men and women. You do not have to watch War Room first, but it would help.",

A stample for prayer. Did exactly as she describes... using it to the point that it will become worn out.",
    "It's so interactive. Best book read in a long time. It's real, personal it's current. Love it. You think about the book when you put it away it. You just want to know what's next. If you are busy like me it's a good book to shut away with.",
    "If you want a book that helps you pray into every aspect of your life and the life of people around you, this one stirs you right up. Fantastic",

    "Let me start with what Malcolm Gladwell believes happened in the Sandra Bland case. During the 1970s, there was an experiment conducted in Kansas City, Missouri, which found that increased police patrols had no effect on crime. During the 1990s, a similar experiment, again conducted in Kansas City, instead targeted extra police patrols in very specific high-crime areas - and by very specific I mean city blocks, not streets, blocks. That experiment was incredibly effective and demonstrated that stopping individuals for very minor traffic infractions led to an increase in arrests, gun seizures, drug seizures, and, most importantly, crime.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies around the country took notice; sadly, they walked away with the wrong lesson. The officer who stopped Sandra Bland that fateful day had been trained to stop potentially suspicious individuals for very little reason. He was further trained to look for evidence of guilt rather than assuming anyone was just going about their business. Why? Because law enforcement agencies extrapolated and thought that what worked well in a very specific high-crime area would also work everywhere else. That just wasn’t the case. It led to an overly suspicious police force and, of course, the general populace growing increasing wary of encountering police. It also unfortunately disproportionately impacted African Americans and ultimately led to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nI am a HUGE fan of Malcolm Gladwell's work. He singlehandedly taught me to appreciate nonfiction. His books are both informative and entertaining, educational but really enjoyable to read. Outliers in particular has stuck with me. I also enjoyed his other books, not counting What the Dog Saw, which was a bit different from the others.\n\nIn any case, I have been looking forward to Talking to Strangers since I first heard of its upcoming release. It does not disappoint. I have a master's degree in anthropology, so Gladwell's own description of Talking to Strangers spoke to me immediately. After listing high-profile examples including Sandra Bland, Brock Turner, and Amanda Knox, Gladwell says: “In all of these cases, the parties involved relied on a set of strategies to translate one another's words and intentions. And in each case, something went very wrong. In Talking to Strangers, I want to understand those strategies—analyze them, critique them, figure out where they came from, find out how to fix them.”\n\nLargely using high-profile cases with which readers will be familiar, Malcolm Gladwell wants to teach us how to communicate better with those who are different. He presents us with two puzzles:\n\nFirst, why can't we tell when the stranger is front of us is lying to our face? (ANSWER: Because we default to truth. Society could not function otherwise. There don't just need to be red flags for us to recognize deception - there need to be an overwhelming number of them.)\n\nSecond, how is it that meeting a stranger can sometimes make us worse at making sense of that person than not meeting them? (ANSWER: Because we assume transparency, meaning we assume we can read their intentions on their faces and through their actions. It turns out, we can't. We're really bad at it.)\n\n“We have people struggling with their first impressions of a stranger. We have people struggling when they have months to understand a stranger. We have people struggling when they meet with someone only once, and people struggling when they return to the stranger again and again. They struggle with assessing a stranger's honesty. They struggle with a stranger's character. They struggle with a stranger's intent.\n\n“It's a mess.”\n\nIt is this mess which Malcolm Gladwell hopes to make more comprehensible.\n\nAs always, well written and highly readable. But I am dissatisfied with the conclusion. How do we best talk to strangers? \"What is required of us is restraint and humility.\" Sure. We need to acknowledge that strangers are complex and that we have no clue whether they are telling the truth or lying and that we certainly can not read their intentions from their facial expressions or actions. That's the humility part. The restraint part is recognizing all of that and not assuming we have a clue. But what Gladwell fails to do is actually give us a template of how to talk to strangers.\n\nTalking to people is confusing; the older I get, the more I recognize that. I have long since gotten that defaulting to truth can be problematic but assuming that everyone else is lying is worse. I don't have to look any further than neurodiversity to grasp that someone who fidgets or avoids eye contact may not be guilty of anything other than a diagnosis that is unknown to me. While this book was enlightening and informative on a large scale, on the minor scale that is my life, it did not teach me anything I did not already know in my quest to talk to strangers - and that is disappointing. I remain as bewildered as always by the other. And, I suppose, recognizing that already puts me ahead of the game.\n\nEDIT: I have continued mulling over this book, and one thing puzzles me. Gladwell says repeatedly in the first half of the book that the correct course of action is to assume others are telling the truth because lies are rare. But liars are not rare! As he demonstrated with the quiz experiment, when given the opportunity 30% of people cheated - and then lied about it! I suppose you could assume lies are rare if you also assume that most liars don't lie all the time. I prefer the maxim \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\"",
    "I haven’t had much of an attention span for reading in quite a while but I loved this and kept stopping to tell my husband what I had just read. I really like Malcolm Gladwell and really appreciate his open mind and keen curiosity about people and our behaviors. I think this book should be required education in schools. It dispels the common untrue beliefs we have about other people and their intentions. It’s a great book for understanding more about peacemaking.",
    "As Malcom Gladwell states, \"This book is a conundrum.\" Studies. actual events, etc. all lead to the conclusion that we miss identify cues from strangers that often ends with bad results. Although tone and word choice play a big part, policing is a treacherous job. This book offers insight into why so many arrests go bad.",
    "Gladwell manages to piece together seemingly unrelated horrific, tragic, questionable, and confusing events to find a common thread among them. While I don’t disagree with a common thread, I am still pondering the last chapter and what it all really means. What do we take away? What do I take away? It’s a similar feeling at the end of all Gladwell books. I’m glad to have known and pondered these different events in our recent history, and to have gained some skills for the critical thinking needed to get through future events.",
    "A good solid read that keeps you tuned in. It doesn't provide you with answers to a problem more than highlighting the problem and encouraging you to think deeply about it",
    "Malcolm Gladwell takes the reader through an interesting assortment of well known events to demonstrate how people reach the wrong conclusion about another person’s behavior during an event and often because of training that is not well founded. He provides information about well-known events that were not well known at the time of the event, resulting in a re-evaluation of your own conclusions about the event. Although this is an easy read, Gladwell guides the reader to some interesting theories. It’s worth the read.",
    "The book is fantastic however there are two topics that are very touchy. Be cautious if your school’s recommend this for students due to mature content.",
    "I love books that reveal the truth behind what we see and hear.",
    "Sorry, but I did not like this book. The best thing I can say is that it is well-written, very fluent and conversational as one would expect from a top New Yorker writer. I have never read anything else by Malcolm Gladwell as far as I know, but I was curious and even a bit excited to try this out because he is so well known for influential books such as The Tipping Point.\n\nHowever, I'm afraid this book has nothing to say. It is a compendium of interesting crime cases and celebrated moments from history and popular culture, ranging from Hitler to Friends to 9/11 and a whole load of controversial court cases, with some examination of suicide as a diversion. For the first half of it - and it's a very quick read, so do give it a try if you are inclined to doubt my criticism - I just found myself wondering: “where is he going with this? What is the thesis? What is his point?”\n\nOstensibly the book is about whether or not we can judge strangers. I think. But many of the examples that he draws on have no apparent lesson. Many of them are nice little vignettes which show how broad-ranging the author's mind is, and would make good “dinner party anecdotes” - but rather in a mansplaining vein, where you tell someone that what they think about Chamberlain and Hitler is so wrong because there's so much more to it... But actually they’re right.\n\nThere are digressions via Cuban spies, Bernie Madoff, Jerry Sandusky and Amanda Knox. All nicely told. But what does the book actually tell us? Sorry Mr Gladwell. I got nothing.",
    "**CONTAINS SPOILERS**\n\nThis is a thought-provoking book on the premise that the majority of people are unable to tell whether a stranger is trustworthy.\n\nThe author starts and ends with the true, tragic case of 28 year-old African American Sandra Bland, who in 2015 was pulled over by a traffic cop in Texas, arrested, and committed suicide in her jail cell three days later.\n\nChapters detail famous cases of the consequences of trusting – Montezuma and Cortes, Chamberlain and Hitler, spies undetected for years in high places. I couldn’t see the relevance of all the cases, for example the drunken rape case, interrogation methods and the Amanda Knox trials. A better example might have been the Lindy Chamberlain dingo case, to demonstrate how people mistrust innocent people whose body language does not match our expectations.\n\nGladwell asks “why can’t we tell when the stranger in front of us is lying?” He suggests that those recruiting, or judges setting bail, make better choices based on what they hear or read, rather than on who they are looking at. He also suggests that to keep society harmonious, we default to a position of trust.\n\nWe all know that those younger, prettier, taller, better dressed and educated – and in some cases whiter – have an advantage in life. I could add examples to the author’s, our former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman who was singled out in a first class carriage for a ticket check, the way the family of Stephen Lawrence were treated by the police.\n\nI was still struggling to keep up and follow the train of thought at the chapter on coupling, the theory that, for example, if someone wants to commit suicide and at the perfect and ideal time the perfect and ideal method presents itself they will go ahead, otherwise they might not carry out the act.\n\nI have read the transcript of the exchange between the cop and Sandra Bland and also watched a video of the exchange. The cop, who was rightly subsequently sacked, quickly became aggressive. But so did Bland – even the fact she lit a cigarette early in the exchange shocked me. These were two people with supressed anger and aggression, resentment, and preconceived judgements on both sides that escalated into disaster.\n\nIt turns out that the tragic Bland, who had a promising life ahead of her, had a troubled past. Certainly she should never have been pulled over, during an aggressive and unnecessary “stop and search” programme.\n\nI also struggle to place the incident in the context of life in America, living as I do in England. It seems a uniquely American encounter to me. I cannot imagine anyone lighting a cigarette when pulled over by the police unless wishing for further antagonism, and British cops do not – yet – carry guns. But we currently have the situation here where anyone criticizing a certain new royal princess for acting like a prima donna film star flashing her cash is called “racist” when please, look at her – olive skin and sleek straight hair. It’s nothing to do with her background – her sister in law got equal flack for her mother’s profession. It’s about behaviours and we need to carefully separate the two, and challenge our own and others preconceptions.\n\nMalorie Blackman politely challenged the ticket inspector: “Aren’t you going to check anyone else’s ticket?”. The family of Stephen Lawrence gained nationwide respect for their quiet dignity in their fight for justice. Sandra Bland was treated appallingly, humiliated and isolated, and she didn’t have the resources internal or external to overcome that treatment, spending her last days sobbing alone in her cell. A dreadful, damning example of policing gone awry. Perhaps she suspected she never would have found redress after release. This book, I hope, will in some way make up for that and I salute the author for it.",
    "Well-written, an easy read. Lots of interesting stories?\n\nBut, and it is a big but ...\n\nWhat is the point of the book? There don't seen to be any startling insights. The vignettes are over-used and repetitive. There's almost nothing on solutions. In conclusion, a shallow second-rate book. Pity ...",
    "Suppose all you wanted to say was “We should (also) accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers”, but you don’t have enough material to project it as a great idea, and you have to write a complete book about it, what would you do?\n\n1. You will research a lot of unrelated anecdotes and try to piece them together. Even if the association of a particular anecdote, with your book’s central idea, is at best tenuous, still you would try to twist it into the story.\n\n2. You will write it brilliantly. You will give away a sliver of a story here and another after a few pages and return to the story after a few chapters, trying to rise as many imaginary hairs as possible.\n\n3. Try putting the title of the book at weird places. It has to be reminded to the readers once in a while that the title has something to do with the book, and that the interesting unrelated incidents you are narrating are in fact, justifiably included.\n\n4. Of course, cash in your name, if it is popular enough. Spend some of the goodwill you generated previously by writing valuable books.\n\nIn summary, you try too hard. Malcolm Gladwell is guilty of the same crime.",
    "Somehow I was expecting rather more from this celebrated author. I am about halfway through and have found it to be a series of stories which make the same basic point. There is nothing intriguing to get your teeth into and have found the book shallow and very disappointing. Two stars is probably generous!"

    "*A Wrinkle of Time* is a sci-fi fantasy novel by Madeleine L'Engle. The story is in many respects similar to the type of fiction that one would expect of CS Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia*, in that much religious mythology and symbolism are used. In some ways, this is more blatant, and in other ways, less blatant, than the *Narnia* books.\n\nThe story is about a teenage girl named Meg Murry, whose father has been missing for several years. Originally on a research mission for the US government, the brilliant scientist (both Meg's parents are brilliant scientists) vanished. While the government says that he is \"serving his country\", the family is worried, and most of the small town where they live has assumed the worst. Despite their worry, the family insists that the father is coming back someday.\n\nThis seems to be a point of contention between the Murrys and the rest of the town. The rest of the town wants the Murrys to see the truth, as they think it is, and they also are put off by the Meg and her behavior. You see, while all of the Murry children are quite brilliant, Meg and her youngest brother Charles Wallace, are brilliant but troubled in that their quirkiness gets them weird reactions from folks.\n\nInto this situation come three strange older women, who look like typical, though extremely eccentric in their own right, senior citizens. But they are not. They know things no one else should. Things about the Murry family, Dr. Murry's (the vanished husband) research, and about everyone in general.\n\nThese three women, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who, take Meg, Charles Wallace, and their new friend Calvin, on a trip through realms of magic and science to another world, one where there father is trapped and held captive by an insidiously evil force. This force has turned many planets toward it's ends, and while it didn't seek out Mr. Murry, it now is unwilling to release him, or anyone else, it can get in it's grasp.\n\nThe question for Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace is whether they can save Dr. Murry. For that matter, can they even save themselves? Because while their new friends in the form of the entities called Mrs. Who, Which, and Whatsit are powerful, even they have limits and such, for what they can and can't do.\n\nI said at the beginning that this is both more, and less, blatant in it's religious imagery than the *Narnia* books. That is because while Lewis was writing as a (what he liked to call) \"supposal\" or a \"what if\" scenario, he largely stayed away from the actual words of the Bible. L'Engle, on the other hand, actually had the Scripture verses quoted quite often, and they seem to be words with power. Both authors stopped just shy of stating outright the biblical nature of the characters, though Lewis would quite quickly become more blatant, whereas L'Engle had the Scriptures quoted and other hints, but didn't outright state anything.\n\nIt's quite a contrast of approaches to story-telling with a theological and religious mythical framework. In the case of the Narnia books, the actions are done largely by God, and the characters,while important, are just there to perform actions until God saves the day. In L'Engle's books, or at least *Wrinkle*, God (through his angels obviously) still saves the day, but He and they leave the actions up to the characters to do what is necessary to save the day. I would probably liken this book to *The Silver Chair*, which is the most protagonist-centered and least Aslan-centered of the *Narnia* books.\n\nIt's interesting, because both approaches (God doing everything and the characters doing less, and the characters doing everything with God's help) are actually Scriptural in a way. In the end, God *does* do everything, because it is in His strength that we act, but *we* are supposed to take actions as well as God expects us to freely do good and avoid evil, with his help.\n\nDon't get the wrong idea. This is not a religious book, and one can avoid the religious overtones and easily still enjoy the premise. There's a lot of fun stuff. Friendships, interplanetary travels, fighting a totalitarian menace, so on. The religious themes are there, but are not \"in your face\", in other words. My reason for exploring the religious concepts is that a) such philosophical stuff interests me, and b) they are there so getting that discussion out of the way is necessary. It's necessary to both understanding some of the deeper meanings of the book if one wishes to do so, and to understanding the cosmology of the series as a whole, even if one doesn't want to focus on any real-life connections to Scripture. It's like how in *The Dresden Files*, Christianity has a role (as do many myths), but one needn't be a believer to understand and cheer, because those books are NOT Christian fic, but understanding these myths or the Christian cosmology used by the author helps understand the books better.\n\nThough brief, the authoress managed to give us some good characterization and sense of the cast, or the ones we spend much time with, at least. Meg is socially clumsy, self-conscious, and seems to not be bright via the school's standards. But she is, in fact, *brilliant*, and she is also loving, loyal, and kind, though also stubborn and prone to anger and other emotional extremes at times. These are part of who she is and not a bad thing (except the various emotional extremes bit), if they are channeled to good uses.\n\nCharles Wallace seems to be on a different wave length than everyone else and closer to the land of the beings like the entities known as Mrs. Who, Which, and Whatsit. He is also, especially for his age, surprisingly mature, kind, and thoughtful, not to mention brave and quick on his feet. His main fault though is his pride. He is more brilliant than most people, his family included, as shown by his insights into many areas. And he *knows* this. While he never acts arrogant and condescending to anyone else, his knowledge of his own extraordinariness causes him to be unduly confident in his own abilities, which causes a LOT of problems.\n\nCalvin is the most well-rounded character in that he is quite smart, though not nearly so much as the Murrys are, and very athletic for his age. He also is brave and empathetic to others, which given his very dysfunctional, and heartbreakingly so, home life is almost a small miracle. He doesn't have Charles amazing abilities, or any of the Murry's intelligence, but he has rhetorical skills, leadership qualities, is dependable, and has a strong will. He also is surprisingly insightful in ways that the uber-intelligent but quirky Murrys are not.\n\nMrs. Murry is sweet and kind, a good mother and a faithful wife who never gives up on her husband's return and holds the family together by her sheer force of will, personality and love. She doesn't have much of a presence, but she is impressive when we do see her. On top of all of this, she is a brilliant scientist herself who does experiments in her home laboratory while raising her children. She's pretty much super-Mom and super-scientist.\n\nMr. Murry I won't get into much because that is very spoilery about his appearances and what he does, who he is, so on. Suffice it to say that he is a good man whose families love and praise are realized mostly, but can never be as perfect as they have made him out to be in the years of his disappearance.\n\nBefore I close, as this review is getting rather longish, the system of a meld of science fiction and fantasy that L'Engle sets up here was impressive and fun. It's not hard sci-fi, by any means, but neither is it soft like *Star Wars* or *Star Trek*. It has some science fiction concepts and speculative ideas, but goes it's own way to engage the imagination and sense of awe of the reader, even where creative liberties occur. It's a fun and careful balance that L'Engle expertly maintained.\n\nFor such a thin volume, the authoress had a great deal of characterization, of carefully, though briefly explored, cosmology, and a fun adventure. I really did enjoy, and highly recommend, this story. I can't wait to read the future volumes in this series.\n\nRating: 5/5 Stars.",
    "If I had read Madeleine L’Engle’s book, A Wrinkle in Time when I was young, there’s a good chance I would have pursued a career in science. First published in 1962 before the concept of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) became a colloquialism for young women — a rallying cry, really — L’Engle’s book reads like a STEM Sisters manifesto, a how-to on being a girl and not being afraid to shine, even if it means being better than a boy in math or science. Today, a measly 12% of female bachelor students go into STEM careers, yet, I posit, that had more girls read A Wrinkle in Time as children, I’m pretty sure that number would be substantially higher. Did I mention that A Wrinkle in Time was rejected 26 times by different publishers until it was picked up by Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, because, as L’Engle has commented, it was “too different,” and she didn’t think anyone would publish it. It went on to win the distinguished Newberry Medal in 1963, http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberymedal, proving that people will embrace “different” if it comes in the right package.\n\nGiven the groundbreaking nature of the story, it’s wonder the book was even published: a female protagonist, the concept of evil which wasn’t kid’s book fodder in 1962, and so much science talk, that there was no precedent for any of it. Would we have Dr. Who (first aired in November 1963) or Star Trek (first aired in 1966) without A Wrinkle in Time? Is it possible that L’Engle’s little book kickstarted the sci-fi craze that the modern-day public clings to like a free climber in Acadia National Park?\n\nWe earthlings need to stretch our imaginations beyond this little blue orb and our activities of daily living in order to experience fulfilling lives. Music, art, philosophy and books, books, books help us answer the darn eternal questions that plague us such as who am I? and where the heck am I going? L’Engle planted the sci-fi seed in a generation of kids who grew up to be Star Wars fans and believe in the power of possibility. No small feat there. Yeah, Madeleine. You go, girl. While Scientists have yet to figure out the time travel thing, you can bet that books like A Wrinkle in Time sparked the imagination like no physics class ever could.\n\nL’Engle’s main character, Meg Murray, is a feisty firebrand of a girl who knows her way around a mathematical equation, but shrinks from the more traditional subjects that girls generally excel in. Meg’s brother, Charles Wallace, is a big genius hidden in the body of a small boy. When Meg’s dad goes missing while on a secret, scientific assignment for the government, Meg is distraught while Charles Wallace is busy gaining assistance from his secret contacts. When Mr. Murray doesn’t come back for almost a year, neighbors, teachers and friends all assume Meg’s dad ran off with another woman. Only Meg’s mom believes her husband is in danger; she works diligently in her lab — she’s a scientist, too — devising a way to bring him back.\n\nMeg loves her father and knows that the man who taught her so much about math and science would never willingly leave his family so she and Charles Wallace and their friend, Calvin set off with Charles Wallace’s friends — Mrs Whatsit, who drapes herself in layers of colorful clothes and is the primary intermediary for the kids, Mrs Who, who speaks in only quotations, and Mrs Which, the wisest of the three and usually appearing as a shimmering light because 3-D is just too darn dense — on a quest to find Mr. Murray and bring him back. Meg and company travel the galaxy, encountering many bizarre creatures, including the inimitable Aunt Beast, all of whom assist the young travelers on their journey.\n\nThanks to the assistance of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which, the crew finds Mr. Murray on the planet Chazmatazz, a dark foreboding place where independent thought is prohibited, where they are introduced to the Tesseract, a fifth-dimensional machine that allows you to jump through time, hence the wrinkle. The Tesseract is one amazing scientific advancement that the kids would love to learn more about, but with Meg’s dad being held in a bar-less prison, and Charles Wallace’s mind being taken over by It, there’s so little time to learn about all of the ramifications of time travel before they have to jump time again to make things right.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time has all the best components of a sci-fi novel — other worlds, a special relationship rooted in earth, making it impossible to leave for good; crazy characters who, although foreign to us, endear us with their actions; a lovable, flawed protagonist possessed of true grit, heart, and purpose, and at her core, a mind for science and math — which, despite what the current elected officials of the American political system have to say, is the reason modern man has effloresced and is still thriving today in the 21st century. (Recall that the ruling elite of the 17th century imprisoned Galileo Galilei, the father of physics and modern astronomy and arguably one of the greatest thinkers of all time for being too science-y and, hence, heretical. Plus it has one of the best (read: corny) opening lines of any mystery novel although the Washington Post Style Invitational attributes it firstly to English author Paul Clifford, circa 1830. And of course, we can’t forget Snoopy. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) Just sayin’.\n\nWant to get down with your hidden science side? Want to read a YA novel with big adult themes? Then read A Wrinkle in Time to see how it all got started and rekindle your childhood belief in worlds of possibility.",
    "This classic introduces that science can be an adventure in and of itself. Briefly introducing theories of quantum physics and reinforcing the power of love and family, this book brings Meg and her brother Charles on an adventure to rescue their father across parallel dimensions with the help of extradimensional beings. Their enemy is none other than entropy. And time is running out for their father.",
    "The book was a great read with lots of imagery. I was engrossed from start to finish.I would like to read more of her books",
    "Good little book. Light reading for anyone who likes to read.",
    "This was a refreshing story that reminds us to not judge a book by its cover. Most importantly, it was a wonderful reminder of the gift and power of loving and being loved.",
    "If I need to define A Wrinkle In Time in one sentence, it is a book for all times and for all ages. That’s why it’s a multiple award winner classic, and it was nothing less than my expectations.\nL’engle was inspired from Einstein’s theories in this book, and I’m not even sure I understand everything as an adult 🙂 It’s full of beautiful quotes, anecdotes, metaphors that elevates the book to another level than being a simple children’s novel. Meg, as a character, is layered and complex. When asked, L’engle if Meg is her, she says ‘of course’ 🙂\nThe evil is so realistic and scary. The atmosphere is very vividly dark. I loved how she displayed the battle between good and bad. My only criticism is, I felt the end was very rushed compared to the build up.",
    "At the back of the book is an interview with the author's granddaughter in which a publisher's reader comments 'I think this is the worst book I have ever read.' Well, I couldn't agree more.\n\nIt's not just because it's dated. The characters are nauseatingly prim and precocious, the 'magical' characters are, frankly, boring, and the the whole thing is a horrible and confusing mishmash of bad sci-fi, yawnworthy witches and mawkish religion. I shouted out loud a lot as I read this.\n\nA few of the central ideas feel a bit too similar to C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy series for my liking - for example, the severed head of Alcasan in That Hideous Strength is a mouthpiece for the evil alien Eldila, just like the throbbing brain is a mouthpiece for 'It' in A Wrinkle in Time. (By the way, the three Space Trilogy novels are far from the best thing Lewis ever wrote).\n\nI'd happily give this zero points. Makes me mad this book still in circulation when I see so many talented authors out there these days who can't get a break. It's mystifying how this was ever made into a film.",
    "Love - that is the main message of this book. Its complicated, and fragile. Its never simple. Meg the main protagonist is a girl who is different who doesn't quite fit in. The same can be said for Calvin and Charles. Yet all of them are beautiful people with deep flaws that you cannot help but like.\nThis is a strange, mysterious story which is also deeply spiritual. Yes, there is a Christian message but it is a message that all of us can understand. The darkness they face is so complete, Meg learns to both rely on others and battle alone.\nBeing different is what makes these characters. it is what makes us humans. And this book may just heal a little bit of IT inside us all. Our weaknesses can often be our strength.\nA fight between good and evil that can be enjoyed by all ages. It carries with a strong positive message.",
    "I bought this book knowing nothing about the story as it was recommended by a friend and was pleasantly surprised - I read it in one sitting over 3 hours or so and once I’d finished, I sat wishing I could read it again for the first time!\n\nWhile the story is relatively short and the writing style is simplistic at times, it isn’t at all dull to read - it’s relaxing and suitable for a wide audience (probably from around 11 upwards) and the characters (especially meg!) are relatable and appealing without being flawless\n\nI would describe the story as rather whimsical fantasy (it reminded me of a ghibli film in places) but not in a way that could put off older readers.\n\nOverall, a brilliant story and definitely worth the price!",
    "This is another fantasy novel for older children published in the early 1960s, though unlike the Alan Garner novel I read just before this, this one contains much more of a mixture of fantasy and science fiction ideas. Meg and her brother Charles Wallace and another boy Calvin meet three mysterious \"witches\" who go by the delightful names of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. In search of Meg and Charles's father, who disappeared a year ago while supposedly carrying out top secret government work, the children are then whisked off through the eponymous medium to another planet threatened by a mysterious dark force which also threatens the Earth. However, most of the action takes place on the planet Camazotz, ruled over by a disembodied brain which enforces total uniformity on its inhabitants in the name of guaranteeing order and happiness, which is quite a stark idea, opening up readers' minds to concepts of personal freedom and the potential price that can be paid for order and happiness (or at least, as here, an absence of unhappiness or pain, which is not the same thing at all). The children's characters are quite clearly delineated and more three dimensional than many child central characters in young people's literature. The ending was rather abrupt, though I understand the author went to write a quintet of these novels."

    "My first thoughts after reading this book were, “I am glad I am no longer an active college professor: I never could walk on eggshells!”\n\nAnd as Lukianoff and Haidt well present, college professors, today, are walking on eggshells. Many are afraid to live up to their university goals of teaching the truth as they see it. Furthermore, they are afraid to support their fellow professors who do try to teach honestly for fear of retribution.\n\nBut let’s back up: this book is not really about professors: instead, this book started as a serious observation that there is a rising rate of teen depression, anxiety, and suicides. But in the investigation of this problem, Lukianoff and Haidt discovered that this is but one of the outcomes. Among the other outcomes were the polarization of American politics, social injustices, and suppression of free speech, particularly on college campuses. And while Lukianoff and Haidt posit that these situations started in 2013 and continue today, I saw evidence of what is in the book as early as 2008 and perhaps even earlier at a state university. In other words, these didn’t just start with the “iGen” children coming of age at this time.\n\nGreg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt are well qualified to make such observations. Greg Lukianoff is the President of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. He has served in this position for more than a decade. Thus, he has been a keen observer of the challenges that people have had to face in American education. Jonathan Haidt is a Social Psychologist and a Professor at New York University. As a professor and social psychologist, he has first-hand experience with students as well the ability to understand the dynamics within these populations.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt present the case that there are three great “Untruths” that are underlying our treatment of youth today:\n\n1) What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.\n2) Always trust your feelings.\n3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.\n\nNote that the first is a perversion of Nietzsche’s famous dictum: “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” The second is favorite advice of many pop psychologists today. And the third is a simplistic view originating from religion: “us vs. them.” The authors present convincing evidence that these “Untruths” are active and lead to bad ideas of how to treat children.\n\nOne of the predominant themes, in this book, is that Cognitive Behavioral Psychology, CBT, presents valid tools by which to evaluate and rectify the situations which create harm from these Untruths in American society. I very much agree with the authors here. If I were to evaluate today’s political situations, the very distortions that CBT points out are active and frontmost in American polarization.\n\nThen Lukianoff and Haidt examine how intimidation and violence originate. A very quick synopsis is the quote they use from Nelson Mandela: “When we dehumanize and demonize our opponents, we abandon the possibility of peacefully resolving our differences, and seek to justify violence against them.” Here, the authors show how words have become defined as violence and the misguided concept that people need protection for their safety against speech that challenges their previously held conceptions. This then makes it possible for “witch hunts” to occur.\n\nThe features of witch hunts are they arise quickly, there are alleged crimes against society, the crimes are often fabricated, and the proponents of the witch hunts invoke fear into anyone trying to defend the accused. Witch hunts are used to generate mob cohesion and to create a “common enemy” to destroy.\n\nAs Lukianoff and Haidt show, witch hunts are occurring on US Campuses today in a “call out” mob mentality where the prevailing beliefs are challenged. Internally, it appears that the “call outs” are being made from the left while externally, the “call outs” are being made from the right. It is important to note here that 60% of the professorate is identified as being Far Left or Liberal while only 20% of the professorate is identified as Far Right or Conservative.\n\nSome of the witch hunts have been created by the professorate, themselves, in asking for condemnation of a professor who challenges their ideologies. Thus, it suppresses free speech as well as suppresses critical thinking. The witch hunts, particularly at universities where the leadership has been weak, has resulted in both harm to the employment of professors as well in some cases, direct violence to the professors. Other professors who might agree with an “outcast professor” stay silent as they fear the same thing might occur to them.\n\nThe authors observe a cycle of polarization. A typical “polarization cycle” looks something like this: First, a professor says or writes something that is interpreted as provocative or inflammatory, regardless of what the intent was. Then, an activist retells the story to amplify the outrage. Next, a multitude of people writes angry posts on social media and threatening emails to the professor involved. The college or university administration fails to defend the professor and may take steps to sanction the professor regardless of the rights of the professor. Lastly, people that hear the story distort it to fit their views as confirmation bias. Things are out of control, and each side views the other side as evil, thus negating any chance for de-escalation.\n\n“How did we get here?” Lukianoff and Haidt ask this very question. There appear to be six explanatory threads, but the threads do not affect everybody, and even amongst the people affected, the effects are different. The six identified threads are 1) rising political polarization, 2) rising teen anxiety and depression, 3) changes in parenting practices, 4) the decline of free play and the restricted opportunities for childhood independence, 5) the growth of a corporate campus bureaucracy, and 6) a rising passion for “social justice” for major events where the concepts of “justice” have been perverted. These deserve more treatment in this already long review.\n\nFirst, there has been a growing shift towards the left in the college professorate. With the controversial election of President Trump, the campuses have become hotbeds of resistive political activity, and this activity is inflicted on the student bodies. Thus, there is and continues to be “witch hunt” activity in the long practice of universities to bring to campus a diverse set of provocative speakers. The major reason for doing this is to expose the student body to diverse views and to create discussions leading to the use of critical thinking. Conservatives speakers invited on many campuses resulted in violent displays of resistance and then either harassed on campus to prevent them from speaking or disinvited to prevent further violence.\n\nSecond, the rising trend in teen depression and suicides has fostered an atmosphere of expectancy of depression amongst the student bodies on campuses. This trend is more significant with females than males, although very recent statistics show a sharp upturn for males as well. Much of this is attributed to the use of social media, which projects a distorted view of appearances and reality as well as creates in people the feeling of being left out of various activities. There also is a feedback mechanism at work here: students are more likely today than in the past to seek out mental health counselors for anxiety. As the mental health bureaucracy processes these visits, it may well suggest symptoms of mental unhealth. This is expanded on in the fifth thread.\n\nThird, parents have developed a fear of letting their children have unsupervised play. In part, some of this was caused by the highly publicized child abductions. Another factor in this has been the passage of child protection laws and the arrests of parents under those laws for letting their children be unsupervised. A culture of “safetyism” (that is, the child must be totally safe at all times,) has been built up and reinforced. There has been the observation that children seem to be growing up slower than in past years with regards to maturity. There are class distinctions: parents of the upper middle classes have the resources to involve their children in sophisticated activities such as music and art lessons. In the meantime, parents of generally the lower classes have subjected their children to adversity and possibly uncaring relationships as the parent struggle in their daily lives.\n\nFourth, the decline of free and unsupervised play has resulted in children less competent to face the world as they age. Children are not able to take small risks and learn from them. Children spend more time on mobile devices than in engaging in physical and social experiences. The socialization of children has suffered. Children no longer have the opportunity to solve small disputes without parents or other adults being involved. They now rely on “third parties” to take over when a situation arises where they may be disagreements.\n\nFifth, the bureaucracies of universities and colleges have greatly expanded the enforcement of the culture of safetyism. As an example, presented by Lukianoff and Haidt, a student visits a counselor for anxiety. During the visit, the counselor makes a leading statement, “Oh wow. People feel very anxious when they are in great danger.” The student now is being led to perceive danger. But this is not the end of it. The counselor then doing their required diligence under the campus rules reports to the Dean of Students that there was a cause for a visit. The Dean then sends a note to the student “I received a report that others are worried about your well being. … you are to refrain from discussing these issues with other students and use the appropriate resources listed below. If you involve other students … you will face disciplinary action. …“ A fictional example? No, it happened on a campus (references to it are given in the book.)\n\nUniversities are big business today, generating over a half trillion dollars annually. To support this revenue, they have created bureaucracies to perform research, education, fundraising, (who here hasn’t received a fundraising letter from their alma mater?) branding, marketing, and legal compliance. Students are considered to be “customers” with all of which that connotes. They are sold a product. “The customer is always right,” so that students are invited by the university to author their educational experiences according to their desires rather than towards the need of the education purportedly being received. As a result, the university overreacts as in the example above. In demands to reduce dissension on campus, (under the thread of movement towards the left,) universities have tried to restrict free speech on their campuses.\n\nSixth and lastly, the concept of social justice has been distorted. There is no widely accepted definition of “social justice,” but it would involve people getting what they deserve (distributive justice) and that the rules are applied fairly (procedural justice.) Social justice when it is consistent with these precepts is beneficial. Such social justice would remove artificial barriers and treat all people fairly. Today, under the various laws created with good intents, such as Title IX requiring universities and colleges to divide universities resources between female and male participants fairly, there are unintended consequences. Social justice is now being applied to the outcomes of groups rather than looking at justice for individuals. It is now considered acceptable to harm people for the desired outcomes. Thus, the distributive and procedural precepts of justice are being violated while reducing the fairness to individuals.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt propose a large number of fixes to these problems under the title, “Wising Up.” Most of these are direct and logical consequences of the six threads discussed. The universities and colleges have a lot to do to clean up their cultures. Lukianoff and Haidt are optimistic that they can do the work needed. Probably the best recommendations are, 1) reduce child access to social media in both time and type, 2) Allow children the freedom to play and develop their socialization skills, and 3) get rid of identity politics in the nation as this is fueling extremism towards both the left and right.",
    "What is happening on the college campus? Is it really as bad as the news stories report? What can be done about it? Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff have put together a book to help. The title is long enough to make a puritan blush, but it certainly sums up the message of the book: good intentions and bad ideas can do a lot of damage. The book was born out of a 2015 article written for the Atlantic by the same title (You can read it here). This is the second book by Jonathan Haidt I have reviewed. The Righteous Mind here. This book is not a screed against the “kids today” and how we just need to get back to the good old days. Haidt is a moral psychologist who works as a professor at NYU. Lukianoff is the president of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) which focuses on defending First Amendment rights in higher education. Both men independently noticed some disturbing trends which led them to co-author their initial article. Afterward, they decided to put their research into a book to delve deeper into the problem and offer solutions. The book is divided into four parts:\n\nPart 1: Three Bad Ideas\n\nThe authors explore three key bad ideas which seem to be accepted more and more in society:\n\n1) Kids are incredibly fragile.\n2) We should always trust our feelings.\n3) Life is a battle between good and evil people.\n\nThese ideas are bad because they are false. First, children are anti-fragile. They are not like glass which shatters. Rather they are more like a muscle that gets stronger when tested. This is not to say trauma is acceptable any more than we would say an athlete getting injured is getting stronger. The point is that kids are stronger than we think.\n\nSecond, the problem with always trusting our emotions is that we can be easily fooled. We lose the ability to have a healthy confrontation because we stop caring about someone’s intent and only care about their impact on our emotional state.\n\nThird, when we boil relationships down to only a conflict between good and evil people we will not be open to compromise or even listening to the other side. If I think my opponent is basically Hitler then I am not going to reason or persuade him. I am going to fight him.\n\nThese three key ideas are being taught and reinforced in our education system, entertainment, and social media. The problem with these ideas is not the intent behind them which is protection and the betterment of society. The problem is that these ideas in action make everything worse and actually do the opposite of what they intend: we become more fragile, more angry, more stressed and anxious and so on.\n\nPart 2: Bad Ideas in Action\n\nThis section catalogs cases where these bad ideas were put into play. The authors are careful to note that events are not indicative of every college campus. However, they are present in major universities predominantly on the west and east coasts. The authors review some of the riots that occurred in recent years on college campuses as well as the march in Charlottesville. They examine the nature of intimidation and violence that is trending in the news. Then they look at why our society is so prone to witch hunts and the importance of viewpoint diversity.\n\nPart 3: How Did We Get Here?\n\nThis section was the most emotionally difficult part of the book for me. The authors dissect how we arrived in this situation focusing upon polarization, anxiety and depression, the decline of play, the rise of safety policies, and the quest for justice. They examine the influences of social media, screens, overprotection, and misguided efforts to achieve social justice. This section is not blasting those who want justice, school administrators, parents or children. The authors are interpreting the data in terms of “six threads” that together help explain how it is we arrived in our present state.\n\nPart 4: Wising Up\n\nAgain, the book is not just old men yelling to protect their lawns. The authors present solutions along three lines: families, universities and society. They encourage parents to allow their kids to take calculated risks while resisting the urge to jump in as soon as they struggle. The authors talk about teaching children how to cope with disappointment and pain. They strongly recommend limiting screen time. There are more solutions, but if you want to know them you should read the book!\n\nREFLECTIONS\n\nThis book came out at the right time for me as I had just finished reading Haidt’s The Righteous Mind. I also watched the news and was actively wrestling with my own use of social media. Normally it takes me less than five minutes to fall asleep at night (apparently I’m overtired). Yet there was one-night last spring (2018) that I couldn’t go to sleep because I was so angry about things someone I didn’t know said on social media. My mind wouldn’t rest as I rolled over what my response would be to this person and how I would show them how wrong they were. I think it was around 1:00 am that I finalized my brilliant rhetorical salvo I would unleash in the morning. However, when I woke up I knew something was wrong with me. I needed to back off social media. Last fall I even deactivated my Facebook account. I didn’t even self-righteously announce it beforehand! The point is that I was primed to read this book.\n\nThis book thoughtfully and fairly engages with serious issues in our society which will get worse unless we commit to making serious changes. I appreciate the authors’ desire not to castigate or vilify anyone. They want to make things better. They assume that the people involved in these issues on the campus are acting in good faith. This allows for thoughtful analysis and generous criticism that actually contributes to the conversation. My only criticism is that the final three chapters which present solutions are very short. Perhaps in time, the authors can present how they and some of the groups they point to as good examples are handling these modern challenges. Also, this book cannot give us the reason why we ought to live this way except for the general improvement of society. For Christians, grace and holiness are central for how we interact with others (or at least they should be!). There are core reasons why we are compelled as followers of Christ to live differently than society. As a holy people (set apart by mercy) we do not participate in that which is abhorrent to God. But as people who have been saved by grace, we explain our hope and commitment to Jesus with gentleness, respect, and love. This is not really a criticism. It is an acknowledgment of the limits of a non-Christian book.\n\nI was challenged by this book to consider how I am raising my children particularly in terms of allowing them to take risks and giving them the room to fail. This book also led me to reflect on how I interact with others. I found myself reading this book saying, “Yeah, the Bible says we should do that…” We know it yet we don’t do it. For example: thinking the best of others or at least giving them the benefit of the doubt. Or how about not be hasty with our words in person and especially online? I seem to remember something about taking every thought captive. A good sign to me that this is a good book is that you leave it hopeful that we can do better or at least how I can do better.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nI said in my review of The Righteous Mind that I would likely recommend this book over that one. That turned out to be true. This book does a wonderful job explaining current trends and what can be done about them. Positively there seem to be reasons for hope that things are changing already on the college campus. While this is encouraging, the pressure to unnecessarily self-censor seems to be increasing and there remains a cause for concern. This book is well written, engaging and challenging. It is not a Christian book (I'ma pastor) so don’t expect biblical answers or a biblical worldview. I do recommend this book if you are looking for an insightful cultural analysis of the rise of terms like “trigger warning” and “safe space” and the current state of social discourse in America. Overall, an excellent read and well worth your time.",
    "Over 40 years ago, in Malcolm Bradbury’s The History Man, there is a proposal at a Senate meeting to invite a prominent geneticist as a guest speaker. One of the radical majority objects, on the grounds that “his work is fascist, and we've no business to confirm it by inviting him here. The conservative Dean mildly objects, “'I had always thought the distinguishing mark of fascism was its refusal to tolerate free enquiry”. The lecture goes ahead, but is broken up with violence.\n\nThis is the territory of this book, with an added dimension: modern students may be opposed to such speakers, but must be defended from them lest they be upset. Welcome to a subset of the snowflake generation.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt begin by amplifying the “three bad ideas” which, they claim, lie at the heart of the modern tendency of “campus safety”. They then give several real world examples of how this thinking manifests itself, suggest reasons for how we got here, and finally propose some ways to break the cycle.\n\nAccording to the authors, many students now expect “not to be exposed to intolerant and offensive ideals”. It is argued that that the suppression on campus of opinion deemed to be non-egalitarian is not new, and can be traced back to Herbert Marcuse (hence, I believe, the fictitious but realistic episode in the History Man), but has developed due to a variety of factors. These include:\n-Reaction to perception of intersectionality. (I first met this term last week, when watching Bath University’s video “Why is my curriculum white?” – required viewing, I suggest.) This can increase the extent of polarisation between different groups (if you’re not a good guy, you’re a bad guy).\n-The tendency for social media to increase the frequency and intensity of “call-out culture” (naming and shaming for small offences against political correctness)\n-The belief that physical violence is a justifiable means of preventing the expression of “hateful” views, e.g. racism.\n\nAs to how these factors came into play, some of the suggested causes are:\n-Universities have become more like large corporations, and like them have acquired an ever-growing army of administrators, for whom one main aim is to ensure students are “comfortable” – even if this means severely limiting students’ exposure to new ideas.\n[An example of this relates to the very article which was the origin of this book. A professor got his class to read the article, then asked them to discuss a controversial topic of their own choice (transgender issues). After the professor had said that the discussion needed to include the viewpoints of those opposed to some provision for transgender people, a student filed a “bias incident report” against him, after which the university did not rehire him.]\n-The students now coming to university – “iGen” arrive having had “less unsupervised time and fewer offline life experience than any previous generation”, which ill prepares them for confronting ideas alien to them. The authors suggest that this is not simply an Internet issue, as the preceding generation - the Millennials – were made of stronger stuff. As an example, the book contrasts a questionnaire given to parents of new first-graders in 1979, which majored on how independent the child was, and a modern equivalent concerned mainly with their academic level.\n\nThe remedies the authors suggest are targeted at children, and include CBT, mindfulness and limitation of screen time. If the “campus safety culture” is as embedded as claimed here, and elsewhere in the media, it may take more than these techniques to shift it, but it’s a start.\n\nBravely, Lukianoff describes how, several years ago, CBT helped him to overcome his own suicidal feelings. He uses this as an example of how to recognise cognitive distortion, the factor which influences so many modern students to exaggerate the impact of speech and ideas which do not suit them.\n\nYou may or may not agree with the book, but it is valuable reading for anyone who wants to get a feel for current campus atmosphere, or is concerned about how it has developed. The raguments are generally well-presented, though the authors could havetaken slighltly more of their own medicine, i.e. included more content based on interviews with the “safety” school of thought.\n\nI started with Malcolm Bradbury, so I’ll finish with the statement, erroneously credited to Voltaire, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”. This, as much as anything, is the core argument of the book.",
    "Being a fan of Jon Haidt I very much enjoyed this book. Both authors explain the trends we've been seeing in both universities and society clearly and concisely. Being a psychotherapist who works at a university and having first hand experience with these issues, this book is a great help in my understanding. I've been observing for a while that the thinking patterns of (some) of the very far left (and also young people) are replicating all the very unhealthy cognitive distortions, which we often try and undo in the therapeutic setting in order to help people have happier and functional lives. It filled me with both relief and sadness to have my thoughts on this confirmed. Clearly the authors have explained all this in a way I never could, so for me it's an excellent book and I would recommend this everyone whether you work with young people or not.",
    "This book is about the change in the way children born after 1995 were brought up. It is not just the authors who have noted a significant change. Others such as Ben Sasse and Jean Twenge have noted the change. The authors here pointed out that it was Twenge who identified 1995 as the cut-off year. The parenting attitude post 1995, amplified by increased use of electronic devices, caused parents and administrators to practice ‘safetyism’. That is what the authors refer to as ‘coddling’. Children are over-protected. Instead of leaving them to develop an immune response to peanuts, protecting children from contact with peanuts had the reverse effect, it caused an increase in peanut allergy in children. These children belong to the generation that is known as ‘iGen’.\n\nOver-reaction to speeches that offend, students demand that universities curb such speeches. The authors point out that those speeches may offend, but they are not violent and cause no physical harm. The conventional response, especially in a place of tertiary education, is to present opposing speeches so that the audience and students can evaluate the opposing views. That is no longer the case. Protests by students have led to universities cancel planned lectures or remove speakers whose views the students do not like.\n\nTwo important changes have been noted. First, iGen grow up more slowly because they spend less time in social interaction. Secondly, the rate of anxiety and depression has risen rapidly. What has driven the surge in mental illness among the young? The authors point to the spread of smart phones and social media. Combined with a lack of training to deal with adverse comments, young people become more sensitive to criticism – and in social media, social criticism can be extremely harsh. The young need to be toughened, not coddled.\n\nConsequently, those children grow up into adulthood incapable of dealing with criticism. Everything becomes a harassment to them. This leads to the curtailing of enriching alternative views, and in turn, affect one’s understanding of justice. In this regard, the chapter ‘The Quest for Justice’ is enlightening. Justice, the authors point out, is multi-faceted.\n\nHow do we redress the problem of safetyism? The authors recommend ‘cognitive behavioural therapy’, a simple guide is set out in the appendix to the book. The last part of the book also provides many ways to help overcome the impact of safetyism.\n\nThe CD version is very clear and very well read, with a brief epilogue by Jonathan Haidt.",
    "When I went to University in Britain in my thirties, I looked forward to sitting at the feet of the intellectually gifted and thoughtful, engaging in discussion where varying viewpoints were defended or discarded and reading widely. in this book that makes for profoundly distressing reading, an arrogant, monstrous, unchallenged and self-righteous cadre of teenagers have been allowed to run riot on American campuses, causing mayhem at events, getting staff sacked and raising issues where none exist, all in the name of political correctness, an obsession with the 'rights' of minorities to the exclusion of all others and a scale of intolerance that puts Mao's Red Guard in the shade. Shamefully, academe in America has capitulated to this nonsense allowing ill-formed, barely educated young people to disrupt learning, stifle debate and indulge in verbal and physical violence that might have been learnt in the re-education camps of pre-modern China. Haidt, unfortunately, is an honest if benign observer / commentator looking at solutions and offering explanations which while plausible and perceptive do nothing to stop this madness in its tracks. He is unreasonably optimistic in his conclusions. Revisiting parenting of Generation Snowflake etc might be a long term solution and even schooling for intellectual humility might help but at present a troubled and destructive group of teenagers are on the rampage and instead of 'confronting and sending down' the troublemakers, long time gifted academics are resigning, their careers ruined. A good book, who knows, perhaps Haidt is simply cataloguing the existential hell that is modern American life.",
    "Are good intentions and bad ideas setting up a generation for failure? This is the proposition in the subtitle of a provocative critique of western society built from analysis of the breakdown of diversity and polarisation within the United States which is creeping our way. The authors note trends alongside this polarization: increased adolescent depression, overprotective regimes in universities, pursuit of justice that makes the best an enemy of the good, obsessive use of phones and tablets, widespread play deprivation and more fearful parenting.\n\n‘Paranoid parenting… convinces children that the world is full of danger; evil lurks in the shadows, on the streets, and in public parks and restrooms. Kids raised in this way are emotionally prepared to embrace the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people - a worldview that makes them fear and suspect strangers. We teach children to monitor themselves for the degree to which they “feel unsafe” and then talk about how unsafe they feel. They may come to believe that feeling “unsafe” (the feeling of being uncomfortable or anxious) is a reliable sign that they are unsafe (the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings). Finally, feeling these emotions is unpleasant; therefore, children may conclude, the feelings are dangerous in and of themselves - stress will harm them if it doesn’t kill them (the Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker)’.\n\nIn ‘The Coddling of the American Mind’ free speech campaigner Greg Lukianoff allies social psychologist Jonathan Haidt to challenge these three ‘untruths of fragility, emotional reasoning and ‘us versus them’’ as contradictory to both ancient wisdom and modern psychology besides being harmful to individuals and communities who subscribe to them. A presenting problem is the use of social media by the passionate to rubbish people and not just ideas with loss of the time tested wisdom of giving people the benefit of the doubt. A deception that the world is made up of ‘Us versus Them’ is promoted by the same media as people live in ‘self-confirmatory bubbles, where their worst fears about the evils of the other side can be confirmed and amplified by extremists and cyber trolls intent on sowing discord and division’. Coupled to this deception is promotion of a safety culture in which people’s need to feel comfortable is put on the same level as their need to be protected from physical danger. The consequences for the rising generation is a certain naivety as they grow up protected from life experience they need to develop resilient living.\n\nThe authors cite critically a quotation from an essay in EverydayFeminism.com: ‘In the end, what does the intent of our action really matter if our actions have the impact of furthering the marginalization or oppression of those around us? Such an understanding makes bigots of all of us who upset others with our views however pure our intentions’. Paradoxically distinguishing hurtful talk from harmful talk, a distinction widely accepted in ancient wisdom traditions, serves to help address the roots of conflict. This is why universities have been up to now loth to protect their students from ideas some of them find offensive bearing in mind the purpose of education as bringing people out of their comfort zones to make them think.\n\nRabbi Jonathan Sacks is commended for rebuking a ‘pathological dualism that sees humanity itself as radically ... divided into the unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad. You are either one or the other.’ Western society is being crippled by disrespect shown in debates lacking humility in which people rubbish one another, blind to the truth that, whatever opinions they hold, all human beings possess both fragility and beauty. The authors mention unfavourably the oratory of Donald Trump and some of the things being said in the Brexit debate.\n\nWhat strategies can bring the world out of such error? The authors look particularly to religion as a source of transformative vision quoting Martin Luther-King: ‘Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend… Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.’ It's ironic that the vision that impelled King is getting increasingly obscured by those offended by religion’s immemorial place in the public square. This is a challenging, inspiring and timely book."

    "Series Info/Source: This is the complete Maus graphic novel. I got a copy of this as a Christmas Gift.\n\nThoughts: The dense writing style and heavy lined black and white artwork were a bit intimidating at first but once I got started reading the story I didn’t even notice it or find it hard to read. This story is completely engrossing. Spiegelman does an amazing job of alternating between the past and the present and recounting the intense and sad story of his father living through the Holocaust. What amazed me is he did in a way that was incredibly impactful without ever being too dark.\n\nI was completely engrossed in this book from page one. And I quickly grew to love Maus’s father and his family. I was continually surprised how much of Maus’s father’s survival was because of how resourceful his father was. His father is extremely adaptable and takes on every chance he has to learn a new skill, this (along with quite a bit of luck) is the number one thing that leads to him surviving the nightmare of the Holocaust.\n\nIs this an uplifting book? Not really, it is more of a cautionary tale. Even though his father survives the Holocaust, the effects continue to echo through his life many years later. The people who survived the events of the Holocaust have to live with the Holocaust forever in their minds and this continues to affect their families generations later. So much thought and skill went into telling this story; it was just incredibly well done.\n\nThere is some irony to the fact that I asked for this for Christmas and then shortly after it was banned in Texas because of inappropriate content. I don’t know how to tell people this…but the whole Holocaust was inappropriate and it would be really hard to tell an accurate story of what happened without going into some of the violence and death that happened.\n\nIs the violence and death presented in an excessive way in this book? Most definitely not. Discussions of the gas chambers and killing of children in the streets of ghettos are addressed matter of factly. Hiding in piles of dead people’s shoes and witnessing the aftermath of a gas chamber are things that really happened. At the time these people were trying to survive one atrocity after another; the atrocities were fact and they are presented as such in this book. People did what they could to keep themselves and their families safe.\n\nShould you have your five year old read this? Well do you want to explain the Holocaust to your 5 year old? I might hold off for a bit. We talked about the Holocaust with my son in late elementary/early middle school. He actually checked out this very book from his middle school library and had A LOT of questions for us after he read it. They were excellent questions and we had some very good and thoughtful discussions as a family because of this book. This is a incredibly valuable way to learn about the Holocaust. I think it should be available for everyone in middle school and older to read.\n\nMy Summary (5/5): Overall I was incredibly impressed with this graphic novel and the amazing job it did blending the past of the Holocaust with the effect it continues to have on people’s day to day lives. I would recommend to middle grade and up readers because the Holocaust is a complicated topic and kids need to be a certain age in order to begin to comprehend cruelty on this scale. Is this book excessively violent or “Inappropriate”? No, not at all. It addresses the topic with excellent candor wrapped into an incredibly engaging story of one man’s survival of these horrific events.",
    "Horrifying but so important to read.\nI think my favorite aspect of the book was how Spiegelman didn’t try to “spruce up” his father’s personality or his father and stepmother’s relationship.\nHis father is presented as is and what he is is a man with prejudices and major flaws of his own. Vladek, while very caring, is also very stingy with money, constantly argues with Mala (his second wife after Spiegelman’s mother died by suicide) and urges Francois to drive away when he sees a black person and argues with Spiegelman and Francois when they are outraged about his racism. And not once did Spiegelman say “wow my dad is awful he definitely didn’t deserve to live through the camps” because the point that is driven home is that EVERYONE and ANYONE, regardless of how “good” or “bad” you were, was being exterminated and nobody deserves what happened to those millions.\nIt’s also clear that despite their turbulent relationship, Spiegelman and his father loved each other very much.\nIt’s such a heartbreaking story and I love that Spiegelman chose to tell it honestly and objectively instead of trying to make his father more palatable in order to turn his story into bland inspiration p*rn (like a certain book with “pajamas” in the title) in hopes of it selling better.\nI highly recommend it, you won’t be able to put it down once you pick it up!",
    "I bought this specifically as it had been banned recently as I tend to want to read what others do not want me to as a contrarian. It is a graphic novel so the tale is told in pictures as well as words which takes some work to read, and the subject matter is dark and the author does a good job of presenting it very clearly without hiding truth as he sees it. It is a story about a man trying to understand his grandfather and a time he went through that changed him before the author ever met him.\n\nIt does have some very brutal bits, it covers the holocaust from the perspective of someone who was a victim of it in Poland as the Nazi regime was in power, and someone who was sent to a concentration camp and was a survivor but knew many who were not personally. The author relates these stories as told to him and draws them as well, even as he also shows his own conflicts with his feeling about it in the modern day as a young man in America. The contrast of the old grandfather he has to deal with now whose habits and mannerisms he finds range from annoying to infuriating at times, to the person he is discovering from his stories, an optimistic and naïve youth who is being bent and shaped by harsh realities and a changing power structure, is really expressed often and passionately.\n\nThe novel is actually broken up into two books, and the writer states he thought about stopping writing due to how much it was affecting him to keep digging into this material. This was not an easy book to write, nor an easy story for him to hear. Especially it was not an easy thing for him to go through with is grandfather and be able to reconcile the man he knew with the man he discovered, and finally the more complete man he was left with. All of this comes through very clearly as you read this book.\n\nIn the end I felt I got a glimpse into two men's lives, and a bit of perspective on a point in history that I was not a part of and how it shaped attitudes going forward. Trying to understand things from a different person's POV is important, it allows us to empathize and challenge our own views, either strengthening them or removing flaws to make them better. I saw nothing in here that needs to be banned, to be unwritten or not shared, nothing that can't be talked about.\n\nIt has ideas and words, opinions and personal points of view. Mostly it has one person telling us another persons story and how it made him feel. About the story, and about the other person. It is one man's truth, as honest as all of our own truths, and just as valid and deserving of being heard. Debate it, avoid it, read it or share it but do not ban it I implore you.",
    "Containing both volumes 1 and 2 of Maus: A Survivor’s Tale, The Complete Maus tells the complete story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experience of surviving in Hitler’s Europe.\n\nThe first and most important thing to make note of is that this is a completely true story. It isn’t a piece of fiction based in the truth of Auschwitz, it is a true account of Art Spiegelman’s father’s life during World War II. It is a heavy and intense read, but completely incredible.\n\nThe second important thing you need to know about this book is that it is a graphic novel. It is masterfully drawn, with plenty of narration which makes it easy to read even if you’re not a regular graphic novel reader. The metaphorical representation of people is a massive part of this book. Jews are drawn as mice, Nazis as cats, the Allies as dogs, and Poles as pigs. This is an incredibly effective commentary on stereotypes, and highlights the absurdity of dividing people by nationality.\n\nThe brutal honesty about life as a Jew during the Nazi occupation is shocking and horrific, but truly, truly fascinating. On another level, the relationship between Art and Vladek is also explored, and it really shows how the children of survivors can be so affected by the experience of their parents.\n\nMaus isn’t an easy or pleasant read by any means, but it is powerful and it’s essential. If you’re into graphic novels, you MUST read this book. If you’re into historical accounts and memoirs, you MUST read this book. If you read anything at all, you MUST read this book.",
    "This was the first graphic novel I ever read when I was young, from a library. Years later it was the first graphic novel I ever bought.\n\nI've got nothing to add that hasn't been said already but just do yourself a favour and read it.",
    "This was an excellent graphic novel that captures the fear, the barbaric cruelty and nihilism of the Holocaust more poignantly than many a text-only book could. The story is set half in present day USA where the main protagonist, Vladek Spiegelman, and his son, Art, are now living, and half in Poland and Germany from the mid 1930s to the end of WWII. Art wants to document the experiences of his parents before and during WWII, and painstakingly draws out his father’s memories.\nThere are no human faces in this book. The Jews are depicted as mice, the Nazis as cats, Poles as pigs, Americans as dogs etc.\nThere is a split perception of mice as animals. On one side they are portrayed in much of children’s literature are cute and non-threatening, and on the other as vermin to be exterminated. Above all, they are powerless in the presence of larger, more predatory animals (such as cats). Mice being slaughtered evokes sympathy in a way that the extermination of other ‘vermin’, such as rats, never could.\nWhen the story begins, Vladek is a successful businessman in Poland, courting Anja. Slowly the rumours of anti-Jewish attacks by Nazis in Germany and Czechoslovakia reach them. At first it is seen as a problem elsewhere, but bit by bit, the danger that the Polish Jewish community is in becomes apparent – but it is too late. The story deals with the attempts at hiding and sending of children to supposedly safer places, and then the rounding up of the Jews and the deportations to Auschwitz. Vladek’s life in Auschwitz and then later in Dachau is told, along with the luck and ingenuity that enabled Vladek to stay alive, when so many around him perished.\nVladek is not a sympathetic character. While he may have physically survived the Holocaust, his personality has been forever damaged by his experiences. He is unable to have a close relationship with his son or his second wife. Instincts that enabled him to survive, form a barrier between himself and everyone around him. In some ways, his mind seems to have never left Dachau. Because of this, the trauma of the Holocaust lasts well beyond the 1940s, and impacts directly on the offspring – and further generations – of the survivors. Art wants to understand the difficult man who is his father, and writing/drawing this book is his way of doing that.\nThis is not a book to enjoy reading. It is an important witness account, that needs to be documented and read. The black and white drawings (colour only on the cover) underline the seriousness of the content and the desperation of the world at that time, and have a visceral impact on the reader.\nI highly recommend this book – to everyone.",
    "Originally posted on A Frolic Through Fiction\n\nAs someone who loves learning about history, I was always going to like this graphic memoir. And while I’m on a bid to introduce myself to more non fiction, a graphic memoir was the perfect way to start that.\n\nSo this is the story of Vladek Spiegelman, drawn through his son, Art Spiegelman. And that one point alone – how it was done – was the main crux of my enjoyment. Because it wasn’t just the story of war. Oh no. Instead of simply drawing what his father said, Art Spiegelman actually drew the entire process. He drew himself visiting his dad, coaxing him into telling more of his story. He drew what he was like in later life, a small snapshot into how all this affected him long-term. And through that, I found myself feeling like I was sat right in front of Vladek Spiegelman – him in a chair, myself cross legged on the floor – while he told his story. How a graphic memoir can do that, with so little words in comparison to novels, is beyond me. But I loved it.\n\nAnd then we have the art. Completely black and white with quite a sketchy look, each page is packed with drawings. It can look a bit overwhelming at first, but I personally think it suits the story really well. There’s the metaphor too – the Nazis are drawn as cats, terrorising the mice (ding ding ding, we have the title: Maus). Such a simple way to explain things, in a time when things weren’t simple at all. Suitable for a graphic memoir though, since there’s not really much leverage in explaining who each person on the page is and which “side” they belong to.\n\nI expected to get emotional. But… I didn’t. I have a feeling that’s partly to do with the fact it’s a graphic memoir, and not as much time is spent describing how horrendous everything is. But also because of Vladek Spiegelman himself. It’s his story, yet as he tells it, he doesn’t seem to reveal many emotions. He just…tells the story. Here are the facts. This is what happened.\n\nThough I might have felt more had a bit more been revealed about Art Spiegelman’s mother. In the beginning, it’s mentioned that she committed suicide after the war, and while it does go into it a little bit, nothing about that is really explained. Granted, that may be because they don’t know much themselves. But still. She’s mentioned so often throughout the memoir – as you would expect – but she herself doesn’t seem to be in it much. I’d have liked to see more of her.\n\nAs hard as they try, books will never be able to portray these events accurately. Nothing will. There’s a nod to that even in this book. But with things like these, though I (luckily) may not be able to imagine such ongoing hunger, such heartbreak, the pain and suffering…I might be able to understand a bit more. I can read books like this and know that at least their story isn’t going untold. At least I’ll be here, remembering for them. And that is the least I can do.",
    "This is a masterpiece.\n\nThey say that a picture paints a thousand words, but master cartoonist and artist Art Spiegelman has drawn a lifetime. Tracing his father's experiences of the Holocaust, Spiegelman delivers something intensely powerful and emotional.\n\nIt may seem insensitive to portray the horrors of the Holocaust in a cartoon form, but there's actually something deeply immersive about this format. Like all good art should, the medium of this story pulls you into the experience; opening up the pores of our soul to receive the full potency of this stories message. With each frame of this cartoon you sense the foreboding danger, the growing dehumanisation, and the shock of what transpired.\n\nThe gas chambers and incinerators of Auschwitz, the forced labour, the street hangings, the disenfranchisement of homes and businesses and basic human dignity; the demonisation, scapegoating, and media-induced prejudice; the public beatings; the survivalist-led betrayal from neighbour and friends and countrymen; the slow and corrosive stripping away of personal identity which culminated in being reduced to a number...maybe if we could go back and witness these things we would turn ourselves away and refuse to reflect on the horror. But we need to see, and we need to learn, and *Maus*, alongside the stories of other survivors, helps us to do this.\n\nThe Holocaust is something we should never forget. Especially in today's world, where we find ourselves once more giving our ears and voices to the growing tide of stigmatisation, fear-mongering, nationalism and the dehumanisation of certain people groups. We may feel our words and opinions have no effect, that they're 'innocent' or 'harmless', but history shows how dangerously ignorant such thinking can be and how catastrophic the consequences are.\n\n--Tristan Sherwin, author of *Love: Expressed*."

    "I couldn't put this book down so I read it through the night. I wanted to highlight everything that I read. The writing is fluid and breathtaking\nlike nothing I can compare it with, the feelings beyond words.\n\nThis is a love letter to his mother that she will never be able to read.\nFrom a dream to a nightmare, A stark reality of brutality to the space of beauty and hope. A moment of transitory beauty or brutality leaving space from darkness to light.\n\nOcean Vuong is a masterful storyteller. His words are raw and powerful,\nwith loss and struggle, survival and freedom, the power to be heard by those he loved with astonishment over irony.\n\nHe writes of the migration of butterflies, love in a tobacco barn, purple flowers gathered by the road.\n\nHe speaks of war, poverty and the immigrants life, beautiful and ugly\nAmerican History, body image, trust and betrayal, humanity.\n\nBuy this beautiful book for a great read.\n\nHis book of poetry, Night Sky With Exit Wounds is beautifully written as well.",
    "The pain of the Vietnam War left splinters all across the globe—at the scale of both\nwar-torn countries and broken households. In the novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, poet Ocean Vuong details the years of physical abuse endured from a mother suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after fleeing her homeland and the intense guerilla warfare associated with it. The United State’s involvement in the Vietnam War comes a result of a vain attempt to ‘contain’ communism within Southeast Asia. Vietnam was torn into two separate entities; one of which supported the Soviet cause and the other backed by the military giant that is the United States. Vuong beautifully illustrates the racialized and politicized distributions of ‘controlled’ space and power over nature, while also including the achingly painful caveat of war time abuse and the devastating effects of the struggle for materialistic control of land.\nOne of the most powerful aspects of this piece of work is its showcase of the intersectionality between race, gender, and power. In Part 1, Vuong details the story of his grandmother, a young Vietnamese woman who flees an arranged marriage and is sexually assaulted by an American soldier, producing a ‘white-passing’ child. The woman, self-named to be Lan, is approached by two American soldiers on the street, both of which are noticeably intoxicated and carrying massive M-16s. Lan urinates on herself, standing “on the life-sized period of her own sentence, alive” thanks to the paleness of her daughter. This memory from Vuong’s grandmother is striking as it points back to an argument made by researcher Donna Haraway regarding feminist political ecology. The earth, with an “independent sense of humor, is its own active subject in the propagation of gender and social norms. Lan’s ability as a woman to reproduce protected her from imminent death, pointing to an argument made by feminist poltical ecologist Sharlene Mollett which describes that as humans, we are historically entered into heavily racialized and sexualized relationships, so there is no way to properly separate these traits as completely isolated from the other. The binary hierarchy that existed within this confrontation was ultimately created by the differing characteristics that nature and culture have created to categorize men and women into separate social classes, with regard to race as well.\nVuong also successfully illustrates the lack of fairly paid domestic labor done by women of color. His mother, Rose, works in a nail salon where the violent, noxious fumes worked to develop asthma in the young lungs of the employee’s children. The ability of this environment, glamorized by the lure of the ‘American dream,’ to cause extreme bodily harm is not reflected within the American economy. The deeply ingrained, patriarchal ideal of success does not include labor that is seen as undesirable. Silvia Federici, an influential socialist feminist thinker, argues that this ignorance points to an even larger flaw in the way our workforce is structured, and how capitalism takes advantage of our nation’s most vulnerable. Vuong shares an\ninteresting perspective on this by stating that he hates and loves his mother’s battered hands for what they can never be. Even the child of an immigrant, conditioned by abuse to respect and\nfear his mother, is ashamed of her occupation. Compared to similar accounts of families chasing the ‘American dream,’ the rawness of Vuong’s emotions makes his entire sentiment even more powerful, as he appeals to each side.\n\nLater in the story, Vuong grapples with his sexuality and an opioid addiction, conditioned to believe both are evil. This novel is special in many ways, but its strong, emotional tone helps the reader to connect even deeper to the barriers an immigrant family faces, even if they have no experience with the subject. Early on in the story, we learn that Rose, Vuong’s mother, is illiterate. This open letter of resentment, pride, and love that he feels towards his mother will never be received by her, as she cannot conceptualize the act of reading and writing. The notion that Vuong is writing this as a way to reinforce his ownership over the experiences he has endured continues to impress his audience as a second generation, queer man of color taking his own power in a society that systemically does not grant him any.",
    "Ocean Vuong could not have done better. The way this book had me crying from sadness while simultaneously healing me is insane. Little dog says and thinks very differently from the world because of everything he and his family have been through, yet it is so incredibly relatable. It's like he takes what everyone notices and wants to say but puts it into words that make sense.\n\nThe plots. YES.\nThe storyline. YES.\nCharacter description. YES.\nLiterary masterpiece. YES. YES. YES.",
    "Reading the reviews of this book here, I found a fascinating snapshot of who we are: richly feeling and yet constrained, open and still closed in mind and heart, welcoming and resolutely petty, loving but spiteful. The book itself was, for me, incandescent, soaring to great heights, and crushing, dragging me as reader to terrible depths. In the balance, the book is a paean to beauty in all its forms--and beauty takes shapes that pierce the spirit with both pain and joy. Regarding literary sensibility, for me there are strains of Proust in the seemingly involuntary function of memory. Another reviewer related this to Whitman and I can absolutely understand why. The references to Barthes, Duchamp, etcetera are part of my regular lexicon of references (given my own work) so Vuong's literary allusions felt natural to me, though I could imagine others growing discontent with the exposure to the unfamiliar--when they don't wish to be sidetracked by new ideas. For me that was always a joy in reading a well-read writer (e.g., Eco or Borges). Vuong loves language with a passion; that is obvious. His ardor sings. The tune is a sometimes a dithyramb, often an elegy, occasionally a hymn, and at times a heartbreaking lament. If I were to offer a criticism of faults, there were a few moments of uneveness of quality in parts II and III. But these seemed exceedingly minor to me in the context of the total work.\n\nThe book is not for everyone. I write that in manner similar to saying that Joyce isn't for everyone. Readers who claim the book is bad because they couldn't understand it, because Vuong doesn't follow a straight line or leave a clear thread in the labyrinth for them to follow are claiming a rather pedestrian criterion for a universal judgment. By that measure, \"Finnegans Wake\" is a crime against humanity! Here's a thought: \"I don't like this sort of writing\" is a very different statement from \"this is bad writing.\" The former is wholly understandable and might just be a matter of individual taste. The latter is a declaration of critical finality, the rightful domain of consensus and posterity. And to those who recoiled in homophobic disgust, I beg you to try opening yourself up to the world as others live it. I'm a straight white male, so I share neither the same sexual desires nor experiences of America (or world) as the author, but allowing myself to empathize with the characters Vuong writes only makes the scope of human understanding that much broader for me. To feel like some agenda is being pushed upon one here is less a reflection on author, publisher, or reviewers than upon one's own defense mechanisms and inability to momentarily leave a world that only affirms only a dominant narrative that reflects one's own experiences. The abuse of the narrator and other figures, the violence against animals: these things are horrific and abject, yes. But they are also a part of life. As part of life they are subjects of poetic reflection; life is not all happy songs and roses, why should art be? I remember someone complaining that Goya's \"Disasters\" were so horrific as to render his art bad, or not art at all. Most of us would find that idea risible, but I see the sentiment repeated here. Turning our backs on brutality is to give it access to us unchecked and unexamined. The violence in \"On Earth,\" never felt gratuitous to me nor aestheticized for the sake of glorifying violence or excusing it. Rather, it seemed to me that Vuong explored the ambivalences of our brutality, our ability to be loving, caring monsters, beautiful and horribly flawed. Anyhow, I loved the book and recommend it if you are looking for a read that with at once enthrall and challenge you. I read it in one sitting, so I can say that Vuong captured something profound and compelling for me, personally. I honestly find it hard to believe how young he is; there is a wealth of experience and reflection here that is seemingly beyond his years. I look forward to his future endeavors.",
    "This is one of those books that reminds me why I read.\n\nSure, I read for pleasure and to keep at bay anxieties and worries that otherwise occupy my mind (that’s what my romance/chick-lit stacks are for) but my true love for the written word came from discovering the beauty of depth and emotion that’s hidden within the lyrical prose of select writers.\n\nTo say that the writing in this book is gorgeous would be an understatement. There is one measure I use to determine if I find a particular writer/book worth of high praise and that’s if it makes me jealous. And boy am I jealous of Vuong’s ability to write so rawly that it almost bruises you.\n\nOf the top of my head, I have a few favorites when it comes to formidable, evocative but also heartbreaking writing, Yiyun Li, Haruki Murakami, Madeline Miller to name a few. Today I’ve just added Ocean Vuong to the list.\n\nI’ve forgotten how much I love to stare at a phrase and reread it in my head until it involuntarily imprints itself in my memory . I tend to read a lot of “feel good, easy to digest” books with simple writing, for the obvious fact that I won’t dwell on them, I won’t torture myself with existential questions and most importantly I can file them away as soon as I’m done. There will be no extra burden on my mind, I won’t obsess for days questioning life, meaning, history, etc.\n\nBut sometimes I want to invite that kind of reaction, I want to feel, I wanna be awed and lured in by gorgeous words that cut deep and then I wanna be healed of their bruising force, by extending my own understanding and contemplation to their meaning and purpose.\nI did all that with this book. And I loved every second of it.\n\nI realise this sounds more like a diary entry than a review but I feel like I don’t need to talk about plot, characters, or any of the usual suspects because this book inspires so much more than a clinical analysis. So pick it up and enjoy it, don’t give it that much thought.",
    "\"Did you know people get rich off of sadness? I want to meet the millionaire of American sadness. I want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, 'it's been an honor to serve my country.\"\n\nThis is not a novel, or at least not in a sense a novel is often described as but more like an amalgamation of ideas, poetry, essays, memoir with a touch of fiction, just enough to camouflage it as a novel for the sake of the wider world. In an interview, Ocean Vuong says he was inspired to write something similar (thematically and structurally) to Moby Dick, how Herman Melville never \"compromised in a way it follows it's curiosity\". And here as well Vuong replicates it. On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous isn't about one thing solely; it's multi faceted. And what can I say about the beauty?\n\nIt's not a secret that he writes beautifully; even the word \"beautiful\" feels redundant in comparison but that's the highest praise in the English dictionary, isn't it? Read this - \"If you forget me, then you've gone too far. Turn back\", do I need to say anything else about the language, the writing style. As for the plot, there is none. It just flows, stories mingle into each other, more like smoke rising in the sky. It's about Vietnam, war, immigration, mothers, sons, heritage, queerness, sex, American, dream and whiteness.\n\nIt's not a perfect book; there are points where the book is relatively weak and inconsistent; points where I thought, wtf! Speaking politely, I even got bored especially towards the end where things got a little \"abstract\". Sometimes the beautiful words just seem like beautiful words and nothing more, weightless and fleeting. But when it's good, it's really good, when it shines, it shines like the lord himself.\n\nIf you are planning to read this book, I will say one thing, read it slowly. Even though it's a 240 page book and one could read it in a day or two, I would recommend stretching it over a week. Read a paragraph and let it sink. Take time with this book because it demands it. Read a passage you think is beautifully written again and again until you memorize it. This is how this book should be read. Like an expensive meal.",
    "What an exceptional writer Vuong is. I had read his poetry but really his talent comes to life (in my opinion!) in this magnificent piece of prose. At times disturbing, compelling, beautiful, tender, goosebump-inducing. He is just an amazing writer and there is so much to grab and keep my attention here; I have read it twice now. I look forward to watching his continued success and reading whatever he writes next.",
    "Sadly despite hearing great things I didn't enjoy this at all and almost dreaded picking it up but was determined to finish it. There is some beautiful prose and clearly the author is a great poet but as a novel I found it quite horrible to read, depressing, a lot of waffle and bizarre storytelling techniques. This is the only book I haven't kept in a while.",
    "My son recommend the book to me saying it had spoken volumes to him. Got it only day before yesterday . Read it like one drinking water. I understand why my son sent the message. Like Lan and Rose i have begun a new story. Living in a foreign land with a foreign name changed to less foreign surname but am still me. Forever me. My son is him forever"

    "Very down the middle description of the modern mindset in which we find ourselves. Or as the book would call it, the \"social imaginary\". Truman purposely avoids inflammatory language or accusations in order to give an accurate picture of the divide, though those who lean \"progressive\" will probably feel otherwise. But that is for the very reason that forms the crux of his book; their view of the world is interiorly focused and indivisible from their identity, so even the most rational analysis will feel like a personal attack. For the rest of us however, this is an eye-opening expose of what is going on \"beneath the surface\" of modern policy and social movements. A must read.",
    "This book is a great look at how we got here as a society. How the issues of gender confusion, sexual perversion, and other immoral acts are complex issues spanning decades of time. The book does not really offer solutions; however, I think the author’s intention is to inform the reader of the complexities of today’s most pressing and controversial issues. It is well-written and fundamentally sound!",
    "A concise encapsulation of The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self. A clear introduction to the ideas and forces that have led us to where we are today in a sexualized and politicized culture obsessed with identity and authenticity. Even if you don't agree with the author politically, theologically or even intellectually I think it is a powerful argument that should be wrestled with and engaged.\n\nThis has been developed as a resource for churches and Christian groups, there is a video and study guide, and that flavor comes out most strongly in the last chapter. But I think you can learn a lot by viewing the argument descriptively rather than as a moral critique.\n\nI think this is one of a handful of books that really sheds light on the worldview of our culture and how it operates, how we got here, and where we are headed.",

    "Great overview of where we are as a society.",
    "Trueman does a wonderful job at breaking down the understructure of the time and culture we currently find ourselves within. Diving into aspects of \"expressive individualism\" and the \"sexual revolution\" and showing the progression of the self, moving from submission to divine external morality, to the culturally celebrated performance of inward sexualized expression as the ultimate moral standard.\n\nI found this book to be a wonderful cultural exegesis while remaining approachable for those previously unfamiliar with the names and philosophies discussed throughout. The book is concise and to the point, and neither throws any punches nor withholds the truth of biblical stance and reasoning in response to what's happening in the world around us.\n\nEach chapter brings you on a natural progression from the chapters before and takes you into the developing thought processes and cultural imagination of the west over the past 500 years. Finishing with the final chapter which, I greatly respect, is a short overview of how the church should consider responding to the culture that already has reservations if not disdain toward our voice in the matters. Trueman is not quick to assert a know-it-all stance on how to respond, but instead gives healthy guidelines and ancient voices to submit to as the body of Christ discerns its best response.\n\nI have already recommended this book to many pastoral colleagues and individuals in leadership. I truly believe this is one of the most significant books of our day for gaining a clear grasp on the undercurrents of our culture and the culture that is affecting, and ultimately influencing, those we lead. Knowing how we got to where we currently are can truly help in knowing how we might get to where we need to be.",
    "Trueman distills the issues of our day to helps us ponder and reflect on our response. In particular, his discussion on gender identity and how it relates and affects freedom of speech and religion are helpful to see where America is headed. In the end, his challenge to each Christian is to stay focused on our Savior while we follow with unfailing hope.",
    "Excellent (and more accessible) follow-up to his previous book, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self. I found both books very helpful in diagnosing how our culture has come to this peculiar moment. I think every Christian \"leader\" should not only read this book, it should be highest on their reading list after their Bible.\nMy recommendation in reading Strange New World is this:\n\n1. Read the Foreword and Preface\n2. Next, read the 1-2 page \"Conclusion\" at the end of each chapter (Chapters 1-8)\n3. Next, read Chapter 9, the book's overall conclusion.\n4. Finally, go back and read the book cover-to-cover, highlighting important ideas/quotations/etc.\n\nMy intention is to glean heavily from this book to create a seminar/talk for collegians.\n\nThank you, Dr. Carl Trueman, for the many hours you put into these books -- an excellent service to a culture that's lost its sense of external, objective truth.",
    "Such a helpful book. Explains in a clear, easy to read and understandable way how our Western society has sunk into the state of moral decline that it has. Also clearly explains why the Church has been unable to counter the tide. Well laid out with each chapter having an introduction and a conclusion as well as a few helpful questions at the end. Accompanying Study Guide available if you want to go deeper.",
    "Very thorough historical background and context for where we find ourselves today."

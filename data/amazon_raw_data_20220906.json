Did very well describing the depth of his experiences and how these experiences helped him find himself. It was very touching to hear the stories of people all over the world that touched his life in many different ways. Quite an enlightening experience. If you like stories of travels this book is for you! If not travels, maybe a story of a man finding himself may interest you as well. Either way it’s a great book! Highly recommend."

    "I'm far from 100% sold on the ideas Zeihan presents, but the massive amount of knowledge he brings to the table automatically earns this book five stars.\n\nThe challenge of this book for me is trying to judge Zeihan's views on a plethora of issues I know little about. But there was one issue I did feel I could judge somewhat. As a retired engineer I read things now and then about energy issues, and it is clear to me that there is a great deal of ignorance on the part of climate activists as to the capability of alternative energy technology which exists today to be deployed in a manner which allows fossil fuels to be phased out, without reverting the human race to a stone age existence. Zeihan passed the test in that regard, because it was clear he himself is keenly aware of those limitations. (examples being the intermittency of renewable electricity sources, the very limited extent of energy storage technology to mitigate that intermittency, the problems with electric-powered transportation (mining, recycling of batteries, etc), and the fact that fossil fuels are not just used as an energy source but are used heavily as ingredients for the production of a myriad of materials such as plastic, fertilizer, asphalt, concrete, etc. which are essential to modern civilization. So the one item I felt I could competently grade Zeihan on he gets an A.\n\nTaking a broader look at what's in this book I believe the key theme is the contention that 1). The globalized economy that exists today has ushered in a golden age of economic growth for the human race. 2). The conditions that enabled the globalized economy no longer exist. 3). Therefore, the world economy will de-globalize in the coming years. 4). De-globalization will have huge consequences for the nations of the world. 5). Most of these will be adverse. 6). Some countries will be much harder hit than others.\n\nMost of the book is devoted to providing an incredibly detailed description of what these consequences of de-globalization are likely to be. As logical and filled with detailed statistical information as these are, I am inclined to believe that there is a great deal of validity to those analyses.\n\nProbably the biggest point on which I am not convinced is that of how likely is the de-globalization to actually occur in the first place. It seems like a lot hinges on the premise that security for maritime trade is an expensive proposition and if the United States abandons its role of enforcing peace on the seas through its navy then maritime trade becomes largely uneconomic and shuts down. This ushers in all sorts of consequences for the world economy. These seem very believable to me, provided that the predicted shutdown of maritime trade does actually occur.\n\nWould it really cost that much for trading nations to spend some of their tax money for maritime security, to replace the role of the US navy? And to establish regional security agreements that allow them to cost-share those expenses between the stakeholder nations?\n\nOne of the frustrating things about Zeihan's work is it seems like he is about the only game in town when it comes to geopolitics. I see video presentations of his work all over youtube. There has got to be someone out there with counterarguments. At the very least there must be some ignorant counterarguments out there, if not some valid ones. I mean, in something like politics you can find beliefs all over the map.\n\nBack to the topic at hand. Another thing I wonder about is the demographics. Zeihan seems to be very focused on the demographic transitions, i.e. relative demographics, and not on the absolute numbers of populations. I am still a believer that overpopulation is a genuine concern. And I have also been of the opinion that the demographic transitions going from a growing population to a stable one (which even Julian Simon acknowledged would have to happen at some point, although he believed the world could handle a population in the trillions), would lead to transition issues (e.g. too many retirees, too few workers), but that was just a fact of life.\n\nSo anyway, on that issue, it would be interesting if Zeihan would discuss his views on the absolute numbers regarding population, what used to be expressed in terms of \"carrying capacity\" of the environment.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that it is reasonable for there to be much less concern about overpopulation today, considering the dramatic decrease in birthrates in recent decades. What I am not convinced of is that the consequences of the demographic transition will necessarily be as dire as Zeihan believes. For example I have long believed that a shrinking workforce may turn out to be a blessing for an economy in which automation is eliminating a large number of jobs.\n\nAnother observation about Zeihan's predictions is that he focuses on what I would call the \"medium term future\". (a few decades) Longer term the fossil fuel economy will end, like it or not, as fossil fuels run out. But it's reasonable not to get much into the longer-term future, because I'm not sure there's much that can be said. About all I can say about it is I wish there were more basic research going on in alternative energy and materials sources to replace fossil fuels.\n\nOne idea which isn't particularly relevant to the book but which I have seen Zeihan discuss: The Ukraine issue. If I am interpreting his position correctly, Zeihan believes Russia has the desire to occupy portions of a number of European countries to so that it will have a more militarily defensible border. The other school of thought (Mearschiemer (sp?)) is that Russia has specific historical and security issues regarding Ukraine, and thus Putin's territorial agenda solely involves Ukraine, and probably just portions of it. Mearscheimer asserts that it's possible that Russia may have the larger agenda, but that there is no actual evidence for that belief. So it would be helpful to know what specific evidence there is for the belief that Putin has the more expansive territorial goals.\n\nBack to the book: Overall, Zeihan's book is staggeringly impressive in the wealth of facts he assembles into his picture of the world in coming decades. I hope he inspires more people to pursue the study of geopolitics so that we can get some other perspectives. Until then, Zeihan is da man.",
    "A review of The End of the World is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan. This book is not just another doomsday prophecy but rather a careful mapping of the collapse of globalization. The doomsday scenario forecast by Thomas Malthus in his 1798 book An Essay on the Principle of Population, in which he predicted that improved nutrition and healthcare would cause a population explosion and result in widespread famine. He was wrong because the result of these improvements resulted in smaller families and a dramatically improved standard of living at the same time the industrial revolution was moving families from farms for which children were an important source of labor to small crowded flats in large cities where children were a rather costly inconvenience. In their 1968 book The Population Bomb, Stanford University Professor Paul Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich predicted worldwide famine in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation, as well as other major societal upheavals, and advocated immediate action to limit population growth. Their dire prophecy did not come to pass either, because as Ehrlich later admitted; he underestimated the effects of the Green Revolution. The problem with the predictions by Malthus and Ehrlich was that they were essentially one-dimensional. Zeihan’s study is multi-dimensional and, rather than an end of the world prophecy, is an account of a process that passed the point of no return in 1980. The world that will end is not the world most of us grew up in, but rather today’s globalized world. The end of globalization and total collapse of the complex digital electronics supply chain will be due to demographic collapse rather than the demographic explosions predicted by Malthus and Ehrlich. The birthrate among cohabiting couples fell to 1.1 to 1.3 in the EU as China implemented and enforced their one child policy. It takes a birth rate of 2.3 children per couple to sustain a population demographic. Zeidan presents evidence that the demographic collapse has already begun in the EU but that it will actually strike full force first in China. Within a couple of years China will no longer have enough skilled labor to fulfill their manufactured goods orders from all over the world. In fact they are already using Uyghur slave labor. So, China will crash first, and then the EU. What about the U.S. and Japan? Japan also has an aging demographic but they have carefully outsourced their manufacturing economy to the countries in which their good are sold so they will continue to import profits from those enterprises which still have viable local markets. The US birth rate did not fall below 1.9 per couple so we are not is as bad a shape as the EU or China as our skilled Boomer generation retires, but we will really be saved by immigration of young people from Mexico. Most emigrants take two or three generations to learn a new language and assimilate but Mexicans have shown they can do it in one generation. Germany will not be able to so easily assimilate largely illiterate emigrants from Africa and the Middle East to become skilled labor in the most complex manufacturing economy on Earth. We have to realize that while Canada, the U.S., and Mexico are three different political units, NAFTA is a single economic unit. Everything we make will be made from raw materials we already have and will mostly be sold within NAFTA without complex supply chains or containerized sea transportation in or out. This is a 500 page closely reasoned book and I have just given the basic argument here. There will be worldwide ramifications in what we call the developing world which will, for the most part, return to pre-globalization pursuits as they are reduced in population not so much by famine but rather by demographic collapse in the developed world due to refusal to be fruitful and multiply.",
    "This book provides a lot of detail on the risks that our current globalized system faces - and how it will all fall down like a Jenga tower if the American brick is moved. Its worrying stuff but I think Zeihan is doing a great job of helping ordinary folk understand the situation more clearly.\n\nIt is a highly readable step forwards from Zeihans previous books. The first 3 Zeihan books - \"The Accidental Super-Power\", \"The Absent Super-Power\" and \"Disunited Nations\" significantly overlap. I read them all but by the end felt as though it was just on repeat. This book concentrates more on the likely outcomes of collapse, working accross all significant areas of human existence as made possible by global economics; energy, resources, finance, manufacturing and agriculture. It adds significantly to overall theme that Zeihan likes to explore and of all his books I think it is the best one.\n\nThis book does not cover so much the reasons why a collapse is likely. So I would recommend to read just 2 of his books \"The Absent Super-Power\" and this one to get the full picture.\n\nHe is an engaging author and the often irreverant interjections had me laughing out loud. Above all this book has really got me thinking about things in a big way.\n\nAnother review dismissed one of his books as the mutterings of a racist taxi driver. He does sometimes come accross that way, yet the book is very well researched and convincing in its arguments, despite getting some of the details wrong. For example, he says that the British political left was all but captured by fascists under Jeremy Corbyn - the reality is that there was a succesfull smear campaign to paint Corbyn as a racist by a media that supported the other party and was prepared to do their dirty work. When you read things like that you do wonder how much of the subtleties of things he misses elsewhere coming from a USA centric viewpoint. Despite that, the overall arguments he makes are pretty convincing and I feel certain that many of his predictions are likely to come true.\n\nZeihan goes against much of contemporary thinking that sees the innevitable rise of China. He is very down on China and with well thought out reasons. Current China worries are hugely over-done, and I think we should be ready to be sympathetic towards the Chinese because their suffering is likely to be immense.",
    "An entertaining read, suffused with Peter Zeihan’s black humour – and humour is something we’re going to need bags of if we are to stay sane in the dystopian world the writer portends.\nThere are two main angles to the writer’s argument. First, the end of the world order due to the United States stepping down from their role as global policeman. This will leave shipping at the mercy of pirates and nefarious states, which will break down all important trade routes and end 70 plus years of globalisation. Second, ageing populations in the developed and newly industrialised worlds will put economies into free fall as consumer spending and tax revenues dry up and pension payments consume the bare bones of what is left.\nBoth discussions are interesting but full of holes. The writer makes no mention of NATO or America’s continued military presence across the world, including in the western Pacific. I was also baffled by the writer’s insistence that Japan’s navy would protect trade routes in the Pacific. A Google search will tell you that China has not only the largest navy in the region, but on the planet. Use that information as you will.\nAs for ageing populations, Japan seems to be doing okay despite it being a model of where many countries are headed. Mr Zeihan also fails to mention immigration, which has helped increase the birth rates in the US and could do the same for ageing societies such as Germany and countries in Eastern Europe.\nReading this book, you are left with the impression that the USA is a land of milk and honey that is about to get even sweeter. East Asia and most of the developing world are staring down an abyss of famine and de-industrialisation. It does come across as a PR exercise for the US, Mr Zeihan’s home. Much as I like the place, in my eyes it is a country riven by political differences, and which seems prepared to tear itself apart.\nRead this book for the entertainment value but for a more accurate – and positive - vision of the future, look elsewhere.",
    "I could not put this book down. Peter Zeihan has weaves together a brilliant book exposing the fragility of our fossil-fuel based globalised world that just does not work without America doing its thing. Depressing, fascinating and engaging. If he is anywhere near right then our world is about to literally come crashing down.",
    "It's said that the Vatican has a letter from Britain dated AD410 asking Rome to send help (a legion or two) a problem with Saxon raiders. Rome had kept a sort of peace and allowed trade through out the empire. By AD400 this was starting to end the rich romans had lost interest and were not keen on paying their taxes. Western Europe fell into a dark age. Fast forward to now change Rome to Washington and the legions to US ocean fleets. Their my even be a e-mail on some hard drive in Washington from Britain about post Brexit blues. Life will go on of course but has Zeihan says some countries will have to have a rethink, a new dark age who knows.",
    "for a very serious book this is very easy to read, very difficult to put down and very funny through out.\nonly disapointment was his web-site does not bring the situation up to date from Feb-2022. But I suppose that material is for a future book, afterall he has to make a living."

This is a 500 page closely reasoned book and I have just given the basic argument here. There will be worldwide ramifications in what we call the developing world which will, for the most part, return to pre-globalization pursuits as they are reduced in population not so much by famine but rather by demographic collapse in the developed world due to refusal to be fruitful and multiply.",
    "This book provides a lot of detail on the risks that our current globalized system faces - and how it will all fall down like a Jenga tower if the American brick is moved. Its worrying stuff but I think Zeihan is doing a great job of helping ordinary folk understand the situation more clearly.\n\nIt is a highly readable step forwards from Zeihans previous books. The first 3 Zeihan books - \"The Accidental Super-Power\", \"The Absent Super-Power\" and \"Disunited Nations\" significantly overlap. I read them all but by the end felt as though it was just on repeat. This book concentrates more on the likely outcomes of collapse, working accross all significant areas of human existence as made possible by global economics; energy, resources, finance, manufacturing and agriculture. It adds significantly to overall theme that Zeihan likes to explore and of all his books I think it is the best one.\n\nThis book does not cover so much the reasons why a collapse is likely. So I would recommend to read just 2 of his books \"The Absent Super-Power\" and this one to get the full picture.\n\nHe is an engaging author and the often irreverant interjections had me laughing out loud. Above all this book has really got me thinking about things in a big way.\n\nAnother review dismissed one of his books as the mutterings of a racist taxi driver. He does sometimes come accross that way, yet the book is very well researched and convincing in its arguments, despite getting some of the details wrong. For example, he says that the British political left was all but captured by fascists under Jeremy Corbyn - the reality is that there was a succesfull smear campaign to paint Corbyn as a racist by a media that supported the other party and was prepared to do their dirty work. When you read things like that you do wonder how much of the subtleties of things he misses elsewhere coming from a USA centric viewpoint. Despite that, the overall arguments he makes are pretty convincing and I feel certain that many of his predictions are likely to come true.\n\nZeihan goes against much of contemporary thinking that sees the innevitable rise of China. He is very down on China and with well thought out reasons. Current China worries are hugely over-done, and I think we should be ready to be sympathetic towards the Chinese because their suffering is likely to be immense.",
    "An entertaining read, suffused with Peter Zeihan’s black humour – and humour is something we’re going to need bags of if we are to stay sane in the dystopian world the writer portends.\nThere are two main angles to the writer’s argument. First, the end of the world order due to the United States stepping down from their role as global policeman. This will leave shipping at the mercy of pirates and nefarious states, which will break down all important trade routes and end 70 plus years of globalisation. Second, ageing populations in the developed and newly industrialised worlds will put economies into free fall as consumer spending and tax revenues dry up and pension payments consume the bare bones of what is left.\nBoth discussions are interesting but full of holes. The writer makes no mention of NATO or America’s continued military presence across the world, including in the western Pacific. I was also baffled by the writer’s insistence that Japan’s navy would protect trade routes in the Pacific. A Google search will tell you that China has not only the largest navy in the region, but on the planet. Use that information as you will.\nAs for ageing populations, Japan seems to be doing okay despite it being a model of where many countries are headed. Mr Zeihan also fails to mention immigration, which has helped increase the birth rates in the US and could do the same for ageing societies such as Germany and countries in Eastern Europe.\nReading this book, you are left with the impression that the USA is a land of milk and honey that is about to get even sweeter. East Asia and most of the developing world are staring down an abyss of famine and de-industrialisation. It does come across as a PR exercise for the US, Mr Zeihan’s home. Much as I like the place, in my eyes it is a country riven by political differences, and which seems prepared to tear itself apart.\nRead this book for the entertainment value but for a more accurate – and positive - vision of the future, look elsewhere.",
    "I could not put this book down. Peter Zeihan has weaves together a brilliant book exposing the fragility of our fossil-fuel based globalised world that just does not work without America doing its thing. Depressing, fascinating and engaging. If he is anywhere near right then our world is about to literally come crashing down.",
    "It's said that the Vatican has a letter from Britain dated AD410 asking Rome to send help (a legion or two) a problem with Saxon raiders. Rome had kept a sort of peace and allowed trade through out the empire. By AD400 this was starting to end the rich romans had lost interest and were not keen on paying their taxes. Western Europe fell into a dark age. Fast forward to now change Rome to Washington and the legions to US ocean fleets. Their my even be a e-mail on some hard drive in Washington from Britain about post Brexit blues. Life will go on of course but has Zeihan says some countries will have to have a rethink, a new dark age who knows.",
    "for a very serious book this is very easy to read, very difficult to put down and very funny through out.\nonly disapointment was his web-site does not bring the situation up to date from Feb-2022. But I suppose that material is for a future book, afterall he has to make a living."

I have the previous edition and I recently learned that the authors have added a couple of new dialogue skills, so I decided to buy the new edition. I was not disappointed!",
    "I read never split the difference first, and while that book is amount the 60 I read in top 5, I found this to both integrate it well, and cover things in a more foundational way. Both are recommended. This is a book recommended to read after never split the difference, and glad I read it.",
    "This is one of the best books I have read. It breaks down the behaviors of having a successful crucial conversation. I highly recommend this item.",
    "An amazing read that will help you reframe your thinking in conversations with family, friends, and colleagues.",
    "Incredible changes in the patterns of my thinking and communicating. Already seeing improvements in my relationships just by being aware of crucial conversations, where and what my emotions are, and tools that can help.",
    "Great book-",
    "Coming off of reading a few Lencioni books this book struck me as way too long and not organized very well. Feels like the tired self help formula here. Too much sales up front - I already know the topic is important. But with meandering details and vague roadmap in the second half. So if you are doing the cut to the chase practice of finding the outline and using the book as a reference it does not work that well.",
    "In this third edition of the very popular book Crucial Conversations, the writing team behind this work expands this work's scope to further fine-tune their recommendations for helping people handle life's difficult conversations. These difficult conversations include everything from addressing marital problems to issues in the workplace and even interacting with your children. While the scope of issues that can be addressed through a crucial conversation is limitless, fortunately the recommendations this book provides for dealing with these conversations is not. Without providing any spoilers, this book uses a short menu of tactics and techniques to help readers navigate various conversations. Some techniques help address receiving unexpected, very critical, or exceedingly disturbing input while others help you to communicate such things to other people in the most constructive, least damaging manner possible.\n\nInterestingly enough, while I found the book's recommendations useful the rational behind their tactics and techniques was actually the part I found most useful. While acronyms and other memory techniques are effective at helping people learn information, I found in this case the understanding of both human behavior and how to effectively modify it (the \"why\") behind this book's recommendations very useful. Unfortunately, the memory techniques were much less so since I think they are a bit crudely crafted and could benefit from a substantial update. This is not to say any of the tactics themselves were bad, only that the memory techniques used lacked flow and the ability to really \"stick\" in one's memory.\n\nThis book is literally applicable to anyone. Unfortunately, since a lot of the really essentially dynamics it explains how to handle tend to get lost in the memory techniques they are teaching, I recommend this for adults who are in professions that require having these conversations or people with a great deal of background in them from other experience. For conversational novices, I recommend finding more basic books on decision making and conversation (and possibly influence depending upon the application). This is definitely not a bad book, but it is repetitive and a bit pedagogical they way it focusses on the techniques being taught over the reasoning behind why they work.",
    "This book is wonderful in its intent, to help people solve most sensitive problems by mastering and empowering their conversation skills.\n\nUnfortunately, it is poorly organized, drown in 'examples' and fake 'case studies' and containing a disproportionately low amount of 'why' behind the 'how'.\n\nIt is also unclear whom this book is for. More analytical people don't need the ample, repetitive and sometimes boring 'examples' - they just need a good, logical exposure of the principals with a minimal examples used as illustration.\n\nMore intuitive people might derive something from the 'examples' but still that sort of content may benefit for a bit of organization - for example, distinguishing more clearly the 'methods' from the 'examples'.\n\nThe instructive value of the book is surprisingly low. The reader still have to put significant effort to extract what is useful and applicable after closing a chapter. There are 'summaries' but they extremely dry and succint after an exhausting amount of irrelevant detail that their power is seriously diminished.\n\nIn short, the book could be reduced by 60% and lose nothing of its appeal - on the contrary.",
    "Fantastic book for the subject.\nIt is very helpful, insightful and informative. The authors use a lot of examples and case studies. Including online content and video clips. Lots of the material are on YouTube.\nHad to read it for my business course and I'm already utilising the tools.\n\nThe book is an easy read, not complicated. It could be deemed as information dense (especially with the optional bonus content), but it will keep you engaged.\n\nBy the end of the read, I guarantee, you will be able to face conversations, you would have otherwise avoided. You'll feel more equipped to execute them properly.",

    "GRAHAM REVIEW\nGraham's original work itself is fantastic, if you take the time to absorb it and understand it. It took me two reads before I really felt like I grasped it well. I don't need to write an elaborate review discussing this book for people to know it is obviously an investment classic; it has Warren Buffett's full endorsement which is the reason a lot of people opt to read it in the first place. The practical advice offered is timeless. In particular I found Chapter 1 (the difference between speculation and investing), Chapter 8 (managing your emotions), Chapter 10 (discerning the advice from others) and Chapter 20 (having a margin of safety) to be enlightening, as those four chapters were probably the most useful to me personally. The advice in the very first chapter regarding the difference between investing and speculating gets lost on a lot of people today, as anything and everything that involves stocks, bonds, options, or futures seems to be categorized as investing. The portion of Chapter 8 that discusses managing your emotions is arguably the most difficult for people to actually implement in the real world, despite being a very important concept. Graham truly makes a compelling case in favor of a value approach, which as I will discuss later in this review, is inherently reliant on the belief that investments can and do become undervalued. Buffett notes that the most significant chapters for him were 8 and 20. I agree, but also add chapters 1 and 10 to that shortened list. For others that might be different.\n\nA unique thing that I appreciated about Graham is that he discusses two different ways of investing, depending on how much time you have to put into the matter. For those who have too many other things going on to put the time into it, he advocates \"defensive investing,\" which basically focuses on safer, larger companies and is a little more bond-heavy. And for those who want to put a lot more work into it, he advocates \"enterprise investing,\" where he lays out a more rigorous approach to value investing. While the enterprising method does indeed yield greater returns over the long run, there is nothing wrong with taking the defensive approach, particularly for those who aren't able to commit enough time in order to make the enterprising method effective.\n\nThere are a few minor areas that are no longer relevant as they were in Graham's day, such as his suggestion that one should use a local bank to handle transfers of stock certificates... when it is basically all online these days. But if one reads it and remains aware that it was written in the early 1970s, then these little quirks will not bother them. I will also add that Graham places an emphasis on dividend maintenance that is probably less relevant today. In his day, strong companies actually paid out about 1/3 to 2/3 of their surpluses, whereas these days that is far less common. Graham's followers, including Buffett and Klarman, do not emphasize this so heavily (Klarman has gone as far as saying that looking at dividend policy is almost useless in today's era), although it is still probably relevant to look at the continuity of dividends especially for \"defensive\" investors. It should be added that while Graham has an almost aloof/academic air about him, he is equally humble and sincere, never underestimating the intelligence of his readers. And for those occasional uppity words that he uses, there is always a dictionary nearby. It may take more than a cursory read, but if you are patient, then this book is a gold mine. As a result, I give Graham 5 stars.\n\nZWEIG REVIEW\nJason Zweig's commentary really deserves its own separate review, as this is basically two different books. Throughout MUCH (not all) of the book, I would have given Zweig 4 or 5 stars, as his commentary adds to the discussion and thought process of Graham. However, Zweig departs from Graham in a very fundamental way in three portions of the book, causing me to believe that Zweig either truly disagrees with or otherwise does not fully understand what Graham's argument is. Zweig essentially subscribes to the \"Random Walker\" camp of those supporting a Semi-Strong version of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and believes that one is simply speculating when choosing individual stocks instead of index funds. Zweig lets his own views seep into the book slowly, chapter by chapter, until it becomes more obvious that he is not a value investor. Graham did not subscribe to this relatively recent view (only existing since the 1960s) in his approach to VALUE investing. The entire premise of value investing is that securities sometimes do become undervalued, which is rare/impossible according to proponents such as Zweig. Though to my knowledge Graham never wrote a piece articulating his stance, his actions were to the contrary of what Zweig seems to believe his position was. It's also notable that his contemporaries/students blatantly countered the EMH viewpoint (see Buffett and \"Superinvestors\" below; see also Phil Fisher in \"Developing an Investment Philosophy\" chapter 4, entitled \"Is the Market Efficient?\").\n\n(1) In the first and most notable departure for Zweig, there is a portion of the book where Graham says \"[i]t would be rather strange if - with all the brains at work professionally in the stock market - there could be approaches which are both sound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation have been based on this unlikely fact.\" (Graham, p. 380). If one reads the version in its proper context, then they will realize rather quickly that Graham is arguing that this unlikely fact of the markets actually being inefficient much of the time is actually TRUE, and is thus a compelling reason to study value investing. However... Zweig goes on in the commentary to say that Graham is pointing out that the market is efficient, and discusses the definition of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). This is clearly NOT what Graham was saying... rather the opposite.\n(2) In the second notable departure, there is a commentary chapter of Zweig's where he discusses how to effectively manage your portfolio. In the chapter itself, Graham discussed stock selection. Zweig, however, goes on to say that people should not actually pick stocks with more than 10% of their money, as doing so is akin to speculating, and should instead place all or nearly all of their funds into index funds that can come close to tying the market because of the EMH. Even though this advice MIGHT (arguably) be relevant for the \"defensive\" investor that Graham discusses (those who do not have the time or want to put the time into managing their own portfolio), this advice is a blatant misrepresentation of what Graham advises for \"enterprising\" investors (those who want to actively practice value investing) in such a fundamental way as to make me want to give Zweig 1 star instead of 5. But due to my holistic review, Zweig gets more than 1.\n(3) Zweig places an emphasis on diversification that I don't think Graham fully intended. Graham discusses the value of diversification throughout the book by taking multiple positions. Note though that Graham does NOT advocate buying everything...simply holding a few varied positions. But Zweig interprets this concept in such a way as to, in my humble opinion, advocate over-diversification... which is effectively nothing more than buying so many things that you should have just purchased an index fund to begin with.\n\nCollectively, Zweig's most significant contribution to the book was simply putting some of Graham's now-dated statements into context. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with believing in EMH in the markets the way that Zweig does, per se. But I am harsh on Zweig because advocating EMH and claiming that any stock is \"speculative\" is a blatant misrepresentation of Graham's views and stance. Despite departing from Graham quite fundamentally in two or three areas, Zweig mostly added a beneficial/informative conversation. Thus I hesitantly give him 3 stars.\n\nBUFFETT REVIEW\nWarren Buffett has a brief introduction towards the beginning of the book that tells what readers can expect from reading his mentor, Graham. As already mentioned, he places additional emphasis on chapters 8 and 20. But more importantly, there is a compelling essay/speech by Buffett in the back of the book that is called \"The Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville\" that was given at Columbia University in 1984. You don't have to buy the book to read this essay, as it is free on the internet in a few different places. But it is arguably the best rebuttal to the Efficient Market Hypothesis that anyone has ever put out, and I don't know of any EMH proponents that have ever addressed Buffett's argument. In essence, Buffett points out that many different versions of investing that have little in common with each other beyond a decidedly long-term value-driven approach have all yielded positive results over time that have had decidedly superior returns to the market. There is unfortunately little written on this topic by actual practitioners, but Buffett's argument is worth a read. It's a definite 5 stars.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs a result, I give this whole book collectively 5 stars. You can just ignore the areas where Zweig errs, sometimes rather substantially. You could safely ignore his additional chapters/commentary altogether, although I think it is useful to read for putting certain portions of Graham's writing into perspective. Entire book is recommended; but if you don't read the whole thing, at least read Chapters 1, 8, 10, and 20, as well as Buffett's essay. It's a great addition to any investment library. I know that adding those up rounds to 4, but it is Graham's book after all (much as Zweig might wish it was his)... so it's 5 stars.",
    "Since I am retired and trying to manage my own portfolio, I figured this would be the book to read. I know how to pick 4 or 5 star funds and diversify well enough, but I don't have enough theory or any formal financial background at all. I was looking for a classic book on the subject, one that a financial novice could understand, and decided to read this one.\n\nBenjamin Graham is known as the Father of Value Investing and was the mentor of Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of all time. Warren Buffett called the Intelligent Investor `the best book about investing ever written.' He believed in defensive, value investing, and famously summarized his philosphy as follows: \"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\"\n\nI found that `value investing' means that you buy only something that is being sold below its actual value, like buying dollar bills for 40 cents each, he said. One should take the quantitative (statistical) instead of the qualitative (predictive) approach, since no one can forecast the future anyway. Look at what a security is really worth in a business-like way, just like you would do for any purchase, ignoring what others might think. Do your homework is what he is saying!\n\nAccording to Graham, almost everybody, me included, does investing wrong. You are supposed to buy low and sell high, but most folks buy when the price is going up and sell when it is coming down. `Mr. Market' is very emotional and encourages stampedes toward whatever looks good at the moment, and away from investments that seem spent. This very act of buying and selling creates updrafts and downdrafts in the market which causes disparity between what the price is and what the price should be for a given investment. Eventually the true value of an investment comes to fore when things settle down. The maxim he uses for this is: the market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run. The investors `vote' for an investment which drives the price up; later, the investors find out what the investment is really worth, and the price settles into it's real value. He cited convincing examples in the tech-bubble era of the late 90's where stock prices ascended to ridiculously high levels and then came crashing down to almost nothing, and their stock shares became like Confederate money, worth only slightly more than the paper they were printed on.\n\nIn general, his theory runs counter to the speculative, get-richer-quick investing that seems standard for most of us. Stay away from gimmicks like market-timing and formula investing (chasing after perceived patterns in the market). Be boring, he says, and go for something steady and sure. Don't try to beat the market; just try to keep up with it. If you don't want to do the necessary homework, buy index funds. He touts ignored `secondary' or `unsexy' companies, the ones that don't have big names, or ones that produce boring products. It was interesting that when Graham was asked why he was unafraid of losing his edge by proclaiming value investing, he joked that his books are' the most over-read and under-used books on finances ever written'. If, indeed, everyone did value investing, there would be no bargains left out there. We are talking about something that works, but that no one wants to use!\n\nA cornerstone of the defensive investing philosophy involves building in a good margin of safety by buying investments at as far below actual worth as possible. He also talks a lot about managing risk by patience and self-control; he says: `Don't just do something, stand there!' In some sense, this book is more about the person making the investments than the investments themselves. In essence, if you want to know what risk is, look in the mirror! In other words, it's not about how much risk you can tolerate; it is about how much investigation you are willing to do. He mentioned Pascal's Wager as a graphic example of how to think of the consequences when taking on risk - - - if one wagers as to whether God exists or not, he is better off betting He does; otherwise, though the rewards could be a little better, the consequences could be eternally worse! (This was, to me, a fairly heavy-handed but instructive parallel.)\n\nWatch out for the shenanigans of the accountants when you read the financial reports. Words and phrases like pro-forma, nonrecurring charges, special charges, and good will could be euphemisms for a smoke screen. I also learned the phrase `kitchen sink accounting', which puts all possible losses into one year, which distorts the picture but gives good tax results for the company. The lesson is to not ignore the footnotes and to read the statements to the end.\n\nConsistent with his philosophy, Graham does not believe in the prevalent Efficient Market Theory (or EMH), which says that investments have the correct prices because there is so much, widespread information readily available on every investment. He basically believes, and gives many good examples, that the public is not interested in digging into the nuts-and-bolts financial information, but is only interested in what is popular. In a word, an investor needs to make sure he understands what he is investing in, and make business decisions instead of emotional decisions about it. He says that the finances are really not very complicated, and it's more about character than brain.\n\nThe first edition of this book, written in 1950 and was revised several times before Graham died in 1976. Since it was a little dated as far as market history is concerned, Jason Zweig wrote commentaries on each chapter to bring it into the 21st century. Graham, as a product of his day, talked mostly about stocks and bonds, and less about funds, and he over-emphasized, in my opinion, the importance of dividends. Zweig says that diversity has replaced value today. Also, dividends are no big deal today for most investors since the total return (NAV + dividends) is what really matters. Another thing is that Graham lived through the Depression and saw that it took 25 years (to 1954) for the market to reach the levels of pre-Crash 1929; this might have made him defensive.\n\nI'm glad I read the book. It gave me perspective on how the market works, though I'll still stick with diversity over value, especially since I invest almost entirely in funds. He did not have to scare me off on individual stocks, but he did convince me to do more homework and to try to be more business-like in my financial decisions, and - - - to look in the mirror first.",

It's very inspiring.\n\n*Book: \"You either get the idea in the first five minutes, or you don't get it at all\", said Warren Buffet in the epilogue.\n- I would add - you don't necessarily need to read all 550 pages, but you must read through the idea of value investing - and it will change your way of looking at the world.\n- I always felt confused and amazed by listening to all the ridiculous fuzz that comes from the Wall Street through TV and the internet. The book explains why.\n\n🔴Several rules I noted into my keep:\n፨ - Investor buys the business [based on its price/value], speculator buys the stock [based on an absurd believe that he can foresee where the stock price will go].\n፨ - The best way to earn adequate return without any trouble whatsoever is to invest into cheap (low maintenance cost) indexes; use dollar averaging (buy every month instead of once at a random point of time) for smoothing the luck involved.\n፨ - For enterprising investor (willing to spend much more time), look for a diversified list of bargain issues (at least 30 issues, business values (i.e. net current asset and other related metrics) is below market cap)\n፨ - During the bubble, hot industries and companies are getting overpriced. That could only be financed from somewhere. Partially that money are coming from well established old economy companies that lose the appeal. Thus, invest in such old economy companies while bubble grows, as soon as the bubble burst - undervalued companies would rise back.\n፨ - Don't ever buy IPOs! (See chapter for compelling arguments)\n፨ - Don't consider companies that do not pay dividends. Dividends - money firm pays you for providing capital, they belong to you. They cut a piece for reinvestment - payout ratio. If firm doesn't pay dividends - invest all into growth so you could profit later - that's a speculation. Moreover stock price would be more volatile because it should now rely on future rather than current prospects.\n\nThe Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, is probably the most important and influential value investing book ever written even Warren Buffet described it as “by far the best book ever written on investing”.\n\n፨ If you could only buy one investment book in your lifetime, this would probably be the one.\n፨ It had been 6 months since I last read The Intelligent Investor. I have enjoyed my personal “refresher course” in value investing.\n\n🔴Objective of The Intelligent Investor Book\n፨ Benjamin Graham’s objective was to provide an investment policy book for the ordinary investor.\n፨ He succeeded in putting seemingly hard concepts into terms that could be understood and, more importantly, implemented by the average investor.\n፨ The typical investor has a tendency to “follow the market” when they should be employing portfolio risk management strategies. Instead, Graham gives us an alternative based on fundamental stock analysis.\n\n፨ The goal is to learn how to avoid the pitfalls of allowing our emotions to control our investment decisions. Rather, Graham provides the foundation for making businesslike decisions.\n\n🔴The Intelligent Investor puts special emphasis on teaching:\n1. Risk management through asset allocation and diversification.\n2. Maximizing probabilities through valuations analysis and margin of safety.\n3. A disciplined approach that will prevent consequential errors to a portfolio.\n\n🔴If you have any Doubt regarding this Review or this Product, then Feel Free to Contact me or Just ask me by commenting below.I Hope this Review was Helpful.Write reviews, help others, happy shopping.\nThank You for Reading this Review.\n-●➽ʙʜᴀᴠᴇsʜ ʙ.ᴏ.ᴛ 🔥",
    "This book is perhaps the most important and insightful book on investing, and an eternal classic. It is not a book that promises ‘How to become rich…’ or ‘Mastering Stock market in a week….’ or ‘Beating the market made easy…’ or any shortcut to a quick buck. The book teaches three powerful lessons of how one can:\n\n- minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses\n- maximize the chance of achieving sustainable gains\n- practice emotional control and behavior to help the investor achieve full potential.\n\nThe book is about investing and having said that, investing is for the long term. Short term investing is like saying one is a spendthrift miser. While long term investors buy stocks or bonds for its intrinsic value and hold them, the 'short termers' play on its price like a video game, high on dopamine, ‘seeing price patterns’. While the intrinsic value of the security is stable, the markets, built upon the greed and fear of speculators, fluctuate widely and it is this constant flow of price movements that is the juice of speculation.\n\nThe intelligent investor is the one who estimates the value of a stock based on some key parameters like the company’s long-term prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend.\n\nGraham lists two types of intelligent investors. The ‘active’ or ‘enterprising’ who does continuous researching, selecting and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The ‘passive’ or ‘defensive’ investor on the other hand, creates a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement) argues the author so elegantly. Quoting the investment thinker Charles Ellis, ‘’the enterprising approach is physically and intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally demanding’’.\n\nFor the long-term defensive investor, who has abundant emotional courage not to be distracted by daily price movements, there is no need to look at the daily price. In fact, the investor ‘’would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would be spared the mental anguish caused by other persons’ mistakes of judgement.’’ We don’t check the price of our house every hour! The intelligent investor would make use of any opportunity if a good company is facing a temporary crisis and add more shares to his portfolio at lower price. (In cases of extreme exuberance, it is also wise to sell if the price seems too high to be real). A prudent investment methodology would be to add on more of high quality stocks on a regular basis, thus paving way for ‘dollar cost averaging’. A well-diversified stock and bond portfolio ensures long term risk mitigation.\n\nThough the book is highly acclaimed in investment circles, in practice, only a miniscule of market participants adhere to the key principles the world over. Hence, situations like the Dot com bubble, the financial crisis of the last decade and the collapse of high priced so called ‘high growth stocks’ of unworthy and nefarious companies happen repeatedly.\n\n‘’A man is known by the books he reads” said Ralph Waldo Emerson. Invest in companies that have proven track record, stellar management capabilities and high ethical standards of corporate citizenry. Being an intelligent investor is more a matter of ‘character’ than ‘brain’, is the key message of this great tome.",
    "Little hard to understand for beginners. Otherwise this book is a jewel of investing.\nPrinting, font size, paper quality all of this book is very good.",
    "Very boring and you'll have to fight your way through every page, but it's a finance book so what do you expect? I wanted to learn more about investing after covering some basics in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and this book did just that, but the basic message for me was play it safe and go for a good mutual fund, made me realise how complicated and scary investing is and made sure that I will never have the patience or enough interest to do my own investing. Please read this before starting your investing journey I'm sure it will save you some money and stress in the future whether is scares or inspires you.",
    "In the midst of sharp rises of cryptocurrency, booming stock market, it was difficult for me, as a 28-year-old, to sit down and read an \"old\" book like this one. FOMO occurred daily, but I kept reading without giving in to act to the market \"just because things are going up\". If Security Analysis by Mr. Graham is the science of investment, then the Intelligent Investor would be the art of investment.\n\nI made the first attempt to read this book 2 years ago but had failed. At that time, I knew little about the stock market, the economy, how businesses work. Much of the text made no sense to me and I had eventually given up after 4 chapters. However, after getting educated by the good folks on YouTube, I was able to give this book another try. Granted, it was still very challenging, but the value that I received from it was far greater than the literary hardship I endured.\n\nThis is not a book that will get your blood to boil with excitement; it does not have tactics that offer promises of \"do this and get rich\". If you are here for that reason, this is not the book for you. It however, guides you to approach the art of investment with the right attitude to stock prices, fluctuations, portfolio and risk. This book provides the readers immense investment experience with an attempt to shape an aspiring investor like myself with a proper mindset.\n\nMr. Zweig's commentary after each chapter are mostly helpful. There are instances that I had finished a chapter without getting much of it. The commentary then explains what Mr. Graham really meant in an easy-to-understand way. However, I did find the comparisons of different companies in one of the commentaries to be quite repeated. Most of the examples from the commentary were drawn from the dot com bubble and therefore the comparisons had rather predictable endings. Though it is still valuable to witness second hand at how bad things became when it burst.\n\nOn the literary side, the language employed was slightly historical. Many sentences required me to re-read in order to understand. I think this is a good way to practise patience, as information is so easily accessible in today's world. I also got to learn a few new words from the text.\n\nThere are a lot of online commentaries on this book, as it has become almost \"biblical\" in value investing. I recommend the readers to use these commentaries to get a modern view of Mr. Graham's concepts."

    "Mindset is another book in the seemingly endless production line of self help Psychology books available. Amazon recommended it to me based on my past purchases, and I decided to give it a try. I can honestly say that this book was eye opening for me. It’s based on the premise that there are two mindsets present in all human beings: The Fixed Mindset and The Growth Mindset. People with the fixed mindset, according to the author, are people who would rather not challenge themselves because it may reveal to them any inadequacy or weakness in their skill level or knowledge base. Conversely, people who possess the growth mindset are people who, regardless if they fail, crave the opportunity to better themselves even if it means admitting that they do not know as much as they thought they did in a particular subject or discipline. The author also dispels the myth of intelligence and natural talent, bringing to light the evidence-based realization that intelligence can be nurtured and cultivated through study and constant, unremitting learning. One’s learning ability, or intelligence, much like the brain itself, is indeed malleable. Fascinating stuff. By the way, another book in the same vein as this one is “Talent is Overrated” by Geoff Colvin. I may have reviewed it a year or two ago – I will have to check the archives of my blog.\n\nHalfway through the book I realized that I possessed traits and elements from both the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. I’m a lifelong learner, there’s no question about that. I’m ridiculed by most of my peers and friends for always reading and trying to learn more, but it’s who I am and who I've always been, unbeknownst to some. That being said, however, I can remember many times in my life when I was afraid to challenge myself because I felt like it would reveal weaknesses in my knowledge or skill. When I was younger, I used to abhor criticism; I felt like if someone criticized me it was a direct attack on who I was, so I’d respond by becoming defensive. Granted, most people will criticize you just to make themselves feel better or to put you down because they see you’re actually trying to do something; but if someone is more skilled than you are in something and he or she offers some constructive criticism, you should pay attention because that’s an invaluable tool for growth. I've learned that over the years without question. When I first started studying Karate (I was probably 11 or 12 years old), I was so full of passion for it. I used to go to my classes with a zest and zeal that rivaled the most enthusiastic of students, but I quickly realized, even though I thought I was a natural, that I had a lot of work to do before I could even consider myself a real student of the martial arts. At first I refused to accept that I wasn't as strong or as fast as I thought I was. I was stuck in the fixed mindset. I knew I was good at throwing kicks and punches because I taught myself how to fight. I didn't want to hear anything anyone else had to say. Eventually I learned the hard way that I would have to acquiesce to the instruction of my teachers, but the fixed mindset plagued me for many more years. It wasn't until I met my Jujitsu instructor about 5-6 years ago that I finally broke the fixed mindset outlook when it came to the martial arts. I was put on my back, painfully, over and over again by my instructor and learned, seemingly for the first time, about “emptying my cup” as the saying goes. I had to unlearn about 15 years of martial arts training and absorb, as a beginner, the teachings of my Jujitsu instructor. Let’s just say ice became my best friend.\n\nMy fixed mindset even found its way into my guitar studies. I was always a decent guitar player, I guess, but I didn't start growing as a guitarist until I met someone who shattered my view of my skill level while working at my last job. This guy was the most skilled guitarist I had ever met, and I was humbled by his expertise. I’m still no way near his level of guitar playing, but because of the little time I spent with him I am a much better guitarist than before I met him. It was after meeting this person that I decided to start playing with people who were substantially better than I was. I sought out guitarists all over the place and asked to learn from them. I’d walk around Union Square in the city listening to the other musicians; I'd pay real attention to what they were playing and how they were playing it. I’d walk up to a few guitarists who I thought played beautifully and pick their brains. Some were eager to teach and some didn't want to be bothered. All in all, I became good friends with two of the guitarists I met. They still reach out to me and teach me technique and theory, and, when I can, I continue my own independent music study. Growth mindset in action.\n\nI've been sending a lot of my short fiction to professional, established writer friends of mine so that they can criticize and guide me in the hopes that I can be a better writer. A few weeks ago I sent one of my short stories to a writer I work with, and I asked him to be brutal. He read my story and sent me some feedback. I felt like when I was a little kid in school and one of my teachers gave me back one of my writing assignments adorned with her red markings. \"Redundant!\" \"Comma here!\" \"Be more concise!\" \"Verb-subject agreement!\" Good times. Anyway, my colleague gave me some useful advice and I immediately incorporated his suggestions into some of the stories I've already written. Consequently, I have also asked my uncle, who is an award-winning apologetics writer, to advise me and critique my writing. He’s been generous with his time and constructive with his advice. I will keep badgering him with grammar and syntax questions until he disowns me. It’s a price I’m willing to pay.\n\nSo, back to the book. There is a lot of truth in this book, and I’m probably going to read it again soon. At the end of the book there is a chart that outlines the fixed mindset pathway of thinking versus the growth mindset pathway of thinking. It briefly outlines what someone with each mindset would do, or how they would think, given a circumstance. I have printed this chart out and I keep it hanging on my wall in my room so that I can look at it every day. I still have some fixed mindset elements that seem to permeate my thinking, but I’m more cognizant about them now. I’m working toward becoming a fully growth mindset focused person. I’m a work in progress, like most people, so bear with me.\n\nThere are a lot of case studies of some great people in this book – Famous athletes, Actors, Politicians, Musicians, Teachers, Coaches – and each case study lends more credence to the author’s message: The Growth Mindset will help you achieve whatever it is you want to achieve. It’s a great book, and I recommend it to anyone struggling with honing his or her skills in anything. The author discusses how the fixed mindset and growth mindset is evident in every facet of life. Whether it is in parenting – how some parents instill a belief in their children that they are geniuses, and these children refuse to grow because they think there is no more growing to be done – or in our professional lives - how to learn from and adapt to unethical and dishonest colleagues (something I live with).",
    "This book has several negative reviews listed first, before the good reviews. I'm wondering if they even read the book, saying it just repeats the same thing. I'm only 1/3 of the way in and I found these interesting items:\n\n- fixed/growth mindset (yours)\n- the attitude of your teacher (THEIR fixed/growth mindset can affect you)\n- praise can backfire\n\nI'm guessing that the naysayers have a fixed mindset. This is a fascinating book, which challenges me to figure out where I stand. I had a tough time in high school, struggling with B's after A's came easily in grade school. Then I went to tech school and learned computer programming, which was like I was born to it. It took a lot of work too, but it was a challenge I enjoyed, including in my career.\n\nThere is such a thing as having a natural talent at something. But hard work can help overcome the edge that those people have.\n\nThe author also talks about learning from failure. JK Rowling gave a commencement speech to Harvard where she touted the benefits of failure. She said that she had \"failed on an epic scale\" in her late twenties, but that freed her to work on the one passion she had: writing. Having a passion for something will take people farther than those who happen to be good at it.\n\nI can see several areas of my life where I could have done better, had I put in more effort. But you can't be good at everything. Sometimes it helps to know when to give up. As the Despair.com poster says, \"Not everyone gets to be an astronaut when they grow up.\"",
    "Carol Dweck's work Self-Theories. She has written another book, written for a more general, less academic readership called Mindsets, in which she applies the entity/incremental construct to a broad range of domains: business, interpersonal relationships, etc. I've read both. In Self-Theories Dweck's target are academic or educational contexts in which she argues that the difference in academic performance can plausibly be explained by distinguishing between two conceptions of ability, the entity theory and the incremental theory. According to the incremental spin, the abilities you possess are of a certain quantity which is FIXED (for all time) and therefore unalterable; which is to say your abilities cannot really be altered or changed; they are not really responsive to EFFORT. On the incremental view, abilities you possess are not FIXED and ARE RESPONSIVE TO EFFORT over time. One huge payoff, which Dweck points out frequently, is that in voluntarily adopting an incremental view of ability, you put yourself in a position to be FAR less vulnerable to self-blame, helplessness patterns, and self-despair in the event of failure, which can futher undermine your ability to execute your abilities. People of a more perfectionistic turn of mind have MUCH to gain by adopting a incremental spin on ability for the reasons just mentioned. \"An ability is only as good as its execution\"--Bandura.\n\nDwecke's an exceptionally lucid writer, and even her more academic work, \"Self-Theories\" is not written in academese but in language so clear and informal, you almost begin to wonder whether this is a professor in psychology at Columbia University. She's that good, at least I think so. (Bandura's prose is also clear, and conceptually rigorous, but his prose bears an elegant conciseness or compactness of insight, which would not incline me to describe as informal. But I digress. Long story short, the answer to your question is, I think, 'yes', Dweck's work is closely related to Bandura's.\n\nI'm not sure if Dweck's work should be seen as \"derived\" from Bandura's, however. Dweck draws three key distinctions:\n\na) between learning goals and performance goals,\nb) between helplessness pattern and task-orientedness\nc) between incremental and entity theory of ability\n\nDweck's claim is this: People who hold an entity view of their abilities TEND to also to be people who adopt performance goals over learning goals. A performance goals is one which is more concerned about \"looking or appearing smart\" than in taking steps to insure greater informedness at the cost of looking stupid or uninformed. Thus, adopting a performance goal is AT CROSS PURPOSES with a learning goal. Second, entitiy theorists, when persuaded of their own failure, have MUCH REASON TO DESPAIR over their failed performances because performance failure (for them) JUST IS a demonstration of the fact that they do not possess (and what's more NEVER can possess) the capacities required to succeed; for they believe that their abilities are FIXED structures inhering in them which are not alterable by effort. Knowing this, you'd expect that, prior to performance, entity theorists SHOULD FEEL GREAT anxiety about their future performances and ABOUT THE THREAT OF FAILURE AND WHAT IT IS DIAGNOSTIC OF. Failure is a PERMANENT DIAGNOSIS for which NATURE HOLDS NO APPELLATE COURT. If you fail at math once, twice. You're a math idiot. If you fail at a relationship; you're no good at love and romance. Period. The awareness of these prospects can't help intrude on one's performances, and keep on from doing anything which could be contrued (in your eyes) as failure, even if that means that, in the short term, you have to admit incompetence or admit nonknowledge in a subject matter, or nonunderstanding. And this is self-defeating. The situation is according to Dweck much different for those people who hold an incremental theory about ability. For these people, failure is not diagnostic of something - a wanted capability to produce desired effects in a cared-about domain of human life - which they can't EVER possess; no, failure doesn't MEAN (for them) that whatever it is in people taht allows them to produce exceptional EFFECTS in the world, in any cared-about domain of performance--that thing, call it an \"ability\"--is something whose possess and \"size\" or quantiy or magnitude is something over which you can exercise some control over and the way you can do this is through EFFORT. The entity theorist does not see personal exertion as diagnostic of LOW ability; she sees it as the MEANS to ACQUIRE greater capabilities, a means to enhance her personal causation. By contrast, the entity theorist views exertion as diagnistic of Low ability; like a doctor who sees a patient and says \"Those spots mean measles,\" the entity theorist views exceptional effort to mean \"low ability.\"\n\nBandura's view (in SE) is, similar to Dwecks, in that he thinks that it is functionally optimal to view abilities as developmentally responsive to effort. Abilities ARE things one possesses - powers one can personally exericise to produce desired effects in the environment - but for learners it is self-limiting to think of abilities as innate or in-born capabilities rather than as things which can be obtained though \"acquireable means\" and guided mastery. Bandura's general approach to learning seems to be that complex or difficult performances can be decomposed into simpler tasks; learners can learn and gain competence at the simpler tasks (increasing perceived self-efficacy incrementally as they go), then, once actually in possesion of those simpler skills, move on to tackle more difficult tasks, and so on until they actually possess the skills to perform the complex performances. This is what goes on in med schools, trade schools, most all graduate schools. On B's view, abilities are entities you possess, but the trick is to incrementalize your ACQUISITION OF THEM, using your skills acquired at lower and medium levels to boot youself up to higher levels. But of course, this means your conception of your ability has to be adequate to get you to the highest level of performance, or you have to locate the means and strategies which will elevate your performances to higher levels, and once these are identified you have to acquire them. And acquiring competency in the simpler tasks, lower skills, are, so far as I can tell from SE, the means to acquiring the skills to perform at higher levels; which is as much to say they are the means to acquiring greater abilities.",
    "This was a wonderfully thought-provoking, insightful book that really opened up for me the differences between a fixed and growth mindset. I read this book in preparation of becoming a mindset coach and will draw upon it as I pursue my goals.",
    "Repetitive to the point of exhaustion.\n\nFelt more like an attempt at brainwash than anything really interesting.\n\nI will save you all the money and tell you the final conclusion:\n\nPeople can continue to learn and get smarter.\nIQ is not a fixed thing and can constantly be improved by anyone.\nAnyone who believes otherwise or that they are special are in a \"fixed mindset\".\nAnyone who believes they can improve their intelligence/skills/knowledge is in a \"growth mindset\".\n\nGrowth mindset is better than fixed mindset.",
    "I came across this book while reading bounce by Matthew Syed, and also outliers by Malcolm gladwell. However the forementioned books provide a much more succinct and effective synopsis of the growth mindset, both great reads. I found that this book was very badly structured, making it a hard read, plus the author seemed to repeat herself over and over again",
    "Carol's book is an excellent exploration of what it takes to become better, at anything. An inspirational philosophy that shifts away from ideas of \"I'm great/terrible\" and towards \"I can improve no matter where I am\".\n\nEven if you don't agree with every argument made in the book (I didn't) it's a thought-provoking read nonetheless. Especially useful for people who have strong ideas around their \"natural talents\".\n\nI can safely say I'll be taking many of the ideas in this book with me into the future - optimistic and practical.",
    "This book makes a very valid point on the importance and differences of a growth mindset vs a fixed one...but it could be literally summarised in a few pages. Instead you get 300 pages of examples for different life situations that in essence make the same point...it's really a drag to read and would have been better if the author used the pages to provide perhaps more verbal guidelines of how to 'speak' in business, parenting, relationships with a growth mindset terminology (verbs, nouns, concrete phrases based on different life situations) vs just reinforcing the same point over and over again based on known to her examples or research.",
    "Amazing book I highly reccomend. Bought an audio before and this one for anybody else"

    "”Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,” by Ray Dalio, explains why the United States succeeded in becoming the dominant country in the world. It also explains why the United States is in decline, and more ominously, why Communist China is ascending.\n\nDalio’s book is refreshingly free of the ideological biases that often distort an explanation like this. Typically one blames what is universally deplored on what one personally dislikes. Howard Ruff’s “How to Prosper During the Coming Bad years,” was published in 1979, when everyone was worried about inflation.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UE3ODN950AAJ?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp\n\nRuff blamed the stagflation of the late 1970’s on welfare spending (he included Social Security and Medicare as welfare) and the sexual revolution. Most Republicans took the lead of Milton Friedman, and blamed Keynesian economic policies. Republicans had never liked Keynesian economic policies because those policies shifted wealth, power, and prestige from the business community to the government.\n\nI blame the stagflation of the 1970’s on rise on the world price of petroleum that followed the OPEC Oil Embargo of 1973, and the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Keynesian economic policies were not designed to respond to the shortage of a natural resource essential the the U.S. economy. Moreover, during the Great Depression the problem was deflation, not inflation. Republicans did not want to blame the OPEC Oil Embargo and the Iranian Revolution because they did not want to admit that foreigners they disliked had considerable control over the U.S. economy, and they did not want to admit that America’s reliance on automobile transportation was a national problem.\n\nRay Dialio sees the growing income gap as a problem. Because he is a self made billionaire investor who has made more money than Howard Ruff knows exists, he his opinions about economic inequality cannot be dismissed as “the politics of envy.”\n\nDialio’s main concern is with the rise of China and the decline of the United States. He also discusses how the Netherlands and Great Britain passed through the same cycle he claims that China and the United States are passing through. He mentions earlier nations which previously dominated the West, or the world. These include Macedonia, Rome, the Arabs, the Mongols, China, and the Ottoman Turks. With the exception of China, these never regained world dominance after they lost it.\n\nDialio claims that dominant nations go through six stages:\n\n“Stage 1, when the new order begins and the new leadership consolidates power;”\n\n“Stage 2, when the resource – allocation system system and government bureaucracies are built and refined.”\n\nIn the first two states the people of a soon to become dominant nation interact harmoniously. They work hard, save their money, and stay out of debt personally, and nationally. Those who perform well are rewarded, but economic inequality does not reach high levels.\n\n“Stage 3, when there is peace and prosperity.” During this time the descendants of those who lived through the first two stages become less interested in saving money and more interested in spending it, and enjoying life.\n\n“Stage 4, when there are great excesses in spending and debt, and the widening of wealth and political gaps.”\n\n“Stage 5, when there are very bad financial conditions and intense conflict,” and finally,\n\n“Stage 6, when there are civil wars/revolutions.”\n\nDalio believes that China is passing from Stage 2 to Stage 3, and that the United States is in Stage 5.\n\nThis scenario does not explain the American Revolution and the American Civil War. Neither was preceded by bad economic times. Efforts by the British Parliament to make the colonists pay their share of the costs of the French and Indian War were irritating to the colonists, but not impoverishing. The British victory in the French and Indian War created economic opportunities for the colonists.\n\nSimilarly, the decade leading up to the American Civil War was not a time of economic decline and distress. Few whites in the North would benefit economically by freeing the slaves. Most whites in the South would benefit economically if the slaves were freed. Family farms in the South could not compete with plantations worked by slaves. Nearly every skilled trade and profession paid less in the slave states than in the free states.\n\nNevertheless, more Americans died during the American Civil War than in all the other wars the United States has fought. The American Revolution and the American Civil War happened for reasons not explained in this book. Moreover, the Netherlands and Great Britain never passed into Stage 6. Nevertheless, Dalio’s postulated sequence does seem to explain what has been happening to China and the United States.\n\nChina is the only nation that has recovered from national declines. He provides a chart that shows that a cycle happened in each Chinese dynasty. I think another reason the dynasties rose and fell was because of problems inherent with the dynastic principle. Dynasties have been established by men who are charismatic, effective political leaders, and military geniuses.\n\nWith each generation the man who inherits the throne is likely to be progressively less talented than the man who created it. This is due to a well understood genetic phenomenon called “reversion to the average.” Exceptional characteristics are caused by rare and recessive gene alleles that are unlikely to match in the children of exceptional parents.\n\nThe Chinese benefit from a characteristic not mentioned in this book. Everywhere they live Chinese tend to be intelligent, obedient to the law, and monogamous. This is true even when they are poor and persecuted.\n\nThis gives the Chinese nation the ability to recover quickly from the bad decisions of incompetent leaders. It enables them to respond quickly to the good decisions of competent leaders, like they are doing now.\n\nThis also gives the Chinese nation an advantage over a multi racial country like the United States. We include races with average characteristics not conducive to creating and maintaining successful societies and civilizations. When the United States was ascending, ninety percent of the population was white. Most blacks were restricted to second class citizenship, despite the obvious intentions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n\nWhile the Chinese are perfecting their meritocracy we are using affirmative action programs to achieve diversity, inclusion, and equity. These in turn advance people to positions where they are unable to perform adequately. While Chinese geneticists are looking for gene alleles that influence intelligence, we pretend that the assertions in “The Bell Curve,” are pseudo science, and that “Race is only a social construct.”\n\nDiversity is not our strength: it is the main reason for the political polarization that makes it difficult for us to solve problems that would have been manageable before 1964.\n\nLike every sensible American, and unlike the insensible Americans I sometimes encounter on the internet, I hope America avoids a civil war or a revolution.\n\nI also expect China to achieve world hegemony by the end of this century, if not sooner. I hope that by the time this happens the Chinese mainland will have adopted a democratic government. The success of democracy in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan persuades me that democracy would work well on the mainland.\n\nMy love for the Chinese people and culture, although not for the present dictatorship, makes me sanguine about a world dominated by a democratic China.",
    "In this book, Dalio presents his model of the rise and fall of \"empires\". The closer it gets to the present day the more interesting the book is. The last three chapters of the book which deal with the rise of China, the current tensions between China and the US, the United States's alleged decline and Dalio's conjectures regarding the future are five stars. The build up to the final three chapters is decent, although only occasionally riveting: The book is only three stars before the strong close.\n\nIt is hard to evaluate the merits of Dalio's historical model given that he is only presenting it at moderate depths so as to introduce it all in one volume. The model says that empires rise and fall, no surprise, and talks about the interplay of economic, internal, and external factors that take an empire through the cycle. Dalio also mentions that inside the Big Cycle there are other cycles, and inside those cycles other cycles. He does not, however, go into much detail regarding the sub-cycles. This sounds reminiscent of Robert Prechter's Elliot Waves or perhaps, even, pre-Copernican astrology. Is this a model so loose, like Elliot Waves, that it can be found to fit anything that could happen? Is it falsifiable? Along the way was the validity tested by approaching an empire that there was little prior knowledge of to make \"forward predictions\" regarding what would happen? Has Dalio merely cherry picked the three examples which best seem to demonstrate the soundness of the model while omitting more problematic cases? There is not enough in this book to do a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe United States Civil War is a good example of something I had trouble thinking about in terms of the model. According to the model the final stage in an empire's breakdown is civil war or revolution. In the case of the United States, however, the Civil War occurred while the United States was still ascendant: in stage 2 out of 6 with stage 3 being the peak. Certainly there was no debt crisis which caused the Civil War and the United States had little going on in terms of external conflict at the time. So perhaps that could have been taken as a \"prediction\" that the United States would almost certainly have survived the Civil War in tact? The truth, however, is that the South came very close to winning the Civil War, in the sense of being recognized as independent, according to McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom.\n\nAnother thing that I am not sure how to evaluate using the model is the United States after the Civil War and after the Revolution. Although these were periods of rebuilding they do not seem to fit well into Dalio's model. After victory in these conflicts Americans were very magnanimous (as it was later after World War II). Far from being purged those who were on the wrong side of history ended up facing rather little in the way of consequences. So how does this fit into the model? Obviously, there will be some \"rebuilding\" after a Revolution or Civil War so is the model just saying there will be something which could not not happen? Indeed although the United States was vibrant after the Revolution, the period after the Civil War as described in Richard White's The Republic for Which it Standards seems in decline compared to the Antebellum period. According to Dalio's model, however, the United States was stage 2 rising into stage 3 during this period.\n\nRegardless of the merits of the model, which would probably require many in depth books to evaluate fully, there is definitely some good high level overviews of Chinese, European, and American history. There are many interesting charts and statistics thrown in.\n\nAs mentioned, the close of the book is far and away the best part of it. Dalio describes the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese people and their different outlooks toward governing. Dalio does not seem to be pushing any political agenda, at least not too hard, but rather what he has carefully measured to be objectively true. Although clearly an admirer of much about China, he is also willing to criticize some aspects of China. At the same time, his criticism omits its surveillance state.\n\nLooking forward Dalio presents some very interesting charts and statistics regarding America's growing internal conflicts. He even has a graph to show how bad it is now compared to early points in history. Dalio is willing to stick his neck out and quantify what his model is predicting as the probability of civil war in the United States and the probability of military war with China in the next decade.\n\nAlthough very thought provoking overall, one particularly persistent problem throughout the book is that many of the charts are very hard to read. There are graphs with eight different lines with some of the colors very hard to distinguish between. The book also almost never references its sources. Indeed, given how much history Dalio has obviously studied, a bibliography, or at least a list of recommendations, would be very nice.\n\nDalio is very repetitive regarding the inevitable death of fiat currencies through money printing. At the same time he also does provide concrete advise of how to prepare. He gives some definite timelines and the dates are very close. To qualify this, somewhat, however, his company Bridgewater Associates has basically had a \"lost decade\" using his models to generate any kinds of returns since his departure around 2012. Nevertheless it is interesting to think about whether or the US is on the verge of multiple simultaneous crises.",
    "I bought this book because I admire Ray's views in his book Principles.\nI read Changing World Order twice, analyzing and thinking over many passages and charts.\nHere is my short opinion:\na) the first part of the book \"How the world works\", I thought, gives an excellent overview of the history of the world, and the dynamics between world powers\nb) the 2nd and the 3rd part of the book appears to show Ray's heavy admiration towards China with hand-picked evidence to support his case.\nHere is why I think so:\na) In dozens of passages, Ray appears to focus on some negative dynamics in the US and not discuss similar negative dynamics in China.\nIn other words, Ray doesn't seem to compare apples to apples in the narrative.\nb) When looking at the charts, Ray appears vague about the data on which some charts were built.\nI couldn't judge the validity of the chart because I didn't see what went into the compound data shown in the chart.\nThere are so many examples of this in each chapter that it made me doubt the validity of 2/3 of the content I'm reading, let alone the conclusions Ray is drawing. A bit disappointed. I felt that I gained more from reading Changing Fortunes, which describes the history and dynamic between US and Japan economic relationships back in the '80s.",
    "Ray Dalio mais uma vez escreve uma obra compartilhando parte de seus conhecimentos adquiridos por meio de experiência, que supera expectativas. Este livro quando permite ao seu leitor ter uma compreensão mais ampla sobre economia mundial em função dos acontecimentos da história e como isto se manifesta no mundo atual - na relação entre impérios no passado e países no presente -, para tanto entendermos fatos que os conectam à prosperidade financeira ou ruína, como também para investidores reconhecerem sinais que lhes permite compreender a situação econômica mundial e assim elaborar suas estratégias de investimento para obter maiores êxitos. Para aqueles que leram \"Big Debt Crisis\" escrito por ele, este livro será uma extensão natural dos assuntos e sobretudo uma ampliação de horizontes sobre economia mundial e investimentos financeiros.",
    "He estudiado ciencias políticas y economía toda mi vida y nunca he leído tantas imprecisiones juntas . Si te interesa la coherencia, lógica o rigor, te vas a equivocar con este libro. En vez encontrarás muchas referencias a “causas y efectos\" (desconocidos por los demás), “mega movimientos sociales y económicos (\"cuyos rasgos solo se pueden describir grandes pinceladas”), “mi profundo conocimiento de la historia de los imperios”, “mi gran experiencia como inversor” etc. En otras palabras fuera de muchos conceptos que solo él dice que puede descifrar, aquí no vas a encontrar mucho mas de rigor científico o interés.",
    "Another master piece by Ray. Personally I believe this book is great, but not limited for:\n- building a fundation of understanding the waves of cycles and developments\n- gaining a different thought prospect when observing events\n- learning how to put together an effective system for research and study",
    "While the past has been accurately examined, the enormous contingencies we are witnessing the last three years makes me doubt on the future vision. There are many avalanches at sight that might profoundly change current practices to deal with climate change, domestic energy sources, military spending, food production and health care. Current social institutions are not responding fast enough to all these exploiting unattended concerns of the whole population."

    "I enjoyed the author’s approach; creating a fictional company and scenario, that could be any company, at any level.\n\nThe pacing was well handled and the overall message was clear. This has already started me thinking about how teams I work with can improve together.",
    "Cuts through the politics, empire building and brown nosing we've all seen, and creates effective teams. Builds on positive human behaviors and communication.",
    "I picked up Lencioni's book on the advice of several manager/executive friends. I take their opinions seriously, so I set myself down to absorb everything in this book. Ultimately, what I absorbed is that Lencioni simply does not know what he's talking about.\n\nThe first problem is Lencioni as an author. He presents his case first in the form of a short story that has a 100% happy ending for Kathryn, the newly hired leader and protagonist of the story. It's a self-centered tale told from only a single point of view that gives no insight into the consequences of Kathryn's decisions one way or the other.\n\nThe second problem is Kathryn is treated as a cipher for good management, though she does not demonstrate it. In this very, very short story, Kathryn manipulates her way around her team, figuring out how to push their buttons to get them to do what she wants. Rather than coming out and requiring specific performance and being open about what she sees, Kathryn engages in double-talk, withholds valuable information, openly plays favorites, happily creates chaos, and gets a pat on the back from a board member who never holds her accountable. If I didn't know better, I would think the author was acting out some kind of fantasy to heal old wounds at a failed management endeavor.\n\nThe final problem is that the book and its points are utterly obtuse. The story consumes 80% of the book. The worksheet and associated instructions comprise the remaining 20%. This is less required reading and more a fatally flawed jumping off point to terrible management.\n\nThe book specifically suggests:\n\n- A team can achieve anything if they're \"all rowing in the same direction.\" While it's a cute sentiment, it does nothing to actually explain the vision of this book.\n- Managers should be free to cut each other down, as long as its done via calling out someone on their missed deadlines (even though they are not personally responsible for managing those deadlines), and other passive-aggressive tactics.\n- Everyone should reveal deep personal details about themselves, ignoring all respect for privacy. (For those who think this point is harsh, remember that Lencioni's innocent low-risk questions only apply to people who are perfect. For anyone who is an actual human, being interrogated about details that have no place in a work environment is deeply disrespectful and borderline psychpathic.)\n- It should be up to anyone but the actual boss to decide what the goals are. Just think for a minute about how well this would fly at Apple or Tesla.\n- Everyone should sacrifice their personal goals in favor of the \"team\" goals. That's right. You don't get to think about your career. You don't get to decide what is and what is not best for you. Don't like it? Get out. Why would anyone ever want to work for a boss who thinks like that? That's a team killer is what it is. It's a philosophy of pure poison.\n\nThis is a book written by a mediocre consultant who will help you achieve mediocre results at best. This book is the opposite of \"A players want to work with A players.\" It's a cast of B and C players who behave more like children than professionals. It's simply not realistic.\n\nMickey is the perpetual debbie downer who rolls her eyes at everything. Sorry, if Mickey was this bad in real life she would not have risen to the level she is at. Here's a more realistic picture: if I were Mickey I would roll my eyes, too. She's absolutely justified in the contempt she has for the clueless board above her, and for her do-nothing co-workers. The story admits that Mickey produces outstanding marketing material. She's quick, efficient, and she takes great care of her team. Even when she's facing termination for insubordination, she deftly negotiates herself a severance. Yet the story throws Mickey under the bus and paints her as a toxic saboteur instead of the A player she is.\n\nMartin the senior engineer slash developer is another A player ground into submission by Kathryn who admits -- ADMITS -- she does not understand technology and has never led a technology company before. Yet, here she is, telling Martin how to do his job and publicly chastising him for using his laptop during a meeting -- something Martin points out is standard procedure and doesn't bother anyone but Kathryn. This is poison! A leader should be intimately familiar with a company's products, inside and out. Do you think Elon Musk doesn't know how batteries work? Do you think Carly Fiorina doesn't know how toner and fusers work? (Well, maybe she doesn't. She single handedly ruined HP.) The point is, no one can respect a leader who doesn't have at least a general understanding of what she's been asked to lead.\n\nThe rest of the cast is what you would expect from a mediocre team: a manager who can't manage unless he has a bullet point agenda, a do-it-all guy who has no initiative of his own, a couple of D- level people who only left because they were probably hired by C- level managers. Everyone sounds like a desperately out of touch boomer or generally clueless GenX at best. There is no trace here of actual managers you might encounter in your career. It's grotesque in its poor representation of what a modern team looks like.\n\nThis is a book that tells a convenient story in favor of a consultant's business proposition. It's more than a little like a proselytizer who also happens to sell Bibles. In other words, this book is snake oil. Like other reviews have pointed out, there's no data to back up the book's assertions. There is no real world analysis and comparison. There is no admittance of flaw anywhere. This is a book that teaches leaders to demonstrate vulnerability, but presents itself as utterly invulnerable. Lencioni is God, and this is his Infallible Word.\n\nActually, I encourage you to buy and read this book. While it won't help you succeed, it will help you recognize incompetence (especially in consultants) and avoid it.\n\n=========================================\n\nUpdate: I took this book back to the people who recommended it to me. I asked them what specific lessons they absorbed and put into practice in their own companies. After some awkwardness, I found that no one actually implemented anything from this book. They just read it and fell for the glowing story. This book isn't a treatise, or even a lesson. It's fan-fic that CEOs and entrepreneurs drool over the same way your assistant drools over new office supplies.\n\nIt took me four hours to read this book. That's four hours I'm never getting back.",
    "This has to be the best book on team development I have read. I am not into the fable books but this book tells a story and then harnesses the lessons learned the how too and true why behind it. Fantastic! I highly recommend this book.",
    "Great book that helps guide leaders build and facilitate strong teams. The characters were very relatable, especially in a top heavy start up environment.",
    "I have an aversion to business fables. The ones I've read give me the irrates. They seem to trivialise business.  Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life  , Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions (Kotter, Our Iceberg is Melting)  , Fish!  and  Squirrel Inc.: A Fable of Leadership through Storytelling  all left me a little cold. So it was with some trepidation that I picked up The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Fable by Patrick Lencioni.\n\nFive Dysfunctions popped up on my radar a couple of years ago and ever since then a number of people suggested I should read it. It was published back in 2002 and there seems to be quite an industry that's grown around it with addional handbooks and resources available. For me, this wasn't a good sign.\n\nThen a client lent me a copy so I started on a plane trip home from Sydney and finsihed the book in three short sittings. It's a nicely crafted story: short chapters, cliff hangers, good dialogue and believable and messy business situations.\n\nMost of Five Dysfunctions is a business story. About a third of the book, at the end, describes the five dysfunctions model. The story is about Kathryn who joins DecionTech as their new CEO. The executive team is a bit of a mess and they don't welcome her with open arms. Kathryn starts a process of conversations and straight talking at a series offsites and team meetings and engages the Executive in understanding a simple model showing what needs to happen to turn their group into a team.\n\nLike all good models it's nice and simple and can be drawn on a whiteboard.\n\nEach part of the model is interlocked. It's pointless working on one part without addressing the others.\n\nOne of the real advantages of learning about the model as a story is that you hear from the characters ask and answer questions. You are a fly on the wall of an executive team and you learn through their experiences. This experiential learning is then reinforced with the didactic chapter at the end of the book.\n\nHere's how Kathryn describes the five dysfunctions.\n\nAbsence of Trust: \"Great teams do not hold back with one another.\" \"They are unafraid to air their dirty laundry. They admit their mistakes, their weaknesses, and their concerns without fear of reprisal.\"\n\nFear of conflict:\"If we don't trust each other, then we aren't going to engage in open, constructive, idealogical conflict. And we'll just continue to preserve a sense of artifical harmony.\"\n\nLack of commitment: \"I'm talking about commitment to a plan or a decision, and getting everyone to buy into it. That's why conflict is so important.\" \"It's as simple as this. When people don't unload their opinions and feel like theyre been listen to, they wont really get on board.\"\n\nAvoidance of accountability: \"Once we achieve clarity and buy-in, it is then that we have to hold each other accountable for what we have signed up to do, for high standards of performance and behaviour. And as simple as that sounds, most executives hate to do it, especially when it comes to a peer's behaviour, because they want to avoid interpersonal discomfort.\"\n\nThe last dysfunction, Inattention to Results, is all about putting the team before individual egos. This issue is handled over a number of chapters at the end of the fable but I wont go into detail and spoil the surprise.\n\nWhat I really liked about this book was just how well written the story was so are immersed in the world of an executive team and see the tensions and compromises, their good itent and judgements, and how conflict arises and can play out. There're plenty of models of good and poor behaviour, and our hero, Kathryn, shows us one way progress can be made.\n\nWhat struck me most was just how much time is needed for an effective team to spend together planning, discussing, arguing. The perenial push back to spending this time, however, is that tired business phrase, \"we just need to get back to the real work.\" Well, here's the breaking news for any executive who wants their company to excel: it's your first priority to build an effective executive team so it can draw on all its talents to achieve results.\n\nI loved this book and have been recommending it all over the place. Get a copy, read it, then pass it on to another executive who you think really needs to get their team back on track.",
    "Teamwork principles written in a novel format. Fun to read and inspiring. Also some practical methods at the end of the book.",
    "I first read this book in 2008 and applied the concepts with my team at that time. As a result, we became a strong team, did great work, received an innovation award from a leading tech company, and our work was featured in industry publications. I’ve used Patrick’s 5 Dysfunctions framework in successive roles to build teams that were highly performing and fun to win with. This framework works!",
    "Rather than a factual story, like many business books, Patrick writes his books as novels. Similar to “The Goal” by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. In this book, Kathryn is parachuted into a highly dysfunctional team and we work with her to bring the team from one that is working against each other, to a high performance team. We work through the five dysfunctions; Absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and attention to results.\n\nIt;’s easy to read and I’m sure you will recognise many of the characters and dysfunctions, in fact you have probably worked with many of them.",
    "This book is a leadership novel rather than a hard jargon overloaded leadership book.\n\nI brought 14 to accompany our leadership programmes and it was met with resounding approval!\n\nHere’s their feedback....\n\nWhat have I not learnt from this book is a better question!\n\nGood, easy to read and very thought provoking.\n\nMore interesting than any other leadership book I’ve read!",
    "Fantastic book. Its different in that it reads like a fiction story but just in a business sense. You will learn the journey of a newly appointed CEO that makes changes and how these are discussed and brought up.\nIt doesng to into unnecessary detail which kept me really engaged from start to finish.\n\nIt just makes sense as well. And I can really identify all of this with my work situation. As an HR Manager I found this really useful in approaching a pretty similar situation and articulating what I have identified in a really straightforward and clear way. Thank you Patick Lencioni!",
    "This book was recommended to me by one of the delegates at a recent training. It sounded great and Stephen (the delegate in question) was so enthusiastic about how it helped him understand his team and work more effectively that I just had to pick up a copy and read it. I am glad I did. Patrick Lencioni adopts a \"commentary\" style and follows Katheryn, a 57 year old executive who is a surprise appointee as a new CEO with responsibility of turning the fortunes of DecisionTech, a technology company, around. It focuses on the stakeholders in the management team and how the dynamics work between each of the players. Flicking back through it it seems a bit cold and shallow but while reading it I was totally caught up in the story and wanted to know how each of the players would react to the unfolding events. You will recognise characters, the situations, the meetings and companies you have worked in. It will remind you of times that you have taken unhelpful positions and it is the style that does that to you. The learning outcome is a useful pyramid model that can assist any manager in bringing a team together. All in all, an engaging book that provides insight and learning that makes it an essential read for progressive managers who believe they really can change things. Is that you?",
    "Although warmly recommended by many sources, I was not deeply influenced by this book. I do feel that there is something innovative in the presentation as it follows rather the structure of a novel that a typical non-fiction book but to me the story was not very convincing."

    "I'm about halfway through the book at this point and so far the information has been great. I wish I had read this years ago before I was promoted to a senior-level management role in a company that I had been with for over a decade. I made so many mistakes because I simply did not understand that the skills required in the new role would differ greatly from those skills that made me successful in my previous roles. I was not prepared for the changes and quickly got frustrated, and ultimately ended up getting let go from a company I called home for almost 12 years. Had I read this book prior, I would have been asking the right questions and gone into the role with a different point of view. I definitely would have been more prepared and likely would have thrived in the new role. I recently changed companies and have used the lessons from this book to prepare, so wich me luck! :)",
    "This book helps people handle transitions into a new company or a new role. It provides a framework (dubbed STARS) for properly diagnosing the situation we are landing in, and a set of tools (e.g. negotiate expectations, create alliances, create org. alignment, identify early wins, map influencers, etc) and guidelines for what to focus on given our initial diagnosis.\n\nI wouldn't say that the advice or insight here is groundbreaking or unintuitive, but the book’s value resides in officiating as a checklist, spurring thought and intentionality during the early phase of a job transition. Some of the content, related to creating a strategy, seeking organizational alignment, and building a team, are worth revisiting since these challenges can arise at any point.",

    "About 5% of the leaders who seek help from me about imposter syndrome, don't have imposter syndrome at all.\nThey are really lacking the skill of starting a new role.\n\nBecause good leadership is often considered a 'natural talent', wrongly I might add, these leaders think it's just them, that they're not a good enough leader. It causes huge stress and holds them back from stellar careers.\n\nFor these leaders, I always recommend 'The First 90 Days' because the book's implicit message is 'leadership is a skill'. I'm grateful for that.\n\nBut more importantly, Michael Watkins lays out a framework and a strategy for excellence in a leadership transition. Even 'soft skills' like company cutlure and politics.\nFabulous book, and if you're starting a new role, read it now.",
    "Starting a new role is always an anxious time. I wanted to present a considered and structured approach, and sought suitable literature to learn best practice. This book provides a comprehensive guide to starting a new role, but if anything I think it's a bit too long and labours the point. I was hoping for more of a template with critical areas to cover, but after 200 pages, much is repeated, it's padded with overlapping 'case studies' and it becomes tedious to finish. But all credit to the author for what has probably become the leading reference in this area.",
    "Transitioning to a new role can cause anxiety and stress for weeks, but this book by Michael Watkins helps diagnose your situations, define the core challenges, and design plans to create momentum which results in a more successful and comfortable transition.\n\nHundreds of thousands of leaders have benefited from this approach, which independent research has shown reduces time to break-even by as much as 40%.\n\nThe book includes case studies of failed transitions and clearly explains how to avoid them by preparing yourself, setting your boundaries, listening, learning, collobrating, creating alliances, securing early wins and managing yourself.\n\n\"Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting)\"...\n\n...this nugget from the book is equally true even when you're not transitioning to a new role.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this book.",
    "Are you starting a new role and onboarding or just been promoted?\n\nThis book is the blueprint you need to be make a success in the first 90 days\n\nWith proven strategies, check lists, evaluation tools, it has chapters on what to do and chapters on not what to do. How to understand people, build alliances, how to build your team and how to manage yourself.\n\nIt’s a book you can keep coming back to as you move through your career.\n\n“The First 90 Days” is a book I’ve been searching to read for years.",
    "Due to moving countries and leaving behind my books each time I have had to purchase this book yet again. That goes to say something about it though. For anyone changing roles within a company or externally, I would highly recommend reading or in some cases, like mine, re reading the first 90 days. It will help remind you what it's like to restart and keep you on the rails."

    "The EOS system and the valuable implementation resources in this book have helped us transform our business and free my time in an incredible way. We are only 3 months in to implementing this book and we are seeing excellent results.",
    "Excellent scaffolding for building a holistic business that is an entity of its own, not an appendage of the entrepreneur.",
    "It is the best investment. Right on spot. Highly recommended!",
    "Gino created a phenomenal read for business owners across the globe. This book is mainly for business without proper infrastructure. However, it certainly gives direction for businesses that do as well.\n\nOverall, if you are in the realm of business at all this book is for you to read. You can always gain more nuggets and be better at what you’re currently doing. Thanks Gino!",
    "Seriously, read this book and follow it to the letter. Get your boss, or even better, your bosses boss to read it.",
    "Everything is amazing step by step easy to follow",
    "If you work or are in business you need to read this book. This is by far the best and most logical book on creating a happy and functional work environment. I am so glad I read it. And the interesting thing about this book is that what you learn about change in the workplace is pretty easy to put in motion. It's not like other books that require a paradigm shift that interrupts the team. Erase everything you thought you knew about creating an interdependent Workforce. Now read the book. It's an easy read. And it will change your life. Boom.",
    "We are a non-profit organization who has adopted the Traction method and seen the way our company has improved on so many levels - customer journey, employee journey, achieving corporate goals, meeting efficiencies, documenting processes, innovation . . . . The list is too long! I highly recommend this as a read for leaders at all levels, specifically senior leaders who can then become implementation champions! We currently provide each leader and individual contributor with a copy of the book in their NH swag bag. We have developed a course that covers how we apply the Traction model and how they can use the tools to be success in their roles. Our next phase is to create a course for staff at all levels which will be part of the onboarding journey and include a copy of the book in swag.",
    "I can understand why some ambitious entrepreneurs and business owners love this book. Its operating system makes a great deal of sense at a high level. While Michael Gerber's classic small business book \"The E-Myth Revisited\" presents some similar ideas, this is much detailed and more of a \"how to do it\" guide.\n\nAs a business coach with my own ideas on business growth , it is hard to read a book like this objectively. Inevitably there are plenty of things that broadly match my opinions but there are also things that I don't like or make me feel uneasy.\n\nThe process starts with the vision but here, vision is used to describe strategy rather than a narrow vision a snapshot of the future desired state). This section whizzes through thoughts about strategy and marketing strategy with next to no mention of customers and what they want or competitors and the competitive environment. This is NOT a marketing and sales playbook.\n\nWhat I do like is that it is very much based in backward planning. You (or preferably your management team) decide what you want in the long term. With that in mind, you set increasingly short term objectives. E.g. from 10 years to 3 years to 1 year to the next three months. This makes sure that what you're doing now is consistent with what you want for the future.\n\nI thought the People chapter about getting the right people in the right positions was excellent and I'm definitely bringing these into my best practices.\n\nThe chapter on Numbers (key performance indicators ) is relatively simple. It recommends a top level dashboard to keep on top of the entire business as well as assigning everyone a number. It is also very focused on leading indicators that predict future performance rather than lagging indicators. I have a few concerns about local optimisation causing sub-optimisation for the entire business if people are judged on one personal measure.\n\nThe next chapter is about identifying and solving Issues. It's based on establishing an open and honest culture where problems are acknowledged rather than hidden away or disguised. The emphasis is on solving these problems. The emphasis is on digging down to the root cause rather than solving the surface symptom but the book lacks a process to do so. This can be a complex area.\n\nMany businesses waste a great deal of time with firefighting I. e. making short term fixes to long term problems. This stores up problems and over the months and years wastes much more time and causes a great deal of frustration . I love the way the book emphasises finding proper solutions, even if uncomfortable for some. It requires a commitment to the greater good of the business.\n\nNext is the deep-dive into your processes. This may not feel exciting but it is vital if your business is going to run smoothly while you drive it forward. Well designed and documented processes mean the business can function without your day-to-day supervision and make the business easier to sell for a good price.\n\nThe sixth and final element of the process is called Traction and this brings the longer term objectives down to quarterly improvement goals (called rocks) together with quarterly and weekly meetings. This may sound like a lot of meetings but this is how you get things done. From my own experience, I've always liked weekly meetings to maintain focus and keep the momentum driving forward.\n\nI like the system a lot. I can't say it's groundbreaking but it does bring together best practices (or at least good practices) into a simple system. When I explained it to a client, I said it was like a jigsaw puzzle and you had all the pieces laid out to form the complete picture.\n\nIt doesn't get off to the best start with the Vision/Strategy section. Since everything else is designed to implement these objectives, the book has to start here but, if this is where your biggest issues are, then you need to read another book first. Where this book excels is implementing the developed strategy.\n\nYou implement strategy through your people and organisation structure , through your performance reporting, through your systems and processes and through your management system. This is the true focus of the book and it is excellent.\n\nWho should read this book?\n\nI think it's main benefits will be felt in businesses big enough to have three or more tiers - that the owner(s), some managers or supervisors and staff.\n\nWhen there are just the two levels, you won't have anyone who doesn't have the benefit of direct contact with the owner. At that stage it isn't a problem to maintain consistent focus, direction and values provided the owner is capable. Beyond that things get more complicated.\n\nThis book is very highly recommended. Just adapt the system to to suit your size and business.\n\nPaul Simister is a business coach who helps business owners who are stuck, get unstuck.",
    "The book and system are like a Tarantino film. The content is a rebadging of existing concepts the interesting part is how they're synthesised together. This is Michael Porter's generic focus strategy wedded to Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management.\n\n100% doesnt understand marketing. Confuses marketing with business development - read Koetlers Marketing 4.0 to get a better idea of a modern marketing function.",
    "If you have a business & are looking to take it to the next level, I really recommend Traction. It builds on the lessons from The E-Myth & gives you a blueprint for tracking your KPI & building the Leadership team",
    "This is an excellent book on keeping control of your business as it grows and it helps you put into place a number of quick references to the health of your business at a glance using the weekly scorecard detailed within. Where this book really shines for me personally is in linking up the 10 year vision all the way down to weekly to dos and meetings. For someone like me very visionary by nature it's easy to see the big picture traction helps you connect that big picture to the small one and pick up speed getting there. I have read numerous books on business, organisation as well as paying companies to consult with me on sales marketing business, this book has helped me pull all that together into something I can use to automate my current business so can get working on building the next one! Great stuff thank you for writing such a great book!",
    "A version in English would be a start instead of being packed with Americanisms. I’ve read a few books like this and the Americanisation just makes me think BS. Once you cut through the americanisation some of things are good but they’re only what you’d find in any half decent books on how to run a business, just given different names."

    "(Reviewed by Gwen's 15-year-old son) \"How to Read Literature Like a Professor,\" in many respects, is very much like literature as a whole: broad and encompassing, yet concise and comprehensible. To most people, at least. It is an agreeable, strongly opinionated guide to the things that every reader may be thinking, but is greatly pleased to see written down to reinforce their own opinions. In this respect, it is nothing short of a great piece of analytical literature: it's relevant (and most likely always will be), readable, and refreshing.\n\nMany main ideas expressed throughout Thomas Foster's twenty-seven chapters are powerful, and communicate his ideas clearly. The ideas themselves are agreeable, as I found it hard to argue with his conjecture more than a few times. His statements about both the fruition and purpose of literary symbols and themes are insightful and well-read, and he gives many more examples than necessary to prove his point. The analytical nature of each individual chapter is invaluable for a great understanding of his arguments, while also helping the novice reader to find parallels within other works of literature. I myself experienced a few \"aha moments\" while doing nightly readings, and I cannot help but think of the biblical references or symbolic implications that Foster so aptly drilled into my skull whenever I watch T.V. or pick up a new book. So from the standpoint of the overall goal, Foster achieves it quite decisively.\n\nWhat else HTRLLP does well is to draw thematic evidence from literary sources that span over much of written human history. Homer, Shakespeare, Poe, and J.K. Rowling are all a part of Foster's roster of famous writers, and they all contribute. This is what made reading the book enjoyable to me; knowing what he's referencing is pivotal to understanding.\n\nHowever, I personally feel like there are a large number of disagreeable parts to this book that more than sap the potential in Foster's arguments. As stated earlier, Foster's arguments are well-read, with large, detailed anecdotes about novels with particular relevancy to each chapter. But that is just the issue. This book is a guide for a novice literary analyst and writer, but Foster expects the reader to know obscure novels that would not crop up in an average high school curriculum. Besides a quick detour on Shakespeare, almost every other reference in the entire book is a nod toward some random piece of literature. Granted, these random pieces of literature may be great ones, but it is hard to understand an argument when you have never read Going After Cacciato. And that book is referenced a lot. Although Foster does adequately to abridge the main points, a reader cannot connect on a deeper level with a novel if all they have to work with is the shallow summary of a book, and that is exactly what Foster intends for us, the reader, to do.\n\nAlso, Foster falls short in that he provides his reader with a very narrow concept of literature as a whole. The first chapter was absolutely repugnant, and hearing the phrase \"there's only one story\" drove me insane. Like language itself, literature is ripe with exceptions, and there is no instance where a situation is always or never true; it simply is not that black and white. On that same note, at any instance that Foster adds an infinitive like \"always\" or \"never\" into his bolded phrases, my mind would look for any example to prove him wrong. He himself stated that \"`always' and `never' are not words that have much meaning in literary study\" and his parallels to Jungian theory just beg for opposition. He may be saying it for the sake of clarity, which is necessary to any thesis, but using words as inflexible as \"never\" leads me to believe that Foster is making an opinion out of an unbiased analysis of literature.\n\nChapter two resonated with me because of a single line on Sigmund Freud, \"sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\" This idea, so simple, and yet pragmatic, could very well be applied to the remainder of Foster's novel. In some instances, Foster has some very profound moments, like describing the mechanics of intertextuality and the pervasiveness of Shakespearean quotation. However, he has some low moments as well. The deeper the reader goes into the book, the less comprehensible his ideas become. While the single, bolded line is still there in every chapter, the analysis that follows gets longer, and above all, more singular in viewpoint. It is here where Foster has run the risk of overanalyzing his ideas, to a point where these ideas blur into nothing more than pure personal conjecture. While he promotes the free flow of individual significance to symbol and theme, his own ideas saturate the page so heavily that the reader gets bogged down with thoughts that they are not their own.\n\nAnd finally, the coup de grace is the \"no duh\" moment. For a 281 page guide to literature, you can expect it to cover quite a bit of ideas, archetypes, and popular allusions. But more often than not, this coverage is simply not the analysis one should expect from such an ambitious book. It has very casual, almost simple rhetorical questions like \"Just what do up and down mean?\" and \"`Who ya gonna call?'\" followed by similarly clichéd or skin deep analysis. When you remove all of the personal opinions Foster lets seep into his pages, as well as the content that is pure anecdote or ponderous questioning, you will usually end up with little more than that single bolded phrase that summarizes each chapter. While I praise Foster for his directness, I do not feel the same way about asserting author's intent and conversing as if his readers could not possibly understand cultural reference.\n\nOverall, I feel as if \"How to Read Literature Like a Professor\" is an interesting mix of great accomplishment and crippling error. I learned, but I did not enjoy doing it. I put up with his banter and bad jokes and probably acquired a great tool for experiencing literature. But I cannot say that this book is a triumph or a nasty brown stain on the face of analytical literature. For all of its glaring faults and obvious ideas, what this book achieves will leave a more lasting impression than its pitfalls. Foster's highly mythological analysis of literature and its origins may be out of most people's capacity or patience, but it does have quite a bit to offer. But if I were to phrase all of this, I guess it would have to be as follows: you can't enjoy \"How to Read Literature Like a Professor\" unless you are one.",
    "My daughter loved this book",
    "It's a rare day that I'm willing to give a full five out of five stars to a book. It's rarer still that I'll give the five stars, and then put it back on my bed-stand for continual reference in my future reading.\n\nIt's just that kind of a book, and every bibliophile should read it.\nIn \"How to Read Literature like a Professor,\" Thomas Foster has given us a delightful little romp through literature, producing a guide to the themes, symbolism, ironies, allusions, and plots that reoccur through-out almost all of the fiction we read. Whether it's Charles Dickens or Charles Schulz or even Tom Clancy, Foster's collection of essays are each a fun and enjoyable guide to what you've been reading, and what you will read, when you pick up a work of fiction.\n\nFor example: in chapter 10, \"It's more than just rain or snow,\" we read that \"weather is never just weather. It's never just rain.\" Rather, Foster says, instead of providing just a setting, a backdrop to the story, weather in fiction is rooted in our fears and hopes. In addition to appearing as a feature character in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic biblical tale of the great flood, it makes notable and significant sightings in mythologies from all over the world, often, if not always, appearing and appealing to our fear of drowning. \"Rain,\" Foster says, \"prompts ancestral memories of the most profound sort. So water in great volume speaks to us at a very basic level of being.\n\nSo rain--and floods--signifies drowning? Kind of, but it doesn't stop there. Citing D.H. Lawrence's \"The Virgin and the Gypsy\" (1930), which I've not read yet, Foster sees it as a \"big eraser that destroys but also allows a brand-new start.\"\n\nKind of like baptism? Yeah. If you're part of that Christian tradition, this is what baptism is: death of the old, imperfect, and flawed man, and rebirth of a new man. And such is the role that this element--rain and floods--plays in literature. Well, most of the time. Fog can represent a lack of clarity, sunshine hope and clarity. In short, weather is rarely just setting.\n\nThat's rain and weather. Each chapter is a written with a quick and light wit that allows a reader, whatever his level of experience with literature, to follow along, see the theme, enjoy the examples, and find a taste for the point. Other chapter titles include the following:\n\n* \"When in Doubt, It's from Shakespeare...\"\n* \"...Or the Bible\"\n* \"It's All Political\"\n* \"Marked for Greatness\"\n* \"Nice to Eat with You: Acts of Communion\" and, of course,\n* \"Nice to Eat You: Acts of Vampire.\" (Stephanie Meyer ought to pick that one up to understand why people who love literature hate Twilight).\n\nWeighing in at just under three hundred pages, \"How to Read Literature Like a Professor\" doesn't require deep commitment, deep concentration, or deep literature reading. My brain-candy of choice usually falls in the science-fiction or fantasy categories, and yet, I've started to find the themes and allusions and ironies that I saw in classics like \"Howards End\" and \"Bleak House\" appearing there, too. Whatever you read, it applies the symbolism that Foster walks through. As a result, my experience, whatever I'm reading, has been more enjoyable since I started it. It's that moment of sudden realization when the whole theme of Steven Erikson \"Book of the Fallen\" subplot (and there are a lot of them) is an allusion, or imitation, to Spartacus (I think). Or that the journey (all journeys are quests) across the water is a journey of transformation, where the fallen man chooses to start a new life, emerging from the water, as it were, reborn.\n\nIt's fun. A lot of fun. Even just reading the book itself is fun. To boot, at the end Foster provides a list of all the books he refers to throughout his essays to allow you, the reader, to pick them up and read further. And what could be more fun about reading than delving into great fiction?\n\nPick it up, start reading, and enhance your general reading experience. If you're going to read fiction, and you should, you might as well get the most out of it.",
    "The most enlightening and entertaining book on understanding western literature indeed. In a way, it’s still daunting for someone from outside the Greek/ Christian tradition.",

    "Cut to the Chase:\nA well-written synopsis of 11 “great” companies and some of their similar characteristics, this is a fun, quick read that is great in terms of party trivia and information… but it’s tougher to judge if you’re looking for more of a business how-to. Partially, it has aged poorly — many of the companies selected have since had meltdowns of epic proportions (for example: Fannie Mae, Circuit City), and the “how to” part of the book feels generalized and far more subjective than the methodology/selection criteria would have you believe. Still, you’ll learn quite a few fun facts about how some of these business started and/or converted to become the giants they are today.\n\nGreater Detail:\nThe main premise of this book is that though there are many very successful, long-lasting corporations out there (Coca Cola, GE, etc), there are a handful of companies that transcend just long-lasting durability, and become truly “great” companies. The selection criteria (mostly explained in the appendices) identified 11 “great” companies out of 1,435 analyzed, mostly via things like stock performance (the companies chosen were at about market average for about 15 years, and then jumped to being about seven times better than market over a period of 15 years, hence the title: good to great).\n\nThe idea was to then take a more in-depth look at the 11 companies to see what similarities existed, and to then compile kind of a how-to in terms of what distinguishes the greats. Some of the ideas explored are things like:\n\n1. The Level 5 Leader — Collins proposes the idea of a leadership hierarchy of skills; a Level 5 leader is a dual personality of sorts — someone who is basically modest, but willful and stubborn, almost introverted and shy, but simultaneously fearless (this is kind of the opposite of say the CEO-centric view where Apple was in part defined by Steve Jobs as a leader and a personality, Bill Gates by Microsoft, etc). He argues that the Level 5 leader is someone who does what’s in the best interests of the company — no matter what (preparing for crises before they happen, sacrificing part of their lives often, etc). Counter examples given are leaders who so define the role that they’re unable to appoint successors, or have a successful successor — the argument here is about systematic management, filling the role that the company needs, for the good of the company, and almost without personal ego.\n\n2. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop — Even though the media sometimes portrays changes as though they’re instantaneously effective or immediately impactful, in reality, most companies that are successful slowly build momentum via a flywheel effect, constantly confronting the “brutal” truths and having faith that with discipline and continued effort and momentum, a breakthrough will happen. The Doom Loop is when there is a lack of patience that leads to continued cycles of new leaders, new directions, and new innovations, without ever waiting to see something through.\n\n3. The Hedgehog Concept — This is the concept of doing one thing really, really well. Here the argument is that you don’t have to be the best at everything, that Walgreens became a great company by getting rid of its restaurants (it had over 500 at one point) and focusing on what it was strongest in — being a convenient drug store. It focused on location, location, location (always being on a corner, for example), offering 24-hour pharmacies, flu shots, expanding into poorer neighborhoods, and being an almost pervasively convenient option for its customers. It basically asks companies to think about what they can really be best at and specialize a little, find something they are passionate about that they can truly excel at.\n\nAs I’ve said, it’s an interesting read. and in terms of things to make you think, there’s a lot of good cocktail party fodder — is it better to have an invisible leader who sacrifices everything for their company? Or is there benefit to having a targeted leader to focus on (the Zuckerbergs and Jobses, leaders who are synonymous with a company’s image). But if you’re reading it now, more than a decade after its initial publication, it’s hard to take it as seriously when it talks about Fannie Mae (which has gone through a federal takeover/bailout) or Circuit City (which has filed for bankruptcy) or even Wells Fargo, which has had its share of legal and financial troubles. Also, though it’s a nice retroactive, backwards-looking book about what has helped 11 particular companies, it’s hard to know how much is truly applicable going forward. So in that sense, it’s less of a how to go from good to great, and more of an interesting, almost historical read, about how these particular companies made the jump (and then sometimes plummeted back).\n\nComparisons to Other Books:\nI had a similar experience with Collins’s Built to Last, which was supposed to detail the successful habits of “visionary” companies. It was a fun synopsis of a six-year research project by Stanford, and I learned all sorts of interesting trivia, but, as with many books that are backwards-looking studies of still-in-business companies, it’s sometimes hard to take the overarching messages seriously knowing how some of the chosen companies have performed since publication. I think these are great books if you’re looking to read something interesting about the business world, but I’m not sure I’d really call them instructive per se.",
    "I felt like things did not start to move till around halfway through the 3rd chapter. Before that it seemed to get stuck on the statement, \"will reading this make you great, well we can't promise that...\" several slow parts in this book making it difficult to finish. There were some interesting points such as how the main thing is to have a goal and stick with it and how there was no consistency of specific goals between the \"Great\" companies that matched, such as being kind to others, or \"just in it for the money companies.\" I do agree with having the right people on the bus makes a huge difference. Unfortunately those other people usually stay too long past the (bus stop) time they should be off, and if the bus is full of those individuals you will not have room to hire the right people to help fill the bus. Good luck on your read and possibly get this as an audiobook so you'll finish it faster than I did.",
    "Jim Collins states in his book, \"Good is the enemy of great. And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that become great...We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\" After reading that statement I became very curious and wanting to continue reading to see what are the components that make a good company to be a great company, in hopes of maybe being apply it myself one day I really enjoyed the way in which Collins organized the book. From his five year research study of 28 different companies Good to Great discusses key critical concepts revealed through his studies as to why some companies became successful great companies, while the others continued to be good. Collins found from his research within a great company you will have discipline people, with discipline thought, drives discipline actions. Within each discipline it is broken down into a subset of two components:\nI. Discipline People\na. Level 5 Leadership\nb. First Who... Then What\nII. Discipline Thought\na. Confront the Brutal facts\nb. Hedgehog Concepts\nIII. Discipline Action\na. Culture of Discipline\nb. Technology Accelerators\nI believe by organizing the book in this matter enabled me to really understand the severity of the critical components and how their relationships if applied will in allow a good company to become a great company. Starting with Discipline People, Collins conducted and analyzed his research by introducing the types of leaders you would find in a great company versus those in a just a good company and the characteristics that these great leaders possessed, such as humility and will. They lead with the interest of the company and not for their own selfish reasoning. Next was the First Who ...Then what which discuss getting the right people on board and the wrong people out. Collins states, \"People are not your most important assets. The right people are.\" Collins stresses the importance of first getting the right people in the right places in your company and weeding out the wrong and then figure out where your company wants to go.\nNext is the Discipline Thought, within the subset of discipline thought a company must possess the ability to confront the brutal facts and not live in denial. Being able to do this will allow the company to stay updated and proactive when faced with making decisions. Collins presented a methodology for the companies to be able to face the truth. He says an organization must lead with questions not answers, engage in dialogue and debate, and use the \"red flag mechanism\" where anything that is red flagged is information that cannot be ignored and must be handled immediately. Collins also mentioned under the category of discipline thought is the Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is about a Fox and Hedgehog, where the Fox (good companies) knows a lot about variety of things whereas the Hedgehog (great companies) knew a lot about one thing. Being hedgehog is more beneficial for both the company and the individual because it the clarity drives focus and direction whereas the fox has neither one direction nor focus which can backfire later down the road.\nLastly, having discipline people with discipline thoughts will drive to discipline action which uses the culture of discipline and technology as another tool to help transform the company from good to great. Collins also refers to the Flywheel Concept. He says that a good to great company never happens all at once it take a lot of effort and time to get it going, like the flywheel. The flywheel requires a lot of pushing to get it to turn and after x amount of time it will begin to gain momentum.\nThroughout the book Collins gives great examples for each discipline and its component and how it either went from good to great or continued to be good. Along with the examples Collins provides pleather of diagrams and charts in the appendix, which becomes a great reference for the reader and creates a better understanding of what is needed to go from a good company to a great company. Generally the book is a very easy read which makes it that much more interesting to want to apply to your company or even for yourself. It takes the feeling of the impossible away, like Collin stated, \"We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\" Overall if you are looking to transform your company, Good to Great is a read that I highly recommend.",
    "GOOD",
    "Good to great summarises the findings from extensive research into what makes certain high performing companies outperform their peers. The findings are both interesting and capable of being replicated by any company that wishes to improve performance.\n\nThis book is very concise and full of interesting case studies. It was one of the few occasions when I wished the book could have been a bit longer.\n\nWell researched, well written, well done!\n\nHere are some of the learnings I will be taking away from this book:\n• All Good to great (“GTG”) companies had a Level 5 leader\n• Level 5 leaders consistently exhibit humility, modesty and an ability to reign in their ego.\n• Many companies are drawn towards outgoing egocentric leaders and this is often the wrong choice.\n• Level 5 leaders are more interested in something larger and more lasting than their own career\n• GTG leaders concentrate on hiring the right people before deciding on strategy\n• Don’t compromise when hiring. If you’re not confident then keep looking\n• When someone needs to leave the company act quickly\n• Give your best people the best opportunities and not your biggest problems\n• GTG management teams have rigorous debates and aren’t afraid to share their views. But when a decision is made they act as one\n• GTG companies ensure information flows give management the right facts to manage the business effectively\n• GTG companies foster a culture where employee’s views are heard and acted upon\n• GTG companies review failures without negative consequences for the people involved\n• Figuring out how to motivate people is a waste of time. If you hire the right people they will motivate themselves.\n• Good to great companies did one thing exceptionally well and stuck to it (the hedgehog process)\n• GTG companies developed their strategy from a deep understanding of what they could be world class at. This was not a goal or intention but an understanding of reality\n• GTG companies typically focussed on one KPI e.g. profit per customer\n• GTG companies were incredibly disciplined and did not waste time and money on unrelated activities and acquisitions\n• GTG companies used technology as an accelerator of, not creator of, momentum\n• Careful consideration should be given to whether a given technology fits with your hedgehog concept\n• GTG companies often looked like an overnight success from the outside but in reality they were long in the making and a result of persistent action over a long period of time.\n• Preserve core values and purpose while strategies and practices endlessly adapt with the changing world",
    "I always try and buy books not printed in India, I thought this was printed in USA and when saw pathetic fonts , low quality ink and thinner fonts immediately looked for as to where it was printed and to my horror it was in India , as no other option is available I will make do with this terrible printed in India edition",
    "Such a disappointment sadly. I had high hopes for this book because it's hyped up and a bestseller (for some reason). Couldnt get beyond the first chapter, flicked through and was met with more of the same. Very academic, more like reading a university research paper than a book (don't be fooled). It terms of practical advice to implement - very little to offer. Every paragraph had dates, statistics and peoples names which personally I find really hard to engage with and not easy to read. For academic types, I'm sure it would be interesting but it's more business historic than anything else.",
    "Incredibly valuable and easy to read piece of work!\nA stunningly enlightening study of winners and losers\n\nAs Exec Chairman of a pan-European SME, the easy read of this book has refuelled my determination to (try and) get it right. Unfortunately, bad companies managed by Rambo like individuals remain the norm on this side of the pond... Still very refreshing read about what works and what doesn't...",
    "I read this book with great interest as it's selection criteria for the finally selected 11 companies was strict and the author does not withold any information on the selection process either. The end of the book lists its selection criteria, complete with a comprehensive FAQ section.\n\nThe final selection consists of 11 good to great companies (Selected from 1435 Fortune 500 companies) and 17 comparison companies that could not qualify. The primary selection process consisted of baselining the 'good to great' companies at three times the market for fifteen years including 15 years of good performance (1.25 time the general stock market) preceding the transition while the company had to be an established, on going company, not a startup.\n\nPretty strict criteria that has led to some eye opening findings. Most of the findings can be browsed by reading the reviews on the Amazon .co.uk and .com sites.\n\nA MUST READ BOOK for all aspiring and current leaders."

    "As someone about to retire after 41 years of “striving”, I found Mr. Brooks words very powerful. He empirically defined the physiological changes that my mind and body are experiencing (humbling for sure) while laying out how I can create a 2nd life that allows me to use my accumulated wisdom to find interesting and rewarding work. As a man of faith, using things, loving others and worshipping the Devine resonate. Spending my remaining years learning new things, investing in the people I love or meet anew, and using my time productively for the benefit of mankind feels really appropriate and energizing.",
    "This was one of the best books I have read as an educator of 40+ years. As a teacher, school counselor, supervisor, mentor, I was affirmed in many recent thoughts and realizations I had of myself as I neared the end of a great career. I was affirmed and even relieved to learn that a number of my feelings and experiences were not just being weary but were normal and expected as one ages. I LOVED Brooks' advice for people to find meaningful work and his advice on what companies/employers should be doing to take advantage of seasoned employees by using them as mentors and advisors to younger employers. His approach to embrace seasoned (older) employees and their skills was spot on and needed in each school where I worked. This is a GREAT book and I would love to see Dr. Brooks have regular podcasts on topics of his interest.",
    "I am a retired business owner, age 77, and LOVED this book. I first bought the audible but there was so much I wanted to underline that I bought the book and also sent books to relatives. As I get older the truth of what it says in every chapter is spot on!",
    "Strength to Strength is a great book! Here are the things I liked about it:\n\n-Well written and engaging.\n-Author shares lots of historical examples to back his points.\n-Very helpful for those who have been in their careers for 20+ years, especially on how to finish well.\n-The chapters are organized in such a way that it is easy to stop and pick back up on reading when you pause mid-chapter.",
    "Really enjoyed the book and the authors thoughts on mid-life journeys and what's actually important in life. Very easy to read... I actually wish it was a little more meaty in substance. It felt like abruptly ended.",
    "I’m trying to make some decisions on my retirement and this book really help me put it in the right perspective for me. I really found myself as the “success addict” and I’m taking the steps to fall away from that thinking",
    "I really enjoyed this book. The authors explanation of where we will truly obtain fulfillment in life was eye opening. Maybe its the stage of life i am in, but it is a life changing book",
    "I found this book to be absolutely amazing.\n\nI like to think of this book as a primer, a key to the front door of The ReFirement Zone.\n\nThank you Mr Brooks for the keys.\n\nPeace",
    "If you're a success-addicted workaholic facing the fact that you can't keep going forever, then this book may serve as a handbook to future happiness. If you've already worked out that work isn't the secret to a happy life, it's probably not going to tell you anything you don't already know.",
    "I have given 4 stars because I think the book is very good, and it would be unfair to mark lower. However I purchased this book for our director who is retiring early and it is totally inappropriate for a gift! It's hilariously inappropriate so for that reason I would have scored maybe a 2.\nThe book is really well written, from a social psychologist perspective and I would recommend it because it covers excellent challenging subjects. However this is definitely not suitable for giving as a gift to someone retiring! The contents focus on mental decline, success addiction, death, loneliness, spiritual inspirations etc. which, the way is written, is a bit depressing for someone about to launch into their next stage of life. This is suitable for people at a cross roads needing a self help councilling book with insight. This book offers that. But my director is in a good place, moving onto new exciting things and this would have been a downer. It is an excellent book, beautifully written and very relevent for deep thinkers, good stories. The book ends with 7 key words/3 mentras:\n1. Use things\n2. Love people\n3. Worship the divine.\n\nI would have been mortified if my director had been given this as it implies he needs help!! Lol",
    "A book that encourages us to see, understand and embrace the uniqueness of the latter stages of life. Read it now, it’s probably later than we think …",
    "I had already started on the path shown in the book but it has given me the real meaning of fluid and crystallised intelligence and how to use it in later stages of life. A fun book to read.",
    "Aufmerksam wurde ich auf das Buch durch den Podcast \"A Bit of Optimism\" von Simon Sinek und hatte mir daher tiefe(re) Einsichten in das behandelte Thema gewünscht. Leider werden die Kernaussagen lediglich mit vielen - teilweise aus dem zeitlichen Kontext gerissenen - Anekdoten umschmückt. Aber mehr als eine autobiographisch anmutende \"Anleitung\" ist bei mir nicht hängen geblieben.\n\nAls Gute-Nacht-Lektüre sicher brauchbar, aber insgesamt schwingt mir zu viel Dogmatismus mit. Einverstanden bin ich mit der Auffassung, das eigene Leben zu hinterfragen. Den \"Punkte-Plan\" des Autoren kann ich nur als _seinen_ Weg verstehen und nur wenig auf mein Leben übertragen."

    "One of the Managers of my job gave me this book to read as I’m one of the team leaders involved in changing the culture of our section and focusing it more on appreciation, cooperation and collaboration. This is a really short and simple books that is also pretty cheesy but it does have a good overall message for team leaders, which is basically you have the power to control the mood and direction of your team and it is your responsibility to get the team to where it is going.\n10 RULES FOR THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE\n\n1. You’re the driver of your bus.\n2. Desire, vision, and focus move your bus in the right direction.\n3. Fuel your ride with positive energy.\n4. Invite people on your bus and share your vision for the road ahead.\n5. Don’t waste your energy on those who don’t get on your bus.\n6. Post a sign that says NO ENERGY VAMPIRES ALLOWED on your bus.\n7. Enthusiasm attracts more passengers and energizes them during the ride.\n8. Love your passengers.\n9. Drive with purpose.\n10. Have fun and enjoy the ride.\n\nI think that all of these are good ideas and yes I was totally hit over the head with the same metaphor over and over again in this book but the idea of it was there.\n\nYou are responsible for everything happening with your team on in your life. You have to change your own thinking and actions if you want others to join in, lead by example.\nif you want to change your situation you must first change your thoughts.\n\nShut down the naysayers in your group, this is not the people asking questions and looking for answers but the people who complain and criticize with no specific data to back up their claims.\nYour positive energy and vision must be greater than anyone’s and everyone’s negativity. Your certainty must be greater than everyone’s doubt.\n\nLet your team know where you are headed. If no on knows what the final product/idea/outcome wanted is how are they going to envision a way to get there. Also care about your employees and what they are doing, give compliments and encouragement when needed or deserved. Be invested in their life outside of work as well as inside.\n\nSo again, this has some good ideas in it, told in a pretty cheesy way. I’m never going to print bus tickets for my group and ask them to get on my bus. But I will always tell them what is expected of them attitude wise and redirect when things start to shift from the main focus of collaboration, cooperation and appreciation. On my team we do not point fingers and play the blame game, instead we state the problem, who is impacted and brainstorm ideas on how to improve that policy, process, or situation in a way that will help everyone involved. It seems simple but it is harder than it seems.\n\nIf you are looking for a short, sweet version of positive team building then this might be good for you. I already had a head start on that so this wasn’t as useful as some other things I’ve read but still had some valid ideas that built on what I was already doing.\n\nAudio Note: The narration of this was really well done and a very easy listen. I think it made me like the book even more than if I would have read it on my own.",
    "The core message of this book? Give more energy to a situation, objective or group of people than you take from it. The rest of the book goes through the usual inspirational story arc that all of these american self help titles do. Maybe that's what the point is, to inspire you. If that floats your boat then fine. Some British readers will find this book overlong, wannabe transformative drivel. If self help for you is 'faking it until you make it' this could be the title for you. Personally I found myself asking how the other reviewers here conned me into buying another one of these motivational titles with so little substance to it. If you're in the market for a self help book that is genuinely a person's life's work rather than double spaced conversational fluff squeezed out by an author for his next pay cheque, try 'Designing the Mind - The Principles of Psychitecture'. Now that is a modern masterpiece that many business executive-type readers may find a productive use of time.\n\nA final comment, the protaganist in The Energy Bus is a hyper-stereotyped jolly black female bus driver in the States. It might be ok for some, particularly of a certain generation, but to me it felt anachronous, distasteful and even though he credits this (allegedly) partly real life character with his epiphany, it just feels exploitative frankly.",
    "A story with great meaning and useful advice for any working adult. We all need a bit of 'Joy' in our lives!",
    "Trite. This book just did not meet expectations at all. I anticipated at least one tip of nuance and magic.....regurgitated ideas in a frankly silly story.",
    "One of the best book I ever read, highly recommend for anyone.\nVery easy to read and easy to understand.",
    "Amazing, passed to my daughter and husband. Simple, memorable and inspirational. Not rocket science but fundamental truths that help universally. Thanks jon"

    "This book was not at all what I was expecting, but contains some good advice that many would benefit from. For some background, my wife and I are relatively young and have career jobs. I bought this book for information on making the most of any extra income, learning more about investing strategies, options for generating passive income, and improving my personal finances. I did learn a few things, but not on these topics (maybe a bit on the last point). The book primarily focuses on interesting finds and anecdotes from the authors' years of research on millionaires in America.\n\nThe book is divided into eight chapters:\n1. Meet the Millionaire Next Door\n2. Frugal Frugal Frugal\n3. Time, Energy, and Money\n4. You Aren't What You Drive\n5. Economic Outpatient Care\n6. Affirmative Action, Family Style\n7. Find Your Niche\n8. Jobs: Millionaire vs. Heirs\n\nThe author essentially splits everyone into two categories: Underaccumulators of Wealth (UAWs) and Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs). UAWs have a low net worth relative to income, and the opposite for PAWs and uses these terms throughout the book.\n\nHis primary argument is that PAWs get to be wealthy by living well below their means - these are people who do not look like millionaires, they live in modest neighborhoods, drive domestic sedans, wear a Timex, and usually have a blue-collar job that does not come with an expensive lifestyle associated and as a result can accumulate a sizeable nest egg. On the other hand, UAWs are typically well-educated professionals with high paying and high profile jobs (doctors, attorneys), but due to societal pressures associated with their social standing are forced to squander all their money living in luxury neighborhoods, driving German cars, and sending their kids to private schools. Their expensive lifestyle means that they spend most of their income and as a result have a low net worth, despite outward appearances.\n\nI agree that this is good advice for just about anyone: live below your means and prioritize financial security over social standing. Growing up in a single-income family living in a modest middle class neighborhood, I'm quite used to the live-below-your-means philosophy and I think it gave me at least some sense of good financial discipline. If my parents are any indication, it works great.\n\nWhere the authors really lost my interest is that the rest of the book is chock full of anecdotes and some rather uninformative statistics to drive a few other points home. While some of these are good points and undoubtedly useful, they always seem to come with caveats or don't draw any real conclusion, which I found frustrating. Most of the points could have been made succinctly in about 1/10 the amount of page space the authors dedicate to them. These include:\n\n- Most millionaires in America are self employed business owners, because they run their personal finances like their business finances. However, going into business for yourself is very risky so we don't really recommend that as a viable way to get rich.\n\n- Very few millionaires have ever spent much money on a nice suit, pair of shoes, or luxury watch. They usually live in modest neighborhoods or rural areas where the cost of living and social pressures of consumerism are lower.\n\n- First generation millionaires (often immigrants) tend to be succeeded by children with financial struggles, since the parent's desire to \"give them a better life\" pushes them into careers where they become UAWs, and their upbringing in our consumerist culture impedes their ability to live frugally. But even if it turns them into UAWs, encourage them to go to college and aspire to a while-collar professional job.\n\n- Parents giving money to their children develops and reinforces poor financial habits. This money is almost always immediately spent, and these children generally have no savings since they are looking to their parents as their safety net and counting on an inheritance. Doing things like buying children a house in an upscale neighborhood or sending grandkids to a private school actually makes the children worse off, since they have to spend more to maintain the associated lifestyle.\n\n- The authors spend an inordinate amount of time and space comparing different careers, which I found next to useless since I'm very happy with my chosen career (Engineer) and have no intention of changing. They continually deride pretty much every professional job you can think of, and simultaneously praises how great working for yourself or owning a business is while going on about how difficult and risky it is to actually own a successful business. The author does not recommend changing careers, but again, this is more of a discussion of what their research has shown than any sort of \"how to\" advice.\n\n- Car buyers fall into four categories: whether you buy new or used, and whether you buy from the same place or shop around. The authors devote an entire chapter to this while only coming to the following conclusions: no method of buying a car is the clear winner, but if you own a business you may benefit from your connections with the owners of car dealerships; and most millionaires drive unassuming domestic (and to a lesser extent, Japanese) cars purchased new or lightly used.\n\nA final note - curiously, I found no mention of anything real-estate related, which to me is highly unusual in any sort of book about building wealth. The only investment advice found here is in the final chapter and could be summarized as \"invest in what you know.\" That is, if you work in a certain sector, your knowledge of the industry will help you make good investment decisions. Not sure how I feel about this one. For example: not working in technology doesn't mean blue-chip tech stocks are a bad investment. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nOne last complaint: most of the financial figures are presented in mid-1990s dollars. I found it frustrating to have to mentally convert to today's dollars to get a relative sense. The authors took the time to update the preface in 2010, it would have been nice to see a revision to the figures quoted throughout the book. (For reference, one 1996 dollar is worth about 1.6 dollars in 2017).\n\nIn summary, I was surprised about the amount of praise heaped on this book. I would hardly categorize it as a self-help book, it's more a retrospective on the authors' research and a collection of anecdotes and interesting conclusions about the countless Americans leading unglamorous lives while accumulating appreciable amounts of wealth. It's a quick read and I made it through the whole book on a 5-hour flight with time to spare. I would only recommend this book as an interesting overview of some good financial habits, or as an eye-opener for those with luxurious financial tendencies who struggle to save money despite their income level. However, for those who have already developed some discipline and are looking for detailed strategies and advice on personal finance and building wealth via investments and generating passive income, look elsewhere.",
    "Some of the info and stories in the book are a bit ridiculous, but in general a good source of basic wealth management suggestions.",
    "Important book showing how people actually become millionaires and what they spend their money on.\nProbably fairly shocking to most to learn the truth.",
    "Are some of the illustrations out of date? Yes. Do some of the ideas such as men with long term marriages most likely to be millionaires non PC? Yes. Save instead of spend obvious? Yep. Uncomfortable mirror if you belong to a country club, drive a brand new luxury car, have a Rolex, send your kids to a private prep school and then get derided as a UAW (under accumulator of wealth) repeatedly? Ouch cause the real millionaires quoted make fun of you as all hat no cattle, repeatedly. And not one of those criticisms matter at all because this book is such an eye opener about who becomes wealthy and how. For the most part they don't inherit it, they don't win it, they don't have a secret formula. What they do is avoid living by rich people, live below their means, earn well, and save/invest over a lifetime. The only thing missing is how the millionaires get decent careers or businesses - three things I can help you with. One - every college is a business so they will tell you \"follow your dreams\" not \"4% of our undergrad degrees are biology of which we can only place 30% in biology jobs (what are we to do, fire 70% of the biology department to help undergrads and then tell you the whole truth about our business?)\". Two - never work for someone else unless they are teaching you how to become their competitor or skills that will help you open your own business. Three - the business world is littered with closed cupcake stores so don't do what you love; instead do a SWOT analysis, do your due diligence, identify the barriers to entry (better be some!), know your first two years cash flow, find a ready market, don't be late to said market, get your spouse working because that extra revenue stream will buy you time, calculate your exact burn rate on one income and save two years worth, and if at all possible start your business part time while still working. So you can discount the criticism of this book as most negative reviewers haven't read it in full, don't like the political insinuations, are defensive big spenders, or wanted some secret that would make them rich. Here is a simple trick to start spending less - look at everything you do in 10 year cost. Hulu $6 per month/ $72 per year / $720 per 10 years - for me worth it. Specialty coffee $5 per day / $150 per month /$1800 per year /$18000 - that right $18,000 over 10 years - no way. Just set two simple goals - first get in the top quartile of household income, and second save 20% of pretax income. If you are under 35 and do those two things (oh and read/follow this book) you may retire in comfort and be in control of your life because you won't be scampering from one bill to the next, in perpetual fear that you might lose your job, always and forever on the wheel.",
    "Useful information, easy to read and very telling. I have decided which camp I will be in and knowing this information will help me and my kids and their kids…….",
    "This is a motivational read for those who want to build wealth - a ‘piggy bank’ in excess of your needs. The central message though is a fairly unsurprising one - to build wealth you need to spend less than you earn and invest the difference to grow over the long term. That might elicit the response ‘No kidding Sherlock!’, but the point is that most of us don’t do it even though it’s within reach of most of us to do so. In much the same way to lose weight we just need to consume less calories than we expend - easy eh?!\n\nThe point of the book’s title is that many apparently affluent people (nice house, car, clothes, gadgets) may not have much in their piggy bank because they are driving, wearing and displaying it instead. People who do have a lot of wealth built up do so because they are living a very modest life - ‘the person next door’.\n\nThe only downsides for me were the repetitive facts and figures drawn from their research which pads out a booklet into a book. Pretty soon you might get fed up of the ‘this percent of that, which as a percentage of this, as a ratio of’ and just start skim reading it as you got the point from the first paragraph.\n\nYou also have to wonder ‘what’s the point?’. You can’t take the piggy bank with you when you die, no matter how big you get it. So of course there is a balance - which I don’t think the book strikes - in knowing the basic things you need for a sufficient life and then using your wealth to enrich your own and other’s lives.",
    "Even though the research is based on America's wealthy, it's interesting to see how habits of the wealthy can be replicated wherever you are in the world. Now, being a black man from modest background, I have always been saddened to witness that most of Congolese people who dress expensive and look wealthy are broke as a joke. While the nerd, silly looking white man is the richest guy at the party. I have few other book references to help me identify the traits of a millionaire (i.e. The richest man in town, the richest man in Babylon, Rich dad, poor dad; Live your life not theirs, why your thinking is keeping you poor) but the study conducted in TMND is astounding. I decided to use the title of the book as my What'sApp tagline because I intend to become one.",
    "This book was highly recommended on a financial independence/early retirement blog I follow so decided to give it a read. The core message of the book is excellent and insightful. However it could've been covered off much more concisely. The authors had run extensive surveys ahead of this book and so it seems to me that they felt the need to belabor the point by going over every single aspect of their findings via this book. By the time you're a third of the way through you find yourself not learning anything new and just wanting it to be over already.",
    "What is the best way to become a millionaire? Frugal! Frugal!! Frugal!!! Awesome book overall. The book is very American and about American millionaires. I'm African, wish it had a more global perspective but you learn applicable knowledge, regardless of location. I recommend 100%",
    "The ideas in this book are well-known and simple, the problem is that it takes so long to get to the point. You can read about these ideas on any personal finance blog on the internet in much less time.\n\nI agree with many that criticize this book for its clear survivorship bias; starting a business is not going to be the right thing for everyone. Perhaps focusing on \"successful upper-middle-class\" financially independent types would have been more realistic and helpful to most, but \"The Financially Secure Person Next Door\" wouldn't be as good a title."

    "When you come late to the party, writing the 160th review, you have a certain freedom to write something as much for your own use as for other readers, confident that the review will be at the bottom of the pile.\n\nKahneman's thesis is that the human animal is systematically illogical. Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.\n\nThe first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.\n\nThe first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.\n\nChapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.\n\nChapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down. NB: Kahneman uses the example of multiplying two digit numbers in your head quite frequently. Most readers don't know how to do this. Check out \"The Secrets of Mental Math\" for techniques. Kahneman and myself being slightly older guys, we probably like to do it just to prove we still can. Whistling past the graveyard - we know full well that mental processes slow down after 65.\n\nChapter 4 - the associative machine - discusses the way the brain is wired to automatically associate words with one another and concepts with one another, and a new experience with a recent experience. Think of it as the bananas vomit chapter. Will you think of next time you see a banana?\n\nChapter 5 - cognitive ease. We are lazy. We don't solve the right problem, we solve the easy problem.\n\nChapter 6 - norms, surprises, and causes. A recurrent theme in the book is that although our brains do contain a statistical algorithm, it is not very accurate. It does not understand the normal distribution. We are inclined to expect more regularity than actually exists in the world, and we have poor intuition about the tail ends of the bell curve. We have little intuition at all about non-Gaussian distributions.\n\nChapter 7 - a machine for jumping to conclusions. He introduces a recurrent example. A ball and bat together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? System one, fast thinking, leaps out with an answer which is wrong. It requires slow thinking to come up with the right answer - and the instinct to distrust your intuition.\n\nChapter 8 - how judgments happen. Drawing parallels across domains. If Tom was as smart as he is tall, how smart would he be?\n\nChapter 9 - answering an easier question. Some questions have no easy answer. \"How do you feel about yourself these days?\" Is harder to answer than \"did you have a date last week?\" If the date question is asked first, it primes an answer for the harder question.\n\nSection 2 - heuristics and biases\n\nChapter 10 - the law of small numbers. In the realm of statistics there is a law of large numbers. The larger the sample size, the more accurate the statistical inference from measuring them. Conversely, a small sample size can be quite biased. I was in a study abroad program with 10 women, three of them over six feet. Could I generalize about the women in the University of Maryland student body? Conversely, I was the only male among 11 students and the only one over 60. Could they generalize anything from that? In both cases, not much.\n\nChapter 11 - anchors. A irrelevant notion is a hard thing to get rid of. For instance, the asking price of the house should have nothing to do with its value, but it does greatly influence bids.\n\nChapter 12 - the science of availability. If examples come easily to mind, we are more inclined to believe the statistic. If I know somebody who got mugged last year, and you don't, my assessment of the rate of street crime will probably be too high, and yours perhaps too low. Newspaper headlines distort all of our thinking about the probabilities of things like in and terrorist attacks. Because we read about it, it is available.\n\nChapter 13 - availability, emotion and risk. Continuation.\n\nChapter 14 - Tom W's specialty. This is about the tendency for stereotypes to override statistics. If half the students in the University area education majors, and only a 10th of a percent study mortuary science, the odds are overwhelming that any individual student is an education major. Nonetheless, if you ask about Tom W, a sallow gloomy type of guy, people will ignore the statistics and guess he is in mortuary science.\n\nChapter 15 - less is more. Linda is described as a very intelligent and assertive woman. What are the odds she is a business major? The odds that she is a feminist business major? Despite the mathematical impossibility, most people will think that the odds of the latter are greater than the former.\n\nChapter 16 - causes trump statistics. The most important aspect of this chapter is Bayesian analysis, which is so much second nature to Kahneman that he doesn't even describe it. The example he gives is a useful illustration.\n* 85% of the cabs in the city are green, and 15% are blue.\n* A witness identified the cab involved in a hit and run as blue.\n* The court tested the witness' reliability, and the witness was able to correctly identify the correct color 80% of the time, and failed 20% of the time.\nFirst, to go to the point. Given these numbers, most people will assume that the cab in the accident was blue because of the witness testimony. However, if we change the statement of the problem so that there is a 20% chance that the blue identification of the color was wrong, but 85% of the cabs involved in accidents are green, people will overwhelmingly say that the cab in the accident was a green madman. The problems are mathematically identical but the opinion is different.\nNow the surprise. The correct answer is that there is a 41% chance that the cab involved in the accident was blue. Here's how we figure it out from Bayes theorem.\nIf the cab was blue, a 15% chance, and correctly identified, an 80% chance, the combined probability is .15 * .8 = .12, a 12% chance\nIf the cab was green, an 85% chance, and incorrectly identified, a 20% chance, the combined probability is .85 * .2 = .17, a 17% chance\nSince the cab had to be either blue or green, the total probability of it being identified as blue, whether right or wrong, is .12 + .17 = .29. In other words, this witness could be expected to identify the cab as blue 29% of the time whether she was right or wrong.\nThe chances she was right are .12 out of .29, or 41%. Recommend that you cut and paste this, because Bayes theorem is cited fairly often, and is kind of hard to understand. It may be simple for Kahneman, but it is not for his average reader, I am sure.\n\nChapter 17 - regression to the mean. If I told you I got an SAT score of 750 you could assume that I was smart, or that I was lucky, or some combination. The average is only around 500. The chances are little bit of both, and if I take a test a second time I will get a lower score, not because I am any stupider but because your first observation of me wasn't exactly accurate. This is called regression to the mean. It is not about the things you are measuring, it is about the nature of measurement instruments. Don't mistake luck for talent.\n\nChapter 18 - taming intuitive predictions. The probability of the occurrence of an event which depends on a number of prior events is the cumulative probability of all those prior events. The probability of a smart grade school kid becoming a Rhodes scholar is a cumulative probability of passing a whole series of hurdles: studying hard, excelling in high school, avoiding drink and drugs, parental support and so on. The message in this chapter is that we tend to overestimate our ability to project the future.\n\nPart three - overconfidence\n\nChapter 19 - the illusion of understanding. Kahneman introduces another potent concept, \"what you see is all there is,\" thereinafter WYSIATI. We make judgments on the basis of the knowledge we have, and we are overconfident about the predictive value of that observation. To repeat their example, we see the tremendous success of Google. We discount the many perils which could have totally derailed the company along the way, including the venture capitalist who could have bought it all for one million dollars but thought the price was too steep.\n\nChapter 20 - The illusion of validity. Kahneman once again anticipates a bit more statistical knowledge than his readers are likely to have. The validity of a measure is the degree to which an instrument measures what it purports to measure. You could ask a question such as whether the SAT is a valid measure of intelligence. The answer is, not really, because performance on the SAT depends quite a bit on prior education and previous exposure to standardized tests. You could ask whether the SAT is a valid predictor of performance in college. The answer there is that it is not very good, but nonetheless it is the best available predictor. It is valid enough because there is nothing better. To get back to the point, we are inclined to assume measurements are more valid than they are, in other words, to overestimate our ability to predict based on measurements.\n\nChapter 21 - intuitions versus formulas. The key anecdote here is about a formula for predicting the quality of a French wine vintage. The rule of thumb formula beat the best French wine experts. Likewise, mathematical algorithms for predicting college success are as least as successful, and much cheaper, than long interviews with placement specialists.\n\nChapter 22 - expert intuition, when can we trust it? The short answer to this is, in situations in which prior experience is quite germane to new situations and there is some degree of predictability, and also an environment which provides feedback so that the experts can validate their predictions. He would trust the expert intuition of a firefighter; there is some similarity among fires, and the firemen learns quickly about his mistakes. He would not trust the intuition of a psychiatrist, whose mistakes may not show up for years.\n\nChapter 23 - the outside view. The key notion here is that people within an institution, project, or any endeavor tend to let their inside knowledge blind them to things an outsider might see. We can be sure that most insiders in Enron foresaw nothing but success. An outsider, having seen more cases of off-balance-sheet accounting and the woes it can cause, would have had a different prediction.\n\nChapter 24 - the engine of capitalism. This is a tour of decision-making within the capitalist citadel. It should destroy the notion that there are CEOs who are vastly above average, and also the efficient markets theory. Nope. The guys in charge often don't understand, and more important, they are blind to their own lack of knowledge.\n\nPart four - choices\n\nThis is a series of chapters about how people make decisions involving money and risk. In most of the examples presented there is a financially optimal alternative. Many people will not find that alternative because of the way the problem is cast and because of the exogenous factors. Those factors include:\n\nMarginal utility. Another thousand dollars is much less important to a millionaire than a wage slave.\n\nChapter 26 - Prospect theory: The bias against loss. Losing $1000 causes pain out of proportion to the pleasure of winning $1000.\n\nChapter 27 - The endowment effect. I will not pay as much to acquire something as I would demand if I already owned it and were selling.\n\nChapter 28 - Bad Events. We will take unreasonable risk when all the alternatives are bad. Pouring good money after bad, the sunk cost effect, is an example.\n\nChapter 29 - The fourfold pattern. High risk, low risk, win, lose. Human nature is to make choices which are not mathematically optimal: buying lottery tickets and buying unnecessary insurance.\n\nChapter 30 - rare events. Our minds are not structured to assess the likelihood of rare events. We overestimate the visible ones, such as tsunamis and terrorist attacks, and ignore the ones of which we are unaware.\n\nChapter 31 - Risk policies. This is about systematizing our acceptance of risk and making policies. As a policy, should we buy insurance or not, recognizing that there are instances in which we may override the policy. As a policy, should we accept the supposedly lower risk of buying mutual funds, even given the management fees?\n\nChapter 32 - keeping score. This is about letting the past influence present decisions. The classic example is people who refuse to sell for a loss, whether shares of stock or a house.\n\nChapter 33 - reversals. We can let a little negative impact a large positive. One cockroach in a crate of strawberries.\n\nChapter 34 - Frames and reality. How we state it. 90% survival is more attractive than 10% mortality.\n\nPart V. Two selves: Experience and memory\n\nOur memory may be at odds with our experience at the time. Mountain climbing or marathon running are sheer torture at the time, but the memories are exquisite. We remember episodes such as childbirth by the extreme of pain, not the duration.\n\nLift decision: do we live life for the present experience, or the anticipated memories? Are we hedonists, or Japanese/German tourists photographing everything to better enjoy the memories?",
    "This is an invaluable book that every person who considers him/herself educated should read - even study. Indeed, it is a scandal that mastering the material in this book isn't considered an essential component of a high school education.\n\nThe author was awarded the Nobel in Economics for his work on what he calls decision theory, or the study of the actual workings of the typical human mind in the evaluation of choices, and the book itself presents the findings of many decades of psychological studies that expose the endemic fallacious thinking that we are all prone to, more or less. The lives of all of us could be improved by lessons learned from this book, not just individually, through self-education, but also on the large scale, if the large scale decision makers in this society in and out of government could be educated as well. In fact, it is largely because these large scale decision makers are no better than the rest of us in their ability to think straight and plan well, that society is as screwed up as it is, and that essentially all of its institutions are diseased and corrupt. The lesson there, however, is that decision making needs to be returned to the individual - that the powers that be need to be deprived of their powers to mess up the lives of the rest of us.\n\nDespite the many virtues of this book - it is well-written, engaging, and its academic author reasonably restrained in the tendencies of his tribe to blathering in abstractions - it is a bit disappointing at the very end, when the author proves unable to synthesize all his material into a comprehensive theory of the thinking, and deciding mind - or at least into a set of carefully formulated principles that provide a succinct summary of the principles of human thinking, both typical and ideal.\n\nKahneman uses throughout a construct that implies that we are of two minds: System 1 is the fast-thinking, intuitive, mind, prone to jumping to conclusions; while System 2 is the slow-thinking analytical mind, that is brought into play, if at all, only to critique and validate the conclusions that we have jumped to. System 2, we are told, is lazy, and if often just rubber-stamps the snap judgements of System 1, or if pressed, rationalize them, instead of digging critically as well as constructively into the complex underpinnings of the material and sorting them out as best it can.\n\nInstead of working this construct up into a comprehensive model of mind, K merely uses it as a loose schema for representing the kinds of thinking thought to underlie the results derived from the many psychological experiments that he here reports on. This neglect raises the question at many points as to just how well the experimenters have really understood the thinking that underlies the behavior of their subjects. But this, I am sorry to say, is a weakness of virtually all psychological experimentation, which is still just beginning to come to grips with the complexity and varieties of cognitive style of the human mind.\n\nWhat Kahneman does do, however, is to provide convenient labels for many characteristic types of fallacious thinking, although again, the exact role of System 1 and System 2, and their interaction, is inadequately explicated. Instead, towards the end of the book, another, somehow related, but nominally independent theme is developed: the disturbing divergence between the experiencing self and the remembering self. This is in itself such an interesting and important idea, so pregnant with both psychological and philosophical implications, that it could have used a fuller treatment, and again, there is no coherent integration of this theme with the System1/System2 construct.\n\nThe idea here is that our present experience includes our most salient memories of previous experiences - for example the highlights of past vacations, or out of the ordinary episodes of our lives. Somewhat surprisingly, though, what we remember is a systematic distortion of the actual experience. Our memory collapse the duration of various aspects of our experience and highlights only the peak moment(s) and the final moments, perhaps with a nod toward the initial presentation of the experience. And this systematic distortion of the actual experience in all its fullness, can lead us to make irrational and detrimental choices in deciding whether to repeat the experience in the future. Thus, a bad ending to an otherwise wonderful experience can spoil the whole thing for us in memory, and cause us to avoid similar experiences in the future, even though by simply anticipating and improving the ending we might make the whole experience as wonderful as most of the original was. Likewise, subjects in experiments involving either long durations of pain, or much shorter episodes of pain with a higher peak, were consistently more averse to the latter rather than the former - or they overemphasized the way these presentations ended as a factor in judging them as a whole.\n\nThese are important findings that go the heart of the question of how best to steer our course through life, but here is the only attempt at integration of this remembering vs experiencing self theme, and the System 1/ System 2 theme that I find in the final chapter, Conclusions:\n\n\"The remembering self is a construction of System 2. However, the distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule originate in System 1 and do not necessarily conform to the values of System 2\".\n\nThere is more here, but it merely repeats the earlier analysis of the relevant experiments.\n\nNo evidence is presented as to the respective roles of System 1 and System 2 with respect to the laying down of memory, to its decay, or with respect to a recently discovered phenomenon: memory reconsolidation. Nor is any account taken of what has been learned, much of it in recent decades, about the interactions between short, intermediate, and long term memory, or any of the radically different modalities of episodic (picture strip) and semantic (organized, abstracted) memory. Consequently, Kahneman's vague reference to the \"characteristics of our memory\" is essentially a ducking of the question of what the remembering self is. I think that at best, the finding of the replacement of the original experience by an abstract predicated on peak-end bias is an exaggeration, though there's no question that \"duration neglect\" is in operation, and a good thing too, unless K means by \"duration neglect\" not just the stretches of minimally changing experience (which have little memorial significance anyway, but even the consciousness of how long the edited out parts were (this distinction was never made in Chapter 35, where the theme of the remembering vs. the experiencing self is first taken up).\n\nSpeaking for myself anyway, I have a much fuller memory of my most important experiences than Kahneman seems to indicate. Naturally the highlights are featured, but what I tend to remember are representative moments that I took conscious note of at the time, as though making a psychological photograph. I remember these moments also because I bring them up from time to time when I'm thinking about that experience. For example, I'm thinking now of a long distance race I did in 2014 (a very tough half-marathon, with almost 2000' of climbing). I remember: the beginning section as well as the ending section; each of the rest stations; certain moments of each of the major hill climbs; at least one moment from each of the descents; and a number of other happenings during the almost three hour event. For me in this race, the peak experience occurred right at the end, when I all but collapsed, yet managed to stagger to the finish line. That ending does naturally come first to mind as a representation of the entire event, but it is merely the culmination of a long and memorable experience with many moving parts, and if I want, my remembering self can still conjure up many other moments, as well as a clear sense of the duration of each of the sections of the course.\n\nOver many years most memories fade, and it's certainly reasonable to suppose that in extreme cases, where they are all but forgotten, only a single representative moment might be retained. However, if we can say anything for sure about memory it is this: we remember what we continue to think of and to use, and we do that precisely because this material has continuing importance to us. The recent research in memory reconsolidation tells us that when we do bring up memories only occasionally, we reinforce them, but we also edit and modify them to reflect our current perspectives, and sometimes we conflate them with other seemingly related knowledge that we've accrued. We are thus prone to distort our own original memories over time, in some cases significantly, but we may still retain much more of the original experience that just the peak and the end, and if we do reinterpret our memories in the light of more recent experience, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In any case, the memories that occur in the present may be said to be a joint project of the experiencing as well as the remembering self, which rather erodes the whole Two Selves concept that Kahneman first posited.\n\nI do not mean to criticize the valuable evidential material in the book, and in general I think that Kahneman, and the other researchers and thinkers whom he quotes, have drawn reasonable conclusions from the experiments they report on. But ultimately, the book, as well as the fields both of psychology and brain neurophysiology suffer both in coherence and meaningfulness because they aren't predicated on a more comprehensive theory of mind. It's the old story in science, first formulated by Karl Popper in his 1935 book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery: unless we approach the data with an hypothesis in mind - unless, indeed, we seek out data likely to be relevant to a particular hypothesis, we're not going to make any enduring progress in understanding that data in a comprehensively meaningful way, let alone be able to make falsifiable deductions about elements of the system for which we have at present no data. Popper's quotation from the German philosopher Novalis comes to mind - \"Theories are nets: only he who casts will catch.\"\n\nIn the final, \"Conclusions\", chapter, K caricatures the abstract economists' model of homo econimicus (man as a rational optimizer of his utility), contrasting it with the more sophisticated and experientially grounded model of psychologists such as himself. In keeping with his penchant for framing (or spinning) his presentation favorably to his own perspective, he calls the economists' model \"Econ\", and his own \"Human\". In fact, \"Econ\" was never meant to represent man in all his humanity, and Kahneman's Economics Nobel, recognizing his decision theory contributions to economics, was preceded by many other Nobels to economists who had been expanding the concept of the economic actor into psychological territory for decades. In fact, the essential view of the Austrian economists dating from the 1920s (von Mises, Hayek, and their predecessors) is that economics is in the end wholly dependent on psychology because it is predicated on the unknowable, unquantifiable subjective value preferences of humans, acting individually and in concert. Cautious generalizations can perhaps be made about human psychology in general, but I think that on the whole the Austrians have been a bit wiser in their restraint than Kahneman and his many, and mostly lesser, pop psychology compatriots have proved in their often sensationalist extrapolations from lab experiments.\n\nHere is an example, I think of Kahneman over-reaching. He speaks repeatedly of the laziness of System 2, and its foot dragging reluctance to get involved in the thinking process, but in the real world, snap judgements are good enough for immediate purposes, and the better part of rationality may be to go with one's fast thinking intuitive System 1: indeed, Kahneman acknowledges this himself in passing, both in his beginning and his ending, but this isn't enough to counterbalance the overall argument of his book.\n\nKahneman also, in his final chapter, speculatively extends his findings into the political sphere (his liberal Democratic Party bias has already been made clear by gratuitous and somewhat annoying usage of salient modern politicians in examples), but not to any great effect.\n\nKahneman advocates \"libertarian paternalism\" consisting of government programs that people are enrolled in automatically unless they opt out by checking a box on forms - thus manipulating the presentation frame so as to trick them into signing on to what some government bureaucrat thinks is good for them. Of course, as long as people are allowed to opt out, one can't call the choice here anything but libertarian, though to be consistent with their socialist mores, liberals like Kahneman really ought to object to such practices as being manipulative advertising. This libertarian finds nothing objectionable about the way such a choice might be presented - after all, the average man, if adequately educated and prepared for the real world, should have no trouble seeing through the frames. What is not only paternalistic, but totalitarian in spirit, is the extortion of taxpayer money to finance such government programs in the first place.\n\nSomehow, it fails to occur to Kahneman that most people could be trained to recognize and avoid fallacious thinking during all those years of enforced and mostly wasteful schooling - just as most people can be trained to recognize the Müller-Lyer illusion for what it is. IMO every high school graduate should be required to learn to recognize and avoid the paradigm cases of fallacious thinking presented in Thinking, Fast, and Slow, and this material could profitably be expanded to cover the many rhetorical tricks used by the manipulators and spinmeisters, both public and private, who batten off of our society. With such training in critical thinking, and with the reintroduction of enough honest and rigor to begin high school graduates up to the 12th grade reading and writing proficiencies that were routine in the 1950s, the need for college as life preparation would be altogether obviated, and most young people could avoid wasting their early years in college, piling up debt, and get on with their work and/or their self-education, as they chose.",
    "Why do people buy extended warranties that are bad value for money?\nWhy do we marry people just because they're good in bed?\nWhy do investors snatch small profits from winning investments whilst allowing large losses to build up in bad investments?\nWhy do parents deny their children life saving vaccinations for fear of unproven risks?\nWhy do we think a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush?\n\nOn the whole humans are incredibly good at making bad decisions because they allow emotions and moral values to prevail over good sense and simple mathematical calculation. We make snap decisions based on our intuition (fast thinking) and often believe our intuition is superior to logic (slow thinking). For example, President Trump recently said he preferred to listen to his 'gut' than his advisors.\n\nKahneman examines the reasons why we make bad decisions and indicates ways in which we might make better decisions - even if the better decisions make us feel uncomfortable because they are counterintuitive.\n\nMy only problem with this book is that it is so laborious in places that I almost lost interest. Sometimes Kahneman goes on and on about a proposition that has (at least for me) zero interest. If he asks 'How much would you pay for a bowl of roses valued at $59?' I don't have an answer because I'm simply not interested and I don't want to know how much anyone else would pay, or why they would or wouldn't pay it. Perhaps it's just me, but I found some of the propositions too complex to bother with. But to be fair there were some chapters that had me spellbound - maybe because they touched on areas where I make bad decisions.\n\nOverall, this is an important book but spoiled by too much dense argument and irrelevant illustration. It could have contained all the salient points and been reduced to half the length without any dilution of the message.",
    "Don't go with this product. The size of the letters are so small that, I bet, you can't read a page comfortably. I'm not saying anything about the content of the book. The paper quality of the book especially, the size of letters, is so poor that u will regret buying this book. Now it's ur choice.",
    "I'm about 20% of the way through and I am going to struggle to finish this. It started really good, talking about intuitive decision-making vs deliberate and gave a few examples of how our brains can be tricked, but then it never moves on. The whole book is just examples of how we can be wrong, written in infuriating 'you think this because you are so-and-so' language. The book is aimed squarely at Americans as are the examples and the author's assumptions. One 'trick' was explained based on 'because you sang your ABCs as a child\". No I didnt, so if that's your basis for the explanation then what now? I just read a section about heuristics but with no explanation of what heuristics involves. The average person on the street doesn't use heuristics. Just thinking about this book is annoying me. You won't get wisdom from this book in my opinion, but imagine if someone listed all their life mistakes and gave you it. You could make a note to not make the same ones, but would you really have learned anything? Maybe if you're planning to enter a psychological 'temple of doom' it's useful to know where the traps are.",
    "Certainly the most thought provoking book I've read in a long time, so much so I've written a blog about it's conclusion and the impact on social media. More importantly how people are being manipulated on social media by people using the \"techniques\" outline in this book.\nIt's not an easy book to read so not one for the beach, but push through and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "I bought this book as I am fascinated with the general topic of the thought processes. It has sat on my bookshelf for over two years which shows either I wasn't that interested or something else was putting me off.\nPick up the book and you see there are well over 400 pages using a very small type.\nRecently I've tried to engage with the book a couple of times but, as a reader from a non academic background, I find it impossible as it is dull to read and repeats to many of the details.\nClearly a lot of people think this book is great but maybe they are coming at it from the viewpoint of an academic study.\nI was interested to read that the audio version is much more palatable so I may come back to that at some point in the future."

    "A lot of complaints in the reviews deal with the fact that the author is an economist and not in the medical field. However, it's that very fact that makes this book so amazing. She has done all the leg work when it comes to locating, deciphering, and comparing the research/studies, and she presents the results of her findings in easy-to-read charts. She states the decisions she made for herself, while giving you the same data to make your own informed decisions, without any judgement. She answers the questions that a lot of doctors don't, with specific numbers and data to back it all up. Basically, her readers get to reap the benefits of her curiosity and her inclination to figure out specific numbers/statistics when it comes to a lot of decisions that need to be made throughout pregnancy. Best pregnancy book I've read yet!\n\nUpdating to include a quote directly from the book: “That, of course, is the value of evidence versus blanket rules. Rules assume everyone will make the same choice given the same evidence; showing people the evidence on their own allows them to make the choices that work for them.”",
    "It's a pity this book got caught up in a kerfluffle about alcohol, when that is about 1% of the books actual content (I've put *exactly* what the author says about it at the bottom of the review for all those negative reviewers who couldn't be bothered reading the actual book!).\n\nThis book was hands down the most useful pregnancy book I read, not because it tells you what to do, but because it calmly presents the data on every major decision you'll need to make during pregnancy, and then encourages you to form your *own* opinions based on it, instead of treating you like an idiot who can't be trusted to understand anything other than black-and-white 'rules'. As the author says:\n\n\"I teach my students that making good decisions requires two things. First, the right data. Second, the way to weigh the plusses and minuses of the decision *to you personally*...So naturally, when I did get pregnant I thought this is how pregnancy decision making would work too. Take something like amniocentesis. I thought my doctor would outline the plusses and minuses...She'd give me the data I needed. She'd then sit back, and my husband and I would discuss it and we'd come to a decision that worked for us. This is not what it was like *at all*\".\n\nEvery pregnant woman knows this feeling.\n\nThis book has the missing data that thinking parents need to help them make many of those decisions, including:\n- What *really* happens to your odds of conception after 35?\n- What is the evidence that having a cup of coffee will harm your baby? or 2 cups? 3 cups? Why is there so much conflicting advice on this?\n- Same for alcohol, by trimester\n- What is the likelihood of miscarriage each week? (I found this super reassuring)\n- What is the statistical likelihood of issues arising from eating deli meats, eggs, fish, shellfish, soft cheeses, and sushi? How do you weigh up the omega 3 vs mercury risk for fish?\n- What % of women are still experiencing morning sickness each week? Are your morning sickness symptoms 'worse' than the average woman and how risky are the drugs for it?\n- What should you know before you make a decision to get antenatal testing for downs syndrome? Does amniocentesis really have a 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage? Is CVS more or less risky than amnio? (We ended up having the non-invasive test, while getting our results the doctor told us 'you seem really well informed on this!'. Thanks Emily :-)\n- Is emptying the cat litter box as dangerous as gardening?\n- Exactly how much airplane travel is risky?\n- What are the real risks (and benefits!) of gaining more weight than the recommended amount?\n- Is there anything that will help you correctly guess the gender?\n- What's the evidence on whether Kegels help?\n- How can I understand the data on which drugs are safe during pregnancy?\n- What is your chance of a pre-term birth, week by week? And what % of pre-term babies at each week will survive? (also reassuring)\n- For full term babies, what is the chance of the baby arriving each week, if it didn't come last week? Are there any studies than show symptoms the baby might come soon? Is there anything safe you can do to bring on labor if you are overdue?\n- What are the risks and benefits of induction? Do you really need to be induced for 'low amniotic fluid'?\n- How long does the average labor really take?\n- What, statistically, are the pros and cons of a c-section or an epidural? What about cord-clamping, homebirth, doulas, types of fetal monitoring, episiotomy, and cord blood storage?\n- An example of an evidence-based birth plan is included, but emphasis given to choosing what works for you.\n\nSo, in summary, the data need to make your own important decisions along the way. Recommended read!\n\n--------\nAppendix: *Exactly* what this book says about alcohol during pregnancy:\n\n\"There is no question that very heavy drinking during pregnancy is bad for your baby. Women who report binge drinking during pregnancy are more likely to have children with serious cognitive defects. In one Australian study, women who binged in the second and third trimester were 15 to 20% more likely to have children with language delays than women who didn't drink. This is repeated again and again in other studies. Binge drinking in the first trimester can cause physical deformities and in later trimesters, cognitive problems.\n\nIf you are binge drinking, stop.\n\nHowever, this does not directly imply that light or occasional drinking is a problem. When I looked at the data, I found no credible evidence that low levels of drinking (a standard glass of wine or so a day) have any impact on your baby's cognitive development\"\n\n(The author then goes on to review a number of studies in more detail, including an analysis of whether those studies correctly separated causation from correlation).\n\n------------\nI did not read that as a licence to go drinking while pregnant. In fact, I read it and chose not to drink anyway (I was too morning sick to want anything to do with alcohol!). And I respected the author for giving me the evidence, and not blindly repeating something others had said.\n\nHere's to being treated with respect when you are pregnant, not like an idiot.",
    "2 friends of mine recommended this book to me and I couldn’t be more grateful. It is solidly researched and, in my opinion, much more helpful than the other famous pregnancy book with ‘expecting’ in the title.\n\nMany one star reviewers take umbrage with the author’s conclusions around alcohol. In my opinion, the author does an excellent job presenting data that proves the US ‘zero tolerance’ policy toward very light drinking during pregnancy is out of step with reality.\n\nHowever, even if you disagree with the author’s conclusions on alcohol, there’s a lot of other great info here. When to start taking prenatal vitamins, what fish is beneficial to eat during pregnancy, how much weight you can expect to gain and how you can expect to lose it…all great info rooted in empirical data, not old wives tales.\n\nThank you, Emily Oster for this amazing book!",
    "I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. It is chock full of charts and data. The author questions conventional recommendations and reviews the actual research. Much of it is fascinating, and the writing style is entertaining. I especially appreciated this book as a father-to-be, as it's basically a crash-course on everything related to pregnancy, and I wouldn't get a chance to learn it from doctors unlike my wife who has regular visits with her OBGYN. I wish more books were like this.",
    "Mascarades as unbiased information when it is actually the extremely strong opinions of one woman backed up with mostly unreliable data. I grew increasingly frustrated with the book and ended up not finishing it when she discredited one study for being too small (118 women) as it disagreed with what she wanted to think and a few pages later used a study of only 58 women to back up her point. I think this book actually could be extremely damaging. The idea is great; the execution is appalling. The author wanted to carry on drinking and carry on eating certain foods so she sought information to support her hypothesis. She also completely dismisses c-sections, saying there is only one reason to have one and that is the baby is breach. This is categorically untrue.\nPLEASE be careful reading this. It is not scientific. The author has no medical standing and I am astounded it ever got published.",
    "After a recent miscarriage, I’m now pregnant again which I am finding to be a very anxious time. I bought this book looking for some reassurance - that I did not get! See the image attached - based on one academic paper from 1989! I don’t think the author realises the impact this sort of statement can have on someone who has been through miscarriage and is already fearing the worst for any future pregnancies. Very disappointed and to be honest disgusted that this is sold as a book to reassure but did the absolute opposite for me. I haven’t found any other evidence to back this statement.",
    "I was hoping to find a good alternative to pro natural childbirth pregnancy books but was disappointed in the end. It is non-judgemental hence the 3 stars but for example I didn't like that the book seemed to treat both the US and UK maternity systems. They are too different in my opinion to be able to make useful comparisons, particularly about home birth. The UK has a well integrated public community midwifery system and also the distance to the hospital is bound to be much much shorter than in many places in the US.\nAnother thing that bothered me was the section on the evidence around epidural analgesia. Yes, the Cochrane review says that epidural analgesia increases the risk of instrumental delivery but it also very clearly says that since 2005, with low infusion concentration, that link doesn't seem as strong. I also think there is a chicken and egg situation whereby if your baby is malpositioned (back to back for eg) or very big or have a protracted labour (often the case with a back to back baby), you're likely to need better pain relief than in more straightforward scenarios which means that it may well not be the epidural that is the reason for an instrumental delivery but the conditions you find yourself in in the first place.\nFinally, I also disagreed with Oster's view that caesarean section shouldn't be a first choice. If you're having one child only, it is the safest mode of delivery at full term. Risks between attempt at vaginal delivery and planned caesarean section are of a different type but in developed countries like the US and the UK, there isn't much difference in terms of outcomes.\nOverall, this book is a bit better than much of what else is out there but I still thought it wasn't as neutral or well researched as I would have liked.",
    "Other than now knowing a glass of wine wont kill me, nothing else was particularly useful.\n\nThe things mentioned from a medial perspective aren't a secret or (like she eludes to in the book) are beyond the outdated medical profession. The NHS appear to be well aware of majority of what she references but with things like drinking, why would they say anything other than stay abstinent? Things about epidurals making labour longer and inductions making labour more painful aren't new pieces of information for most.\n\nIf you want some figures to support what is already out there without the leg work or just want another book for that little bit more information, go for it.",
    "I didn't really like this book. It said many times that lack of nausea lead to increased risk of miscarriage in 30%of women, which made me worry more because I didn't really suffer with nausea. I wasn't worried before and bought the book to try to understand more regarding common pregnancy risks such as caffeine intake etc. but it ended up having the opposite effect for me"

    "First, let me start off by saying that I've read a lot of different books on personal finance. So I'm very familiar with Dave Ramsey's method of personal finances and a bunch of others. I've read tons of articles, blog posts, etc... on paying off debt and investing, etc...\n\nSo this topic isn't new to me.\n\nSo when I got this book (I got an advanced copy of it)I was figuring that I would read this book and probably wouldn't learn anything new.\n\nI was thinking \"ohhhkaaay...so it's gonna probably talk about how to get out of debt by reducing your spending to almost nothing, eat beans, rice and ramen noodles...cut coupons..and do this for several years then you'll be able to start living your life\"\n\nI figured it would be the same old information that I've read in all the other personal finance books....yaaawn!\n\nBoy oh boy...was I ever wrong\n\nI honestly have to say, that this book was the complete opposite of everything I've ever read.\n\nFor you parents, it's like having two kids.\n\nYou know..your first child is usually calm, relaxed, quiet, well mannered and well behaved.\nThen you have child #2...expecting things to be pretty much the same...only to find out your second child is the complete opposite\nChild #2 is a wild child. Crazy, loud, eats dirt...touches the bathroom handles in public washrooms and then the next minute has their fingers in their mouth\n\nWell, Ramit's book is like your second child.\nLMAO.\n\nIt's fun and actually really interesting to read! ( I know...I know..who says that about a dry topic like paying off debt, investing and saving?).\nIt'll make you laugh in some parts(fo real!).\nAnd...it gets you motivated and makes you want to start taking action as soon as you've finished the chapter\nHe gives you action steps at the end of each chapter that you can start implementing right away!\n\nAnd...it's real! He keeps it sooo real that he even talks about his discussion with his wife when bringing up the topic of having a PRENUP!! (ohhhh snaaaapp!! ...bring out the popcorn cuz it's about to go down!!)\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nOk...so here's what I really liked about this book and thought was friggin awesome!\n\n[1. Conscious Spending]\n\nOk...so we've all heard about \"having a budget\". And when we hear that..we automatically think \"cut back on everything. Use water instead of milk in your cereal. Grow your own coffee beans at home in your backyard and make your own coffee to save a couple of dollars a day\"...right?\n\nBut Ramit goes about this in a TOTALLY different way. And I love his approach to it. It's such a small shift in your mindset, but it has a HUGE impact!!\n\nSo basically, he's telling you this. Instead of thinking of your budget as a way to cut back and not enjoy life..think of it like a plan.\nIt's your plan where you are CONSCIOUSLY choosing how to SPEND your money each month.\n\nBut not only that... this is YOUR life! And to live a \"rich\" and \"happy\" life - you get to choose to spend on the things that make you happy.\nSo why not cut back on the things you hate - so that you can spend on the things you love!\n\nAs he says in Chapter 4 on Conscious Spending \"conscious spending isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. It is, quite simply, about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on—and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.\"\n(BOOOM!! MIC DROP!!)\n\n[2. Scripts to use to save you money]\n\nYou ever get nervous when calling up a financial company (like your credit cards) and then you don't know what to say.\nMaybe you don't know how to negotiate, or you just get nervous and forget what to say.\n\nWell...not to worry.\nRamit gives you WORD FOR WORD scripts that you can use to waive annual fees on your credit cards, and even get fees waived on your bank accounts!\n\nI know...when I read that I was like \"hoollld up..wutcha talkin bout Willis!\"\n\nI told you that this book was the complete opposite of other personal finance books. What other personal finance book is giving you exact scripts to use on how to call up your credit card and get annual fees waived?!\n\nIt's these small details that the average person wants to know cuz let's be real...who likes paying fees? Right?!\n\n[3. Open and Honest]\n\nWhat I really liked...which I've never seen before....was the willingness to be open and direct with the reader.\nRamit laid all the cards on the table and he mentions\na. the exact credit cards he uses\nb. the exact bank accounts he uses\nc. the exact online brokerage account he uses\nd. the investments he puts his money in\n\nWho else does that?\n\nBut not only that....like I said, he GOES THERE and talks about the very very very touchy and sensitive topic of having a prenup.\nIn Chapter 9 LOVE & MONEY - he talks about how he had this difficult conversation with his wife. He also talks about why he decided to do it and should you sign one or not?\n\nAlso in this chapter, he covers difficult topics around money like\na. How to help parents who are in debt\nb. Should you tell your parents and friends how much money you have\nc. Talking Money with your significant other\nd. How to handle money when your spouse makes more than you\ne. How to handle planning for a wedding\nf. Negotiating your salary at work\nand more and more...\n\nI'm telling you...Chapter 9 is where it all goes down!\nJust keepin it real with ya...this is the stuff that we REALLY want to know about. This is the real life stuff we deal with on a day to day basis that NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT!!\n\nI mean, sure...we want to know how to pay off debt, invest, etc... But let's be real. That part is boring.\n\nThat's like reading the first few chapters of a hot & steamy novel..like 50 shades of gray. It's necessary to build the story, but the REAL juicy stuff happens later on.... and that's the part you want to get to.\n\nWe've all had a difficult convo with someone about money (spouse, fiance, boyfriend/girlfriend, etc..)\nDon't you wish you knew how to handle it better...well now you will! Now you'll have a plan\n\n[4. He's very specific]\n\nFor example, in Chapter 7 he talks about investing. And he recommends setting up your asset allocation using David Swensen's recommendation. Swensen manages Yale's endowment for more than 30 years and has an amazing 13.5% annualized return.\nHe even gives you the exact percentage's to use\n\n30 percent—Domestic equities\n15 percent—Developed-world international equities\n5 percent—Emerging-market equities\n20 percent—Real estate investment trusts\n15 percent—Government bonds\n15 percent—Treasury inflation-protected securities\n\nI like this because it takes the guess work out of it for you\nJust do exactly what he's laid out - and boom! You've got a successful investing plan in place.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nWHAT'S DIFFERENT\n\nHere are some things that I found different with this book vs other personal finance books\n\n[1. Focus on Big wins, not small wins]\nSo for example, instead of chasing small percentages by getting introductory rates for high interest savings accounts, focus on your asset allocation and what you're invested in. Your time is much better spent focusing on that, and it will have much bigger returns in the long run\nRamit continues to remind us that it is better to use your time working on things that will have a big impact on your life (i.e. setting up your automated investing) vs spending hours or days looking for the perfect credit card.\n\n[2. Word for Word Scripts]\nAs I mentioned, he gives you exact scripts you can use to save money and get fees waived\n\n[3. Automating your finances]\nLet's be real..who REALLY enjoys paying bills? Who really enjoys reading over investment statements and managing their money? No one!..that's who! Not even Ramit (he even admits this in the book)\n\nPlus - we're all lazy. We don't really want to set aside time to look at our investments. We say we will...but let's be honest..most of us don't.\n\nSo in Chapter 5 - he shows you how to automate your finances so that you can get on with your life. He shows you how to setup a system so that your bills get paid automatically and your investment accounts get funded automatically.\n\nAnd when it's all setup and done...you basically only have to spend 1hr a month looking over your finances, so that you can get on with the more important things in your life\n\n[4. Conversations around money]\n\nHe talks about things that others don't talk about...like the judgement you get from friends and family when you spend money on certain things you like...or how we may judge others on things they spend..but we don't know the full context.\n\nOr I'm sure we've all had that one friend who says to you \"why do you still have that old iphone? Don't you think it's time to upgrade?\"\n\nThis was very eye-opening to me and it was great to see someone finally be honest and talk about these things. I have never read a personal finance book that talks about these real life situations this way before\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWHAT IS MISSING\n\nHere are some things I found that were missing from the book\n\n[1. Real Estate Investments]\n\nI'm actually kind of surprised that he didn't talk about investing in real estate (residential or commercial)\nThis is such a hot topic, and there are TONS of Real estate related TV shows now about flipping homes, or agents finding these multi-million dollar homes for their clients.\n\nI think it's a topic that many people are also interested in.\n\nAlso, just based on regular \"street knowledge\"...the average person probably has an easier time understanding real estate and owning property vs understanding how the stock market and index funds work.\n\nThey probably feel more comfortable with real estate because it's a physical asset, whereas the stock market may feel like black magic to a lot of people.\n\nHe talks about Cryptocurrency, so I thought for sure he'd talk about investing in real estate.\nBut he didn't\n\nI wish he had touched on Real Estate as an investment and mention at least what percentage of your portfolio should be allocated towards real estate and how to go about investing in it in a strategic, methodical manner. Kind of like how he explained how to invest in the stock market\n\n[2. Saving up and paying cash for your car]\n\nI found it odd that he didn't talk about the option of saving up and paying for a car in cash.\nHe does talk about how to buy a car, but it involves getting a loan.\nWhich - I found ironic because Ramit is completely against debt.\nSo it didn't make sense to me why he is telling us to get a loan for a car\n\nHe mentions how to save up for other big ticket items (like your wedding, etc..) but he doesn't give you a plan on how to save up for your car and use cash so that you can avoid getting into debt and getting a car loan.\n\nI'm not sure what the reason is behind this...but this was very surprising to me.\n\n[3. Investing in blue-chip stable companies]\n\nRamit is against picking and investing in individual stocks. He recommends investing in Index Funds instead. And for the average person, I understand why\nAnd..he explains why in the book (Chapter 7)\n\nBut - at the same time, I think there could have been an opportunity to mention in the book how to invest in well known, stable, big name companies that have been around for many decades that produce dividends and can be a good addition to your portfolio\n\nI'm not saying that they should make up the majority of your portfolio, but perhaps a small percentage.\n\nRamit is very methodical - and I believe he could have given some sound advice on some criteria to look at for blue-chip companies that have been around forever, and would be solid investments.\n\nOne company that comes to mind that Warren Buffett publicly admits he likes is Coca-Cola. It's not an exciting company but it has a history of being stable and producing dividends for the investor.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nMAIN TAKEAWAY FROM THE BOOK\n\nThe main theme of this book is all about living your Rich Life\nAnd of course, living a Rich Life will mean different things for different people.\nFor one person, that might mean always upgrading their seats on a flight to the seats with extra leg room...for another, that might mean always buying the VIP section tickets at concerts but also that person could care less about eating out at lunch so they always pack their lunch.\n\nIn Chapter 9 (A Rich Life) ...Ramit says :\n\n\"it’s about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on the things that interest me.\"\n\nthis pretty much sums it all up right here.\n\nI realized that life is more about enjoying your money, and using it to do the things that bring you joy and make you happy. Whatever those things are for you. You will have to decide.\n\nI already had a mindset of doing the things I enjoy...but this book helped me to get more clarity on exactly how to do that on a daily basis.\n\nThis book helped me to have a plan to set aside a specific amount each month towards things I love. And more importantly, how to NOT feel GUILTY about spending on things I enjoy (like upgrading my seats on flights or buying courtside basketball seats) because I am cutting back on things I don't like as much (like paying a cable bill)\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWHO SHOULD GET THIS BOOK\n\nThis book is for the person who\n1. hates manually paying their bills each month\n2. wants to have simple and easy investments that they actually understand\n3. wants to not feel guilty about spending on things they love\n4. wants an easy to understand plan on how to pay off debts and still enjoy life (without eating ramen noodles and cutting coupons)\n5. wants tips for having real life awkward conversations with friends and family about money\n6. wants to enjoy their money and know that in the background their money is growing and they will have enough to retire\n7. is tired of the regular boring personal advice that they've read for years and years\n\nRamit's approach is like that one friend who tells you how it is. They call you out on your B.S. and you appreciate them for it cuz they always keep it real with you and you know that they want nothing but the best for ya.\n\nIf you like that quality in people, then you will most definitely enjoy this book!\n\nalso...just being honest...I would've given it 4.5 stars, but there was no way to do so. I think 5 stars is for absolute perfection\nAnd since Ramit left out the topic of Real Estate Investing, he didn't discuss the option of saving up and paying cash for a car and I think he could've touched on investing in blue chip stable companies - I would say it's 4.5 stars (in my opinion)\n\nIt's still an awesome book and by far the best most COMPLETE book I've read on personal finances because it handles those real life topics around money that happen to all of us, but no one else is talking about.",
    "His style is no BS, clear and simple. He explains why he recommends doing things and what the result are. I'm over 50 and have been focused on increasing my wealth over time and honestly, most books are such a slog to get through that I have never finished one. This one I ready in days and took notes on! Then I reread it and took action the parts I hadn't already done. A lot of it is common sense but that isn't something we are all exposed to when we're ready to take action on it. Some of it is really ingenious. Like automating your accounts to pay your bills. Doesn't work for everything but it does for most. If you only pick up a few tips from the book, it'll save you the cost of the book over time. Guaranteed. And there is a lot in there about how people who did as he suggested are in a better place and yes, that does get old, but if you've never heard any of this before, it can be lifechanging. So read it and do as many of the things suggested as you feel comfortable with now. Then read it again later once you've had them in practice and if they've helped, then do a few more. It's your life in the end. You need to live it the way it works best for you. Because in the end we all want to live interesting fun happy lives. The next step is up to you.",
    "Ramit's perspective provides a realistic approach to personal finance. After reading many personal finance books, this one seemed to have the most balanced and realistic approach. The book connects with you in a way that isn't shaming you if you are behind on things, such as debt, and isn't overly praising if you have all of your ducks in a row. The book should help anyone from someone who is making minimum wage and dealing with debt, through high 6 or 7 figure income earners looking to learn more on the psychology of money and personal finance. Highly recommend listening to Ramit's podcast too.",
    "I will teach to you to be rich…. The A-Z guide for those of us who don’t have a clue of where to start! Chances are, if you’re reading this, you’re a lot like me.\n\nIntrigue by the notion of being “rich,” but pretty sure it’s a quick rich scheme of some sort. Like that old friend from high school who suddenly friends you on Facebook, then one day tricks you into going out for a coffee date to catch up on life… only to pop open a laptop and try to set you up to be a consultant for a natural beauty company that is not \"a pyramid scheme.” Yeah, I hate those too.\n\nBut here’s what I do know from stalking *ahem* following Ramit, and soaking up all the goodness through his emails: THIS guy knows his stuff. No fluff.\n\nHe provides you actionable steps and tells you EXACTLY what to do. He’s done the research, and with each chapter, I simply did exactly what he tells me to do.\n\nHe drops names, and tells you which banks to get away from— and which ones he personally uses and trusts. That’s the thing about Ramit, he’s of the straight and narrow, and tells you how he sees it. All his recommendations are based off his own personal experience, and when you haven’t a clue of where to start— like there’s such a thing as a high-interest savings account (whaaa?!), and there’s an alternative for those of us who don’t have a 401K with employer match?!\n\nYes, he goes over the “technical” aspects of money… providing you a step-by-step framework on how to get your finances in order, and how to automate it so you don’t have to keep thinking about it or neglecting it (which you may be doing right now, if you’re still reading this review).\n\nHe simplifies it, breaks it down for you Ramit-style, so just follow the system. This 6-week program, which yes, you can probably take it slower if you like, works. Just DON’T deviate from the system.\n\nI’ll challenge you to stick with it. Give yourself a deadline, and stick with the deadline.\n\nWhy? Because if you don’t set deadlines for yourself, you’re going to procrastinate… and the next thing you know, it’s been a whole year, and you haven’t read past the first chapter.\n\nSo, just trust me on this okay? The moment you get to the section on compound interest, you’ll have your Oprah Winfrey aha moment complete with the brand new car (close enough) that has you sending me virtual high fives for telling you to JUST START today!\n\nBut seriously, if you don’t give yourself a deadline, you’ll never open the accounts he tells you, and then you’ll get frustrated, and instead of trusting the system, you’re going to deviate, get mad, and write a mean reply on my comment calling me a liar, because it didn’t work for you.\n\nOf course, it didn’t work for you! You didn’t do the work.\n\nSo, read the book and do the work.\n\nDo you know why the KonMori method works? It works because those who were serious about getting their house in order had a deadline for removing the clutter from their house. They got serious about getting their home in order in the next 30 days, and keeping only the items that truly \"spark joy.”\n\nAnd that’s how you begin to build momentum, but without a deadline you can easily lose momentum.\n\nSimilarly, Ramit takes you step-by-step, telling you EXACTLY how to set up specific accounts (sorry guys— not going to give the whole book away!), teaches you how to automate, understand your money dials, what you truly value, and how to get you from broke to implementing strategies to help you live a rich life that is in alignment with what you truly value.\n\nThis book challenged me in many ways, forcing me to take a closer look at my finances, I opened up new accounts for the first time, started learning about investments, and having difficult money conversations with my husband (no spoilers here— but Ramit provides you scripts to help you work through these difficult conversations with your partner to getting those overdraft charges removed from your account to negotiating a lower interest rate on your credit cards. You’re welcome.)\n\nWhat does my rich life look like? Going on road trips with my family of five. I’ve designated one sub-savings account for vacations, set up to be automatically funded, and we’re going to take a trip nine months out of the year.\n\nYou may be thinking it’s not possible, or your circumstances doesn’t allow you the time to get through the program. Here’s what I know about you. You’ve read this far. You’re curious. It’s a small investment for your future, your family’s future.\n\nAnd as a mom of three, two with special needs, someone who works part-time for a non-profit, while running an on-line business part-time, I get it.\n\nYou have the time you make. You can do this. I’ve committed to getting our finances in order for myself, and for my family. I know you can do it too.\n\nThe minute your book arrives, write a date on your calendar…. 6 weeks from today, and work through the book. It’s not magic, but it’s a system that works if you’re willing to do the work. You got this!",
    "Until I got this one.\n\nRamit hits it spot on. This is a down to earth ; no BS kinda book, no big fancy terms, no crazy plans or budgeting ... Just basic finance tips that will put your financial life on autopilot mode and quick, simple solutions for retirement and living a \"Rich Life\" that will work for 90% of people (and is likely already 10x better than whatever you're doing right now). Sounds too good to be true? Read the book, you'll see.\n\nI already shared this book with a few friends and colleagues and will be forcing my younger sisters to read this so that they can start planning their Rich Life asap while still in their 20s. I wish someone had given me this book 10 years ago but as they say ; the best time to start saving was yesterday, the 2nd best time is NOW.\n\nFor Canadians ; you can safely replace \"401(k)\" references with RRSP (RÉER) and \"Roth IRA\" references with TFSA (CÉLI) in the book and although the accounts are not EXACTLY the same as their American counterpart, big picture wise they serve the same purpose. As for the banks proposed in the books, you can easily find equivalents with a bit of Google searching (try searching for \"high interest savings account Canada\" for instance).",
    "Read this if you are from India:\nHonest reviews\nI brought this on 24th May and completed this on 26th May.\nBook is really good about finance.\nBut the information on this book doesn’t work if you are Indian.\nThis book is totally written with the view point of USA citizen. Better don’t waste your money if you are from India and Indian. The method used in this book doesn’t work for Indian :( quite disappointed",
    "After reading the first edition just over 12 months ago, I placed my faith in the process and followed Ramit’s actionable 6 week plan.\n\nFast forward one year and not only has Ramit’s advice made and saved me more than I could possibly imagine, he also offered to guide me and a group of select others through the 2nd edition of IWT.\n\nRamit looked at my exact numbers, said everything was looking good, and then showed me how and where they could be improved. Specifically Ramit suggested I increased the amount I invest in index funds and letting them compound, as that was the most beneficial piece of advice for my particular scenario (under 25 and able to use time to my advantage). This one simple change is set to make me an extra £162,000 by adding an extra £50 a month into what I currently invest... and that is only going to continue to increase.\n\nFurthermore, Ramit showed the group how financial issues are caused through psychology and emotion rather than being to do with simple mathematics. The power of not waiting for permission and understanding how and why we make our financial decisions (or do not make them) was revolutionary and something that I have not seen discussed in other financial books. In Ramit’s words ‘This is a psychology book wrapped to look about finance’ and he is correct. If you know that you have let certain financial decisions get away from you, Ramit will help you get back on track with specific steps and zero judgement.\n\nEvery single person who was in the group was ecstatic with the progress they made in the 4 weeks that we had together and it was very much worth staying up until 3am every Monday in return for a lifetime of financial literacy.\n\nThank you Ramit, anyone would be a fool to not buy this book.",
    "In this book you're going to get a lot of good information but , many of them have no use for me (coming from EU/GE) most of them is speaking about credits and 401k account ...",
    "10% interesting recap of information you more than likely have read elsewhere. 90% 'later on I will teach you the secrets but first...' guff.\n\nJust another self help entry into the pyramid scheme of 'you too can get rich' from an author who has only got rich from teaching you how to get rich.\n\nP.S those on six figures will be pleased to know they can sign up for Ramit's advanced course. Just make sure you've signed the blank cheque first."

    "It's funny - despite my general openness about personal matters, this is probably the subject I am least comfortable talking about. When someone is a genius, you go through the first 20 years of your life constantly trying to hide it so as not to be seen as a pointdexter, sycophant or snob. \"Oh, it must be so HARD to memorize a complicated song in one day or ace all your tests without studying, tell me more about the problems in your life\" you imagine 'friends' sneering behind your back, rolling their eyes. The effortless ease with which highly gifted people take on tasks is actually a highly calculated veneer over the same frustrating obstacles as others without seeming arrogant while doing so. The enormous expectation to not just do one's best but to constantly dominate your previous record and everyone else's leads to the eventual sinking realization that there simply is not room in this world for more than one \"the best\". As both popular science and psychology are starting to confirm, being a genius is in no way a predictor of life success despite every individual's good fortune and efforts, and Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers' is the best and most accessible explanation I've read as to why.\n\nImpressing people without even meaning to is one of the earliest memories I have in life. After devouring all of the chapter and picture books I could get my hands on at pre-school age, my parent's classics and old science textbooks (or at least the ones I could reach off the bottom shelf) seemed the next natural step. Dad frequently retells a story in which he asks me as a toddler how I got to be so smart; I replied \"good genes\". Public school has no idea what to do with a kid who signs up for kindergarten being already able to read novels, play piano sheet music and execute batch files in DOS. I was tested at age 7 with an IQ of 163 upon entering the second grade, having already been skipped a grade ahead as well as being a year younger still due to having a September birthday. This conflict between being significantly younger than my peers at a critical age of development and also several standard deviations more intelligent than them was to be a continual source of strife. I begged and pleaded with my parents not to hold me back, not understanding the implications of being so much less emotionally mature than my peers. On the first day of class I got sent to the principal's office for taking my shoes off and refusing to put them back on. At 9, the teachers were fed up with me reading or drawing and 'distracting others' in class but also couldn't fail me when I was getting perfect grades, so I was pulled out and sent to a private school for the gifted, where after a year of constant boredom (diagnosed and medicated as ADHD) and other behavioral problems my teachers treated me as a class scapegoat and suggest that I be better off homeschooled or back in public school. These events marked the beginning of a long scholastic career of underachievement, contempt of authority, and befuddled administrators who weren't sure whether I belonged in the gifted program or Special Ed.\n\nI was lucky enough to be born into a white, middle class family in one of the most highly educated and prosperous parts of the United States. My parents were psychology majors who read all the right books and took all the proper steps in terms of nurturing the development of a gifted child without stifling or overloading me. So why am I not in the same percentile of overall life success as I am in test score range? Gladwell goes into the many statistical reasons why the high-IQ child is no more likely to become successful than any other child when demographic influences are controlled for, some factors as completely out of our control as being born in the wrong month of the year. He also gets down to what I believe is the true difference between successful and unsuccessful people, the willingness to work hard. If I had been self-disciplined enough to put in the hours academically to master unfavorable subjects with the same voracity with which I took to computers, art, music and reading, plus a less cynical attitude towards the school system, I might have gotten a full ride scholarship to any of the best universities in the world. As it is, I'll have to settle for a community college degree acquired at age 19, being published and owning my own business by 21, and knowing that if I do desire to learn a new skill at any point in life, the only thing standing in my way is myself. (Though, as a side note, I definitely pick up new skills a lot slower than I used to as a child and find myself stymied more often, indications that my IQ has dropped either from aging or drug/alcohol use, something that I try to compensate for with extra patience).\n\nThough it will always be embarrassing and awkward, I've gotten used to the incredulous stares and people asking \"how did you do that\", though I never had a particularly good answer. \"Lots of practice, the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time, and luck\" is the old standby, though it sometimes felt insincere. Now, thanks to 'Outliers', I realize that's not an overly humble explanation of genius. If I ever have kids, I will not subject them to a barrage of tests in order to find out exactly how \"special\" they are. I will accept that they are special simply on the virtue that they are them, listen to them to find out what they truly love to do and push them to achieve high but realistic expectations. And that's my advice for children of all ages - do what it takes to be whatever you want to be and do the hell out of it.",
    "After reading several biographies, each about 900 pages long, it was a relief to read Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers”, which contains 285 pages of text. Despite its relatively short length, it is a book packed with interesting and unusual information.\n\nThe book is subtitled “The Story of Success”. The thesis is that a person does not achieve success by his or her own abilities, intellect or performance alone, although the 10,000-hour rule is applicable to achieve proficiency in any field. Other important contributors include the time of birth, the growing-up environment, cultural background, and, yes, luck. Most of us are aware of some, if not all, of these influencing factors. What Malcolm Gladwell did in “Outliers” was to tell the stories of how these factors played in the successes of a number of household names such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Robert Oppenheimer, as well as less well known names such as Bill Joy and Joe Flom. He concludes with the story of his own family, telling the reader that her mother, Joyce Gladwell, owes her college education to a series of lucky events. On the other side of the coin, he also told the story of Christopher Langan, whose IQ is similar to Albert Einstein and is regarded by many as well as by himself, as the smartest man in the world. “In his early years, while working as a farmhand, he started to read widely in the area of theoretical physics. At sixteen, he made his way through Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s famously abstruse masterpiece Principia Mathematica.” Yet Langan has yet to achieve any impact in the world because he did not have any support when he grew up. He is said to have written a manuscript entitled “Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU)“, in which he proves the existence of God, the soul and an afterlife, using mathematics. He could not find a publisher of a scientific journal for CTMU because the fact that he had only a year and a half of college worked against him. This is surprising, as I would imagine that the whole human race will be dying to learn his solution of the puzzle (whether God and afterlife exist) which has, since time immemorial, escaped the best scientific, philosophic, and religious minds.\n\nTo drive home the importance of cultural legacy, Gladwell presented a fascinating ethnic theory of plane crashes which should be of interest to folks who take to the sky frequently. There is also an interesting theory of why Asian students did well in mathematics compared to American students. Related to this is the way of expressing numbers and fractions in Chinese versus in English and why the former (Cantonese in particular) is superior.\n\nIn conclusion, a highly entertaining and informative book.",
    "Amazing book… what a simple way to explain the world- a child’s world builds him to be the unique one! Very well executed and explained\n\nMalcolm Gladwell has earned a lifelong fan! Thank you- the world makes sense to me today!",
    "There's an incredible gift of trueness in these pages.\n\nThe insights offered help us to grab onto greatness; to realize we CAN access and be a change agent, and not simply react to those things around us.\n\nWhether ditch digger, pot washer, dog runner or doctor-\n\nWork Hard\nBe Fastidious in Your Craft\nPut in the Hours\nTake Risks to Succeed",
    "Understanding why different can make sucessful or unsucessful. I wish I could have read and understood this when I was just starting out in life, Looking back 10,000 hours developing excelence is realistic.",
    "I was dead wrong about what this book would be about. I had an idea going in and I was ready to read all about it. But I was mistaken. And good thing, too! This book wasn’t about how to be successful like the outliers we know. This book was about opportunities and the way a person can transmute the opportunities they are given into success. Sometimes, success is inevitable simply because the right opportunities were presented at the right time. Mr. Gladwell did a fantastic job with this one! I was thoroughly entertained all the way through.",
    "Liked how what the book says makes a lot of sense.",
    "Having read lots of favourable reviews, I was extremely disappointed. The book essentially argues against the notion that people are born to succeed. If you believe that success is a bit more complicated than that, you may be in for a tedious time ahead as it laboriously tries to convince you against something you never thought in the first place. There is simply not enough here for a book and so the material is stretched out, presenting points that would be common sense to most people seemly expecting the result to be paradigm shifting revelations to the reader. It circles around the same points approaching from a variety of angles, while ignoring any counter arguments you feel should be addressed.\n\nDespite being reported as being \"inspiring\" (it's literally on the front page), it's hard to see why. The book argues the point that success can be largely attributed to a person's circumstances. As most of these are out with anyone's control e.g. the time of year you are born, I struggle to see how anyone could be inspired. The best I can imagine is that someone will feel better that they were not the next success because of factors beyond their control.\n\nThe book tries to make its point by cherry picking studies and examples that will help prove his point. I found one response from authors of a study stating that they thought that Gladwell had misinterpreted and oversimplified their findings and I strongly suspect they were not alone. It presents a series of anecdotes and hypotheses as to why a trend was observed. My issue is that these hypotheses, that are all in keeping with the central theme of the book, are presented as if they were facts, when they are anything but. There is no attempt to give a balanced discussion, exploring arguments, studies or examples not in keeping with the oversimplified central point. Let's be clear, this method of starting with a point you want to make and then working backwards finding \"evidence\" to prove your view is journalism, not science. Gladwell can dress it up as much as he likes with statistics and citations, but don't be fooled, this is not how anyone with any scientific credentials works. Within a few pages I realised I was not reading a book by an expert in the field attempting to make their work accessible to the public, this was written by someone who could write a good story, but had little or no understanding of the scientific method. The book reads like an extended magazine article, perhaps not surprisingly as I was later to find out that the author is indeed a magazine writer.\n\nYou will not learn how to be successful by reading this book. You will not be better informed about what makes someone successful. At best this is a thought piece with a few discussion points worthy of a conversation at your next dinner party and others may enjoy the idea that they could have been as successful as The Beatles or as rich as Bill Gates if they had just been in the right place at the right time. Just a shame that it's not true. I didn't enjoy this book but more than that, I was incensed by it. This is journalism. A pseudoscience stretched out magazine article masquerading as an evidence based insight into success written by a modern day snake oil salesman who has bought into his own hype.",
    "​Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, \"I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better.\"\n\nWhile I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling.\n\nMoreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food?\n\nMy own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more.\n\nThe students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practising. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.)\n\nIn the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters.\n\n\"2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.\"\n\nFriday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, \"So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?\" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, \"YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started.\"\n\nThank you for your work Gladwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities).",
    "Basically, this book *reveals* that people don't gain success through talent and hard work alone; rather they have other, often hidden, advantages. These can be cultural, social, financial, and circumstantial. It also suggests that talent + advantages+ 10000 hours of practice = unusual success. This is demonstrated by a set of examples (The Beatles, Bill Gates etc).\n\nThings I liked:\n\n- Interesting to read the stories of how various people came to success\n\n- Well written\n\n- Somewhat vindicating for those of us who already knew the dice were loaded\n\nReservations:\n\n- How is this a revelation? I felt a bit like this was written for people who are themselves pretty advantaged. If come from a lowly background, with little money or good social connections etc, you KNOW that these things disadvantage you, and you KNOW that those who get ahead, do so because of these advantages.\n\n- There was no follow through. I was expecting (and hoping for) a \"but if you don't have these advantages, you can still do X, Y & Z\". But there was nothing. So if you aren't advantaged, you end up feeling a bit flat at the end.\n\nSummary: Worth a read",
    "It takes a special insight to uncover truths that have always been there, but never been identified. Gladwell brings together evidence - and hindsight - to show how the most special of humans have been the product of their circumstances, opportunities and timing, which allied to hard work and talent makes people outliers. The lesson is that people can thrive only if given the opportunity and resources to do so, and in an oblique way is a damning critique of the winner-takes-all culture in Western societies, and the enormous inequities of inherited wealth and privilege.",
    "I would like to put Gladwell in the same category as Jared Diamond - he writes books that take you on an enjoyable sweep through different places and eras and whole swathes of pop-anthropology but, deep down, I have to wonder *why* he picked a story about dental statistics in 1930s Luxembourg, or the rate of unexplained bus crashes in Peru versus Chile. I can never quite rule out a suspicion of cherry-picking. Which is uncomfortable, because I really *want* to believe these neat stories that let you in on a little secret that underpins whole swathes of the modern world.\n\nLet's go back to a specific example. For instance, Gladwell points out the role of culture in airliner crashes; if aircrew come from cultures that have stronger deference to social superiors, maybe a copilot would shy away from challenging a pilot who'd made a mistake. He works through examples of Korean Airlines crashes that seem to fit this paradigm, and Korea is high up the ranking of countries by deference-to-superiors, and we hear about how Korean Airlines challenged that culture and then had fewer crashes. That's a good story to read! Problem is that we never really tackle the fact that the deadliest airline crash in history involved aircrew from a country which was at the opposite end of the ranking-of-countries. No doubt individual deference to superiors was a factor in that crash too, but CRM alone is pretty boring, people enjoy reading the different-places-different-cultures stories.\n\nI won't say it's all like this; I didn't get such a worry from the study of the backgrounds of lawyers in New York, for instance (maybe we'd see something different if somebody took on the Herculean task of expanding the study to different trades & different national backgrounds, but I don't think the main conclusion would shift much)."

    "The title of Fisher and Ury's book is Getting to Yes - Negotiating Agreement without Giving In. It's a case where the title clearly lays out what the book is about. In Getting to Yes the authors present, step by step, how to find your way to a win-win solution that helps meet your goals while at the same time preserving the relationship so that future negotiations also go smoothly.\n\nThis book was the assigned textbook for a college course I took on negotiation, but it's one of those fairly rare cases where the material that's useful for a college course is also immensely useful for off-the-street people in a variety of situations. This book avoids complicated jargon and long, droning background chapters. Instead, it plunges into helpful information to assist people in negotiating for a new car, negotiating issues with their landlords, and all the many ways we all negotiate for our position throughout life.\n\nNegotiation isn't just for union leaders trying to avert a strike. All of us negotiate each day as we try to juggle our many roles. We negotiate with our co-workers over assignments. We negotiate with our family members over chores. In an ideal world all of those discussions would go quickly, smoothly, and with as little strife as possible.\n\nGetting to Yes provided numerous helpful examples which made their points more easy to understand. It is so true that people tend to remember stories where they might not remember dry text. When I think about this book I do remember several of the stories clearly, and those help to represent the points the authors were making. The stories help remind me to focus on the issues when negotiating and to look for objective standards to work with.\n\nThe information presented is wonderful, and immediately useful in life.\n\nOn the down side, this is a new version of older material. The authors chose to keep the initial book in its original form and then add on additional information at the end. I appreciate for historical reasons why they wanted to do that. However, from a fresh reader point of view, I feel they should present an integrated whole which most clearly presents the full information. The way the book is laid out currently, you have to go back and forth to find all information on a given topic.\n\nAlso, the format is not laid out for easy reference. If they went more for a \"dummies\" style with an easy to scan layout, graphs and charts to quickly find and scan, and quick end-summaries, that would make this more useful as a reference book to keep on a shelf. Right now if I had an issue to handle it would be less than quick to grab the book and find the answer. I would have to wade through the book to figure out where to get the support I needed.\n\nStill, I do recommend that everyone read this book at least once, to build their skills in negotiation. It's something we all have to do!",
    "One of the most important books on negotiation. I think it is quite basic though.",
    "*Getting to Yes* is the book you should've read five years ago. Whether you're asking for a raise, working on a business deal, or dealing with your landlord, if you're looking for more sophistication and success in your negotiation strategies than \"start high\", this is the book for you.\n\n*Getting to Yes* is a complete framework for \"principled negotiation\"–two or more parties working together to best address their mutual interests with creative, objectively fair solutions. If you're unfamiliar with principled negotiation, it's the complete opposite of our conventional image of negotiation: two hard-heads pitted against one another in a battle of will and wit.\n\nThis book is not about mind-bending or psychological tricks–rather. Rather, it is a systematic process to ensure you make the most out of negotiation while achieving a durable outcome, beginning with how to know whether to negotiate at all and what to consider a positive outcome.\n\nThis book is definitely worth a quick review/re-read before any major negotiation. Below is my short field manual for reference.\n\nPlanning:\n\n* Before starting out, develop a BATNA and trip wire so you know exactly what you are trying to get out of negotiation and when it's no longer worth the time. Remember that the reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating.\n* Start listing out (guessing is ok) what the interests of each side are\n* Brainstorm and list out any negative perceptions the other side has about you, and think of ways to counter these perceptions by acting in ways that are inconsistent with them\n* Make note of conflicting interests and brainstorm potential objective criteria for resolving them\n\nNegotiating:\n\n* Clearly identify and list out both side's interests (use a whiteboard) and then focus on a nonjudgmental brainstorming session to come up with ways to address various interests\n* During negotiation, always respond to positions and demands by asking for the principled justification (eg. how did you determine that?)\n* Continue to extract interests from positions and list them\n* Sit side by side facing the problem to reinforce as a team-based problem solving activity\n* Do not back down from your interests. Don't be glued to any positions, but stay hard on your interests and insist they be addressed objectively.\n* Don't fall for the \"let's all agree and put an end to this\" bandwagon.\n* Don't forget about your BATNA and trip wire. Know when to end negotiation.",
    "Wonderful book! Highly recommend.",
    "Not as good or as comprehensive as Dont split the difference. This book discusses more practical thought whereas the others examples are to \"hostage negotiation\". What would be nice is a book that offers actual real world examples geared to the general public negotiating typical large items.",
    "Great for someone who needs to work on their negotiating skills. There are many out there who can gain from even the basic skills as they don't realize how often what you get or earn is not the matter of your worth but how much you can negotiate for yourself. It is sad reality of the world that is build on negotiations. The more you know how to negotiate the easier your life can be.\nNegotiation skills are important in every aspect of life from personal to professional and business settings.\n\nThe basis of negotiations is not to get what you want but to have both sides to get something and feeling good about it. That is an art.\n\nGet it, learn something. Use it. The book can pay off easily in monetary value if you use it first time you buy your car or apply for a job.",
    "I'm astounded that THE definitive book on negotiation has so few reviews.\n\nThis is my second copy. I let someone borrow my first copy, and it never returned. But that's OK. The world would be a better place if everyone learned how to negotiate like this.\n\nIf you're going to a turkish bazaar, this is not going to help guarantee you get the right price for the rug you really want. But if you live in the real world, and especially if you're in business, this will help you understand how to negotiate successfully. And it makes you think differently about how you approach different situations.\n\nRoger Fisher died recently, and I liked the obituary in the Economist. It described how there was a bitter confrontational argument in central america, with one of the parties being Ecuador I believe. Roger Fisher was asked to help in the dispute. Things improved dramatically when he asked the two presidents, who were arguing vehemently and bitterly about the border, to sit down with a map and look at the border. All the posturing disappeared as the parties understood each others concerns. As the obituary concluded, it helped that the Ecuador president had been a university student of Professor Fisher. It shows this is not academic mumbo jumbo. It has real life application.",
    "Really enjoyed this book, probably the best I’ve read on negotiation to date. I found the well thought through logical sequence of the book easy to read and persuasive. It took me from the standard negotiating stance and explained serious errors behind this approach. There was clear guidance on how to move from a positional arbitrary approach to one directed by interests and defined criteria. I’m looking forward to trying out this new framework over the next few months.",
    "I read this book and accomplished a negotiation course. I highly recommend the book for everyone. The book really well breaks down the negotiation process. I use new skill nearly every day now; between buying a new car insurance policy and talking to the Boss!",
    "A classic for anyone going into a negotiation - which is all of us at some time or other, whether in business or personal matters. I had great success (including financial results) from using what I learned from this book in a situation which everyone else had said could never be won.",
    "We all negotiate, whether it is with our employers, employees, partners, friends or even loved ones. We negotiate all the time.\nThis is why I think everyone should read this book, as it seeks to change negotiations from something that looks like a chess game between two opposing sides to a \"lets-work-together\" dialogue. Some of the issues raised in the book were very familiar to me and made perfect sense, others I think are a little bit easier said then done, but overall a good book on how to get the best out of any negotiating process."

    "This is a phenomenal book, written by an author who spent the majority of his 24 years career as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI and its hostage negotiation representative for the National Security Council’s Hostage Working Group. Apart from trained by the bureau, he was also trained in Scotland Yard and Harvard Law School.\n\nBut first and foremost, his negotiation techniques come directly from the tried and tested field, from his experience in the deep jungle of Ecuador, to the separatist area of the Philippines, the slumps of Tahiti, to the many occurrences from within the US including bank robberies, a prison coup, and that bomb threat incident that got Washington DC into a lockdown for 48 hours. Indeed, reading this book feels like watching a very intense action movie, with all the detailed, chaotic, and super-tense scenes.\n\nThe many real-life lessons in the book also come from business world, board meeting battles, investment negotiations, and the various cases that his students faced, from high stake deals to as menial as asking a salary raise.\n\nConstructed the book using these real-life events, the author, Chris Voss, guides us through the negotiation tactics that worked and also the ones that didn’t, which ones became the FBI’s standard practice and which ones were so disastrous they literally cost lives and became the standard of what NOT to do. It is as if we jump directly into these many negotiation situations ourselves and Voss gives us on-the-job training and provides us with the pointers to the live action, which is exhilarating.\n\nAnd those techniques that became time-tested and have since molded into something near perfection? Voss teaches them all in this book.\n\nSo what are the negotiation techniques? At its core lies active listening. Using a relaxed and friendly tone (or as Voss refer as “midnight FM DJ’s tone”), we first try to establish a rapport early on and listen to what our counterpart actually want, labelling their emotions, and validating their words (with the “I see”, “ok”, “uh-huh”, “yes” words).\n\nWe then use mirroring, effective pauses, and calibrated questions to prompt for more reactions and dig for more information, all of which we eventually paraphrase and summarise to show them that we really understand their point of view, in order to create enough trust and feeling of safety for the real conversation to begin.\n\nIn between the sequences, Voss teaches us several hacks, such as explaining why getting a “no” early on is important instead of getting two of the three “yes” (counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment). While a non-commitment “yes” can be used to just get away from the situation, a “no” can actually be an initial word to establish a sense of safety, security, and control for our counterpart, an important inner environment to get them relaxed and ready for a fruitful talk.\n\nThe sequence then proceeds with the objection of getting a “that’s right” from them after we provide the summary, which would confirm where they stand in this negotiation and thus we can get a better measure of our leverages. Voss highlighted that there are 3 different types of leverage that we could identify in the conversation: positive (the ability to give people what they want), negative (the ability to hurt people), and normative (covers the principles and values that our counterpart have).\n\nApart from leverages, different types of characters can also play a big role in the negotiation process, which Voss categorised into 3: the analyst, the accommodator, and the assertive. And he provides all the necessary tools on how to deal with each different one of them.\n\nOf course, the sequence is not rigid and should be fluid depending on the conversation, as we size them up, influence their sizing up on us, while keeping an eye on any potential Black Swans - which are clearly shown in the real-life examples. But none of these tools matter if we cannot control our own emotions, which is a critical part of the interaction. As Voss remark, “[i]f you can’t control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party?”\n\nNegotiation is something we do every single day, whether we realised it or not, no matter how big or small, whether against a high profile counterpart or just bargaining with your own self. It serves two distinct but vital life functions - information gathering and behaviour influencing - where each party wants something from the other side. Hence, this book is a vital one to read, perhaps even one of the most important books you’ll ever going to read, due to its direct practicality for every kind of human interaction in any given situation.\n\nThe importance of the lessons in this book can be seen from the 339 notes that I highlighted, almost twice as many as my normal average of 150+ in any book. It is easily the best book that I’ve read this year, and it’s right up there in the list of my favourite of all time.",
    "I decided to get this book after I listened to Chris Voss on a podcast talking about the skills he teaches. I then read some reviews that said this book was the most practical book there is on negotiations. This book dispelled so many myths I was holding about negotiations. It made the process seem less scary and less aggressive and adversarial. I loved the way Voss teaches skills that anyone can learn, practice, and apply. these are skills that you can use every single day not just in a formal negotiation. As he says, life is a series of negotiations. We negotiate several times a day, but we just don't realize it. I've already tried the mirroring and labeling skills in regular, everyday conversations, and they work! I'm going to try it out at my next work function. I'm an introvert and feel so awkward at these events. I never know what to say or talk about, but mirroring and labeling may be just what I need to get through the night. Voss isn't only teaching negotiation skills. He's also teaching skills on persuasion and influence. This is an easy read packed with so much useful, valuable information. Voss' style is funny and straightforward and packed with a punch for impact.",
    "Let’s get this clear: You don’t get the life you deserve, you get the life you negotiate.\nThat said, who better to guide you in the best techniques for negotiation than someone who was involved in genuinely high-stakes negotiating – world-class ex-FBI hostage negotiator, Chris Voss. Having seen too many B-Grade movies, your perception of dealing with hostage-takers, as was mine, may be assembling an armour-clad SWAT team, getting a clear head shot at the hostage taker, and rescuing the terrified victims.\nAfter seeing too many incidents end in disaster for the victims, the FBI turned to using very sophisticated negotiation techniques. Most business negotiators are raised on the “Getting to Yes” approach of Fisher and Ury. One of their keys to negotiating is the assumption that the other side is going to “act rationally and selfishly in trying to maximize their position.” Your task is to get as much as you can. The only people who come close to doing this are those negotiating with other people’s money and who will make an outsized commission irrespective of the outcome.\nThe book’s title, ‘Never Split the Difference’, highlights the deficiencies in this approach. What is splitting the difference in a hostage negotiation? I’ll give you $5m instead of your asking price of $10m and you kill only 8 hostages and free 12?\n“Negotiation, as you’ll learn it here, is nothing more than communication with results,” Voss explains. The economist Amos Tversky and the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the founders of the field of behavioural economics, won a Nobel Prize for demonstrating that man is in fact, (and even in business,) a very irrational beast.\nThe beauty of the method Voss teaches is how easy it is to grasp the basics, even if it may take years to perfect these techniques. The method Voss describes was developed because it is easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to execute. It was designed for police officers who weren’t interested in becoming academics or therapists. They simply needed a highly effective way of changing the behaviour of the hostage-taker, and to shift the emotional environment of the crisis just enough so that they can secure the safety of everyone involved.\nIf indeed you don’t get what you deserve, only what you ask for, you have to ask correctly. So, claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right.\nThe centrepiece of this book, is ‘Tactical Empathy’ and it works. This doesn’t involve agreeing with the other person’s values and beliefs or giving out hugs, that’s sympathy.\nTactical Empathy is contingent on active listening – listening hard and doing so in a relationship-affirming way. Active Listening involves techniques such as Labelling, Mirroring, Accusation Audit, silences and more. I will address only a few.\nLabelling is repeating your counterpart’s perspective back to them. You will be able to disarm your counterpart’s complaints by repeating them aloud. Labels almost always begin with the same words: It seems like … It looks like… It sounds like … and not “I’m hearing that …” The word “I” gets people’s guard up.\nThere is enough research that indicates that the best way to address negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then label the negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts. “You seem disappointed that the price you were expecting to achieve is being rejected…” Then listen encouragingly so a solution can be found.\nThere are three voices that are useful in a negotiation, one Voss calls the “late-night, FM DJ voice”: it is non-threating, soft, and calming. Talk that starts with “I’m sorry …” and a soft smile, makes people more open to creative solutions because their brains are not freezing in fear or anger.\n“Mirroring” is feeding back to your counterpart what they have just said. Not the body language. Not the accent. Not the tone or delivery. Just the words. Sometimes repeating only the last three words or the critical one to three words of what someone has just said, will produce the desired effect. Your counterpart will inevitably elaborate, and even reveal more information that will further fuel the negotiation. Mirrors work magic.\nBy affirming what you are hearing, you are showing you understand (not support or concur with) your counterpart’s worldview.\n“It seems like you want us to let you go.” Or “It seems like you don’t want to go ahead with the sale under these conditions.” When they can say to you “That’s right…” you have connected in a meaningful way that will allow for the exploration of other options. If they had said, “You’re right…” more often than not, they are fobbing you off.\n“I always try to reinforce the message that being right isn’t the key to a successful negotiation—having the right mindset is,” Voss explains. Negotiation is not a battle between opposing forces.\nBy doing an accusation audit in advance, you can often surface what is their concern upfront and eliminate it. When teaching negotiation, Voss invites students to roleplay. Knowing what is going to bother them, he introduces the process with: “In case you’re worried about volunteering to roleplay with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance … it’s going to be horrible… (But) those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else.” The response is always positive.\nBy listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, you can address it, with playful seriousness, and elicit the useful ‘That’s right…’ reponse.\n“In the decades since my initiation into the world of high-stakes negotiations, I’ve been struck again and again by how valuable these seemingly simple approaches can be. The ability to get inside the head—and eventually under the skin—of your counterpart depends on these techniques and a willingness to change your approach, based on new evidence, along the way.”\nThis is a remarkably engaging book, that reads like a novel, complete with reports of Voss’s gripping experiences chosen to highlight what he teaches. This is a must read for anyone whose work involves negotiation. For those who are not so engaged, read it anyway even if your most serious negotiation is your noisy neighbour or getting a seat on a “fully booked” flight.\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of the recently released Executive Update.",
    "One of the reviews i read about this book stated that \"this book is such an eye opener\"! I tried very hard to enjoy this book, and persevered as much as i could but the writing style is hard to connect with and i found the author to be quite egotistical whilst making outrageous claims backed up with \"Trump-esque\" back stories eg it was a very very bad situation... but i did something really really great... probably better than anyone has ever handled a situation like this before blah blah! There is nothing new in this book. I still have no idea how this book could have gotten such great reviews. Poor examples throughout, very boringly written and page after page became more and more frustrating. This is not an eye-opener! I struggled to keep my eyes open!!\n\nI had high hopes for this book... waste of money. I've just thrown it into the bin!",
    "I have read the book and watched a pile of Chris Voss Youtube videos.\nThis stuff works a treat if, and only if you are willing to put the methods into practice\non a daily basis. I am using it constantly every single day and it has produced amazing results.\nAs Chris Voss said \"everything is a negotiation\" and I would agree 100% it's just i've never noticed it before..but i do now.\nTry it out for yourself, you will be surprised at how effective it is.\nJust be prepared to put in the work required to learn a new skill. I really had to laugh at one of the negative reviews that implied they should\nnow be a skilled negotiator as if reading the book once worked like some sort of osmosis straight from Chris Voss.\nYeah...get real mate.",
    "Great book. The stories Chris tells helps me to retain the concepts he's putting across and those concepts really do seem to work.\n\nA couple of weeks after starting the book I negotiated a vendor at work from a 'list price' of about £68,000 for some equipment down to about £22,000*, partly by applying techniques from this book. Given that I spent £4.45 on the book, I think it's paid for itself by now.\n\n*Obviously, having read the book my final offer was not a rounded number. Read it yourself, and you'll see what I mean.",
    "I occasionally saw an interview with Chris Voss on YouTube and it mentioned this book, so I decided to get the book. It turned out this probably the best few quid I have spent in a very long time.\n\nI am half way through the book, it took a while to read as I have decided to digest the techniques and to see how effective they are.\n\nI have applied mirroring, showing empathy labelling techniques when I communicating with my daughter and I found I have stopped saying no to her automatically and the relationship has improved since.",
    "I’m enjoying the book but I’m dismayed by the poor quality of the book with some pages printed in a way that sentences are missing. I’ve never seen this before. See pictures.\n\nThe poor printing is not the whole book and only on a dozen pages. But still, very disappointing."

    "While the subtitle of this book (How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action) suggests that the content is for leaders of large organizations, I believe the book's details can apply to all kinds of leaders and businesses.\nThe main mantra of the book is:\n\nPeople don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.\n\nThe book includes stories of many different companies. Some were successful, and others were not. The successful ones were led by individuals who strongly believed in something (they had a Why), which was the business's guiding principle. The unsuccessful companies may have started out doing well, but when they lost their focus on their Why, or if the person who had that vision left the organization, the business started to falter.\n\nI agree with the author’s point that having a strong Why for your business can help that business be successful. I highlighted all the successful companies and individuals in the book and want to study them further. Here’s an alphabetical list of who I intend to examine:\n\n- Apple & Steve Jobs\n- Bridgeport Financial\n- Ernest Shackleton\n- Harley Davidson\n- Henry Ford\n- Ron Bruder — Education for Employment Foundation\n- Southwest Airlines\n- Thomas Edison\n- The Wright Brothers\n\nOne key concept from the book that hit home with me was that when you have a strong Why you will naturally attract individuals to your business who share that Why. A strong Why will allow you to market based on these beliefs instead of using manipulative tactics like price, features, and benefits.\n\nThat’s what a WHY does. When it is clearly understood, it attracts people who believe the same thing.\n\nAnother central point Why is so important relates to hiring (or being hired). It’s essential to have everyone in an organization believe in the same Why to have the best performing team. This requires a leader who knows their Why and knows how to share the details of their Why with others.\n\nWhile reading the books, I made some other highlights that I think were important concepts:\n\n- “There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.”\n- “WHAT companies do are external factors, but WHY they do it is something deeper.”\n- “Why the product exists must first be considered and why someone wants it must match.”\n- “If a customer feels inspired to buy a product, rather than manipulated, they will be able to verbalize the reasons why they think what they bought is better.”\n- “Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it is the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility.”\n- “No matter where we go, we trust those with whom we are able to perceive common values or beliefs.”\n\nThis book has helped me personally. I’m in the process of trying to start a business, teaching others how to use productivity software (so far just Microsoft Excel, but I have plans to branch out to other applications). My training content is specifically geared towards those who may be intimidated by software and computers in general.\n\nI need to spend more time thinking about my Why, but my initial Why is that I believe anyone can learn to use productivity software; they need to get past any fear of using the software and computers. I think the biggest fear people have when learning new things is the fear of the unknown. I want to show people it’s not hard to learn to use software and computers if they take a little time to learn the basics. I want to help them convert the unknown to a known.\n\nIf you’ve thought about starting or are running your own business, do you know your Why? Is your Why evident in everything you do related to that business? If not, I would urge you to take some time to read Start With Why and to get clear on your Why.",
    "THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK EVER PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS!!!\n\nIf I could give this book 10 stars, I would! This book beats many other books. This book is so exciting to read that I read it three times! The beginning of the book said it extremely well -- This book is about an unique kind of leadership that has the natural recurring pattern of inspiring, influencing and affecting people. It is about a very small group of leaders that achieve disproportionate amount of influences in their industries/areas compare to other leaders. The most prominent example is, of course, Steve Jobs who displayed a recurring pattern of changing one industry after another.\n\n(Of all the books that study Steve Jobs, this is probably the best one although it is not a book on Jobs' biography. However, this book offers the best angle to understand his motivation and influence.)\n\nThe core of this book is about the kind of WHYs that a special kind of leaders has that enable them to have the natural recurring pattern of inspiring, influencing and changing people and industries. The prime examples of this kind of leaders quoted in this book are Steve Jobs, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Wright Brothers.\n\nThis book is revolutionary. All the top business schools should reevaluate their curriculum based on this book! All the top business consultants should reconsider their theories and recommendations based on this book! All the writers on leadership should read this book and revise their theories! All political leaders in the world should read this book! All board of directors of corporations should read this book and learn how to select the next CEOs! ...\n\nThis book can be considered the MASTER book to be read before reading books like \"From Good to Great\", \"Stall Points\", \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" and the follow-on books, \"Crossing the Chasm\" ...\n\nThe central theme of this book is WHY -- the essence, the core, the purpose of a person's life, of leadership, and the starting point of a corporation. Without the clarity of this WHY, the life of a person, the leadership, and the products and services offered by a corporation are all fuzzy and treated as commodities. This is so very true. Look around us: Though we (persons, organizations and corporations) are special in some ways, yet we are almost all commodities -- except the very few that display the recurring pattern of major changes and influences such as Jobs, Apple and Google. These are the ones that have the clarity of WHY and the discipline of diligently and strictly enforcing their HOWs (principles, methods, criteria) in producing the WHATs (behaviors, products and services).\n\nThere are three views of WHY + HOW + WHAT presented in this book:\n1. Looking from the top -- the WHY in the center, the HOW in the middle and the WHAT in the outer layer form a GOLDEN CIRCLE.\n2. Looking from the side -- the WHY at the top layer, the HOW in the middle layer and the WHAT in the bottom layer form a cone.\n3. Viewing in three dimensions -- with the external world attached to the base of WHAT, the whole thing is a megaphone for the leader or corporation to sound out its WHY.\n\nThese views are wonderful ways for us to look at leadership, to understand the life cycle of a corporation, and summarily see why companies thrived and why they died. These views can even be applied to our personal lives.\n\nOf course, this book has some blemishes. But these defects do not distract from its greatness.\n1. The grammar is terrible. The whole book should be reviewed by a competent editor.\n2. The WHYs are not strictly examined and evaluated. This book treats all WHYs from leaders, entrepreneurs and corporations as equal when in fact they are not. Probably most of the WHYs are the rewording of WHATs in disguise. Maybe a lot of WHYs are re-branded HOWs. Perhaps only a small number of WHYs can have the recurring pattern of inspiration and influence. I hope the future editions of this book can elucidate this point.\n3. The HOWs gets much less treatment than the WHYs and WHATs in the book. It would be great if this topic is covered in more detail.\n4. Maybe 60% of this book is about corporations and not on leadership as claimed in the beginning of the book. I hope the author can focus more on the recurring pattern of inspiration and influence of leadership.\n5. Not everything stated in this book is correct. The points discussed in this book about Jobs and Apple are good examples. Please read \"Inside Apple\" and Jobs biographies for more correct views on Jobs and Apple.\n\nAt the first reading, the book seems repetitious. The WHY, HOW and WHAT get repeated over and over. However, on the 2nd and 3rd reading, this apparent repetition disappears and you can see the different points that the author was trying to emphasize.\n\nI would like to recommend some future topics or books for Simon Sinek:\na) Qualify and rank levels of WHYs -- not all WHYs are equal. Probably some are top-notch while most are mediocre. Also, tell us how to construct best kinds of WHYs.\nb) Compare the WHYs to big tech companies, the WHYs of big Wall Street firms (if they have any???) and the WHYs of big retail companies.\nc) Compare the WHYs of big empires in history\nd) Compare the WHYs of nations in WWI and WWII\ne) Compare the WHYs of great leaders in history\nf) Compare the WHYs of great geniuses\ng) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into Teachers' College (Ed College). It is the teachers who educate our future generations. They need to be thoroughly immersed in the understanding of The Golden Circle, The Cone and The Megaphone.\nh) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into the K-12 and the college education\ng) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into and how HOWs can be enforced in our political systems. We have far too many politicians and not enough true leaders\ni) Consider how WHYs can be incorporated into our law schools. Our lawyers really need a strong dose of treatment.\n\nIn summary, this book is dynamic. It's a dynamite! It's the best book I have read in the last 10 years!",
    "I love Sinek's talks and although there is wisdom, points to take away and actions you can use in this book I did find that it was a lot of pages which can be condensed down into about five. I find the same thing with a lot of these books. Really, you can just watch the various YouTube videos to get the major points from this book and learnings. However, he does offer some interesting examples and working case studies. Like I said, it does contain a lot of unnecessary drool to get some simple points across and repetition of messages.",
    "Loved the TED talk. And loved parts of this book. The only problem is - this book would have taken up less than 100 pages to convey its message clearly. WHY did it have to be 225 pages? I have no idea. Some sentences like, \"People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it\" are repeated so many times, I have lost count. If someone were to wake me from my sleep, I'd probably be repeating that sentence.\n\nI find it funny that a book about WHY missed out on mentioning something called, \"The theory of 5 Whys\"- Look it up, it is something a lot of companies use to brainstorm problems. It also has no comment on Friedrich Nietzsche - \"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW.\" I believe what applies to life also eventually applies to business life.\n\nAnd as it is a business book, its only focus is on the importance of WHY in businesses and large scale social movements. There is no example of how this concept affects and benefits an individual on a more personal scale - i.e. in relationships, health, etc. Chapter 13 - where the author shares his own story of arriving at this concept is the only place where he has touched on it in a lukewarm manner. Though, I believe there is another book follow-up book called 'Find Your Why' for the same purpose. If you are looking for a personal WHY, do read Stephen Covey's - The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\n\nShould you read the book, if you have watched the TED talk?\n- Yes, if you are looking for more detailed examples and studies and researches. Though a lot of it is focused on Apple and Southwest Airlines and Walmart.\n- No, if you already have a clear sense of WHY in everything you think, say and do. (i.e. self-awareness)\n\n[I bought a paperback version by Portfolio Penguin, and the fonts, binding and print are all okay]",
    "Although the book describes certainly positive approaches to leading any enterprise, in the line of having an intrinsic motivation, it fails by extracting them from a posteriori success stories. It is easy to fall in the fallacy that those who came to our days as successful leaders did it, overall, because of their personal traits or attitudes. The book even dismisses randomness or the complexities or real world events as the real cause of some of this success stories. But even figures like Bill Gates recognise how lucky they were with their life circumstances (e.g. having access to the first personal computers at school) in order to get where they were. But of course most people looking for success formulas won’t find so attractive a book that includes something out of their control as part of the education. But the truth is that being realistic is always the closets path to any kind of success. This book it isn’t.",
    "This book is average at best. It's rambling at times, and goes off on tangents to the main thesis of the book. Whilst he's a gifted public speaker, this book has a distinct amateurish self-published feel to it. The 'scientific basis' for many of his points is so simplistic as to be comical. Sinek has no scientific training and it shows. He cherry picks from neuroscience, and doesn't seem to understand the subject he's quoting from. It reads as though he read a Wikipedia entry on neuroscience and made some inferences from that. I would not recommend this book, although I do recommend his public speaking, which can be found on YouTube and on TEDTalks.",
    "Warum alle diese doch recht einfachen Gedankengang des \"Why\" so abfeiern, erschließ sich mir nicht. Der Gedankengang, dass Marken sich über andere Faktoren außer dem Preis und vermeintlicher Benefits abgrenzen müssen, ist allgemein klar und wird im Buch etwas zu ausführlich (eigentlich durchgehend) erklärt. Und ein \"Why\" kann dabei helfen. Seine Thesen stützt er – wie so viele andere Markentheoretiker – im wesentlichen auf den Erfolg von Apple. Wie viele Bücher schon den Erfolg von Apple analysiert haben und ihre eigene These dazu nützen, ist mittlerweile unüberschaubar. Aber nur weil Apple den Kunden ein \"Why\" bietet, sind sie nicht erfolgreich, das ist zu kurz gedacht und das sollte absolut jedem bekannt sein. Dann könnte ja jeder den einfach Erfolg kopieren.\nÄrgerlich ist, dass der Inhalt des Buches auf 20 Seiten gepasst hätte und dass es keinerlei Anleitung gibt, wie der Leser, denn für sich selbst das Why/How/What definieren kann. Dafür muss man wohl einen überteuerten Workshop von Sinek buchen. Fazit: 20% interessante Gedanken, 80% aufgeblasene Zeitverschwendung."

    "Jordan Peterson is a beacon of light in this chaotic world, a psychologist whose writing combines science and common sense. One of his talents is his ability to articulate complex ideas to a wide audience. Regardless of whether you have a background in psychology or not, you will understand this book. It covers his twelve rules for life, which are intended not only as a guide for life of the individual, but as a remedy for society’s present ills. Peterson believes that the cure for society starts with curing the individual, the smallest unit of society. Peterson’s well-known advice to clean your room is a reflection of the truth that if you can’t even manage the most basic and mundane responsibilities of life, then you have no business dictating to others how to fix society.\n\nOne of the main themes of this book is: Personal change is possible. There's no doubt you can be slightly better today than you were yesterday. Because of Pareto's Principle (small changes can have disproportionately large results), this movement towards the good increases massively, and this upward trajectory can take your life out of hell more rapidly than you could believe. Life is tragic and full of suffering and malevolence. But there's something you can start putting right, and we can't imagine what good things are in store for us if we just fix the things that are within our power to do so.\n\nThe 12 Rules for Life:\n\nIn Peterson’s own words, it’s 12 rules to stop you from being pathetic, written from the perspective of someone who himself tried to stop being pathetic and is still working on it. Peterson is open about his struggles and shortcomings, unlike many authors who only reveal a carefully curated façade.\n\nRule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back. People have bad posture, and the meaning behind it can be demonstrated by animal behaviors. Peterson uses the example of the lobster. When a lobster loses a fight, and they fight all the time, it scrunches up a little. Lobsters run on serotonin and when he loses, levels go down, and when he wins, levels go up and he stretches out and is confident. Who cares? We evolutionarily diverged from lobsters 350 million years ago, but it’s still the same circuit. It’s a deep instinct to size others up when looking at them to see where they fit in the social hierarchy. If your serotonin levels fall, you get depressed and crunch forward and you’re inviting more oppression from predator personalities and can get stuck in a loop. Fixing our posture is part of the psycho-physiological loop that can help you get started back up again.\n\nRule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. People often have self-contempt whether they realize it or not. Imagine someone you love and treat well. You need to treat yourself with the same respect. Take care of yourself, your room, your things, and have respect for yourself as if you’re a person with potential and is important to the people around you. If you make a pattern of bad mistakes, your life gets worse, not just for you, but for the people around you. All your actions echo in ways that cannot be imagined. Think of Stalin’s mother and the mistakes she made in life, and how the ripple effects went on to affect the millions of people around him.\n\nRule 3: Choose your friends carefully. It is appropriate for you to evaluate your social surroundings and eliminate those who are hurting you. You have no ethical obligation to associate with people who are making your life worse. In fact, you are obligated to disassociate with people who are trying to destroy the structure of being, your being, society’s being. It’s not cruel, it’s sending a message that some behaviors are not to be tolerated.\n\nRule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. You need to improve, and you may even be in real bad shape, but many unfairly compare themselves to some more seemingly successful person. Up till around age 17, random comparisons to other people can make sense, but afterwards, especially age 30+, our lives become so idiosyncratic that comparisons with others become meaningless and unhelpful. You only see a slice of their life, a public facet, and are blind to the problems they conceal.\n\nRule 5: Don't let children do things that make you dislike them. You aren't as nice as you think, and you will unconsciously take revenge on them. You are massively more powerful than your children, and have the ability and subconscious proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted within you.If you don't think this is true, you don't know yourself well enough. His advice on disciplinary procedure: (1) limit the rules. (2) use minimum necessary force and (3) parents should come in pairs.It's difficult and exhausting to raise children, and it's easy to make mistakes. A bad day at work, fatigue, hunger, stress, etc, can make you unreasonable.\n\nRule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. Life is tragic and there's malevolence. There's plenty to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places. The diaries of the Columbine killers are a chilling look into minds that dwelled on the unholy trinity of deceit, arrogance, and resentment) . So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, transform into something meaningful. Start by stop doing something, anything, that you know to be wrong. Everyday you have choices in front of you. Stop doing and saying things that make you weak and ashamed. Do only those things that you would proudly talk about in public.\n\nRule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient). Meaning is how you protect yourself against the suffering that life entails. This means that despite the fact that we’re all emotionally wounded by life, we’ve found something that makes it all worthwhile. Meaning, Peterson says, is like an instinct, or a form of vision. It lets you know when you’re in the right place, and he says that the right place is midway between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you can’t grow. If you stay within chaos, then you’re lost. Expediency is what you do to get yourself out of trouble here and now, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the future for the present. So instead of doing what gets you off the hook today, aim high. Look around you and see what you can make better. Make it better. As you gain knowledge, consciously remain humble and avoid arrogance that can stealthily creep on you. Peterson also says to be aware of our shortcomings, whatever they may be; our secret resentments, hatred, cowardice, and other failings. Be slow to accuse others because we too conceal malevolent impulses, and certainly before we attempt to fix the world.\n\nRule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie. Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that it’s often difficult to know the truth. However, we can know when we’re lying. Telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too. Meaning, according to Peterson, is associated with truth, and lying is the antithesis of meaning. Lying disassociates you with meaning, and thus reality itself. You might get away with lying for a short while, but only a short time. In Peterson’s words “It was the great and the small lies of the Nazi and Communist states that produced the deaths of millions of people.”\n\nRule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't. A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If you’re more verbally fluent than the other person then you can win. One problem is that the other person might see something better than you, but they can’t quite articulate it as well. Always listen because there’s a possibility they’re going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to your enemies. They will lie about you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends won’t. Separate the wheat from the chaff and make your life better.\n\nRule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech: There is some integral connection between communication and reality (or structures of belief as he likes to say). Language takes chaos and makes it into a ‘thing.’ As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. This mysterious thing that’s bothering you—is it real? Yes, if it’s manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. The unnameable is far more terrifying than the nameable. As an example, the movie the Blair Witch project didn’t actually name or describe the evil. Nothing happens in the movie, it’s all about the unnameable. If you can’t name something, it means it’s so terrifying to you that you can’t even think about it, and that makes you weaker. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you don’t want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise speech.\n\nRule 11: Don’t bother children when they are skateboarding. This is mainly about masculinity. Peterson remembers seeing children doing all kinds of crazy stunts on skateboards and handrails, and believes this is an essential ingredient to develop masculinity, to try to develop competence and face danger. Jordan Peterson considers the act of sliding down a handrail to be brave and perhaps stupid as well, but overall positive. A lot of rebellious behavior in school is often called ‘toxic masculinity,’ but Peterson would say to let them be. An example would be a figure skater that makes a 9.9 on her performance, essentially perfect. Then the next skater that follows her seems to have no hope. But she pushes herself closer to chaos, beyond her competence, and when successful, inspires awe. Judges award her 10’s. She’s gone beyond perfection into the unknown and ennobled herself as well as humanity as well.\n\nRule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. This chapter is mainly autobiographical and he writes about tragedy and pain. When tragic things are in front of you and you’re somewhat powerless, you must keep your eyes open for little opportunities that highlight the redemptive elements of life that make it all worthwhile. The title of this chapter comes from his experience of observing a local stray cat, and watching it adapt to the rough circumstances around it. Another thing you must do when life is going to pieces is to shorten your temporal horizon. Instead of thinking in months, you maybe think in hours or minutes instead. You try to just have the best next minute or hour that you can. You shrink the time frame until you can handle it, this is how you adjust to the catastrophe. You try to stay on your feet and think. Although this chapters deals about harsh things, it’s an overall positive one. Always look for what’s meaningful and soul-sustaining even when you’re where you’d rather not be.",
    "My favorite scholar is the American Jesuit polymath Walter J. Ong (1912-2003; Ph.D. in English, Harvard University, 1955). Now, in the American Catholic subculture in the United States, it is customary to address celibate priests with the honorific title “Father” – for example, Father Ong. In certain other cultures around the world, the honorific term “Father” is also used to address specific men. Whether or not celibate priests always live up to this honorific title, they are supposed to stand as father figures to the faithful. In our Western tradition of philosophic thought, Aristotle as a real father famously wrote a treatise on ethics for his real son – after whose name the treatise is now known as the Nicomachean Ethics (University of Chicago Press, 2011).\n\nIn his new book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Toronto: Random House Canada, 2018), the Canadian psychology professor at the University of Toronto and practicing psychotherapist Jordan B. Peterson presents himself as a father figure on a mission to instruct and enlighten perplexed young men who have grown up under the influence of the verbal ventilation of feminists against the so-called “patriarchy” (etymologically, this word refers to fathers) – just as the men’s movement of the 1990s attempted to reach out to perplexed young men. His writing style is chatty and meandering, but your guess is as good as mine as to how many perplexed young men are willing to read the 370 pages of his chatty and meandering text. But at least he is fighting the good fight against feminist zealotry – just as Paglia has in recent decades.\n\nBut so-called second-wave feminists and later feminists have excelled in denouncing the so-called “patriarchy” (i.e., father figures) in Western culture. Nevertheless, Father Ong tried to the best of his ability to alert feminists about the male agonistic (contesting) spirit in his book Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (Cornell University Press, 1981), the published version of his 1979 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University – but to little avail. Despite Father Ong’s best efforts, feminists of both the female and the male varieties have verbally ventilated against the so-called “patriarchy” for decades now.\n\nOng imagined his 1981 book to be a non-materialist’s contribution to sociobiology as pioneered by the philosophical materialist E. O. Wilson (1975). Even though Plato and Aristotle lived centuries before Darwin and others, including Wilson, formulated evolutionary theory, Plato and Aristotle understood that we humans are basically animals, but with a significant difference – we have human reason to direct our animal tendencies – later known as our concupiscible and irascible tendencies. In the Phaedrus, Plato uses the famous imagery of a charioteer directing two powerful horses pulling the chariot/body. The two powerful horses represent the strong animal spirits known as our concupiscible and irascible tendencies. Both Plato and Aristotle use the Greek term transliterated as “thumos” (or “thymos”) to refer to our animal spirit known as our irascible tendencies. But in Ong’s 1981 book, he does not happen to advert explicitly to Plato’s or Aristotle’s discussion of “thumos” (or “thymos”). Nevertheless, what Ong refers to as the male agonistic (contesting) spirit is a manifestation of what Plato and Aristotle refer to as “thumos” (or “thymos”).\n\nNow, in general, Plato and Aristotle and certain other ancient Greek thinkers thought of virtue as the mean between extremes. Courage is the virtue that our animal spirit of “thumos” (or “thymos”) needs to become a pro-social force for fighting the good fight. The virtue of courage represents the mean between the extremes of pusillanimity and brashness. In today’s parlance, the virtue of courage represents proper assertiveness – not the extremes of non-assertiveness (passivity) and hostile assertiveness.\n\nFor Aristotle’s discussion of “thumos” (or “thymos”) in the political arena, see Barbara Koziak’s book Retrieving Political Emotion: Thumos, Aristotle, and Gender (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000).\n\nBy the 1990s, certain men such as the American poet Robert Bly and the Jungian psychotherapist and theorist Robert Moore were concerned enough about the feminists’ verbal ventilation against so-called “patriarchy” that they attempted to start a men’s movement. With Douglas Gillette as co-author, Moore published five important books about the archetypes of the mature masculine (1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a, 1993b). But the efforts of the men’s movement were of little avail against the verbal ventilation of the feminists against the so-called “patriarchy.”\n\nIn the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, I should also give Camille Paglia credit for her spirited critique of feminist zealotry in her book Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (Yale University Press, 1990) – but to little avail. No doubt the scholarly acumen that Paglia manifests in her book is impressive. However, her book is also sui generis. Not even Paglia herself has published a follow-up volume. But she has continued to inveigh incisively against feminist zealotry.\n\nBecause Paglia’s 1990 book is the revised version of her doctoral dissertation in English at Yale University, I would point out that Ong’s massively researched doctoral dissertation in English at Harvard University was published, slightly revised as the book Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason (Harvard University Press, 1958). Like Paglia, Ong subsequently never published such a thoroughly researched book. Incidentally, Peterson’s first book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (Routledge, 1999) is thoroughly researched.\n\nIn Ong’s 1981 book Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness, he discusses (pages 18-19, 25, 92, 100, 111, 115, and 148) the Jungian Israeli psychoanalyst Erich Neumann’s book The Origins and History of Consciousness (1954). In Paglia’s 1990 book Sexual Personae, she discusses (pages 42, 43, 47, 52, 88, 93, and 380) Neumann’s books The Origins and History of Consciousness (1954) and The Great Mother (1955). In Peterson’s new book, he also discusses (pages 323; 374, note 37; 387, notes 203 and 204) Neumann’s two most widely known books). In addition, Peterson discusses (pages 59-60, 180, 185, 188, 189, 193, 195, 198-199, 215, 288, 289-290, and 323) Jung extensively. In the endnotes, Peterson provides bibliographic references to Jung’s publications only twice (page 381, notes 134 and 139). However, in Peterson’s 1999 book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, mentioned above, he refers to 15 of Jung’s specific publications (page 507).\n\nJust as feminist zealotry is the predominant ideology of the Democratic Party in its zealotry for identity politics, so too anti-abortion zealotry is the predominant ideology of social conservatives in the Republican Party – which also includes economic libertarians. Feminist zealotry has been reinvigorated recently by the Harvey Weinstein affair and related down-sizing of certain other male sexual predators – but not of President Trump, the playboy sexual predator.\n\nHowever, President Trump has also been criticized for being an agent of chaos, and Peterson claims that he has formulated 12 rules for life as an antidote to chaos – Trump. So with Trump’s chaos dominating news cycles, Peterson may get a hearing for his 12 rules.\n\nWith our ego-consciousness, we strive to establish order in our lives. But chaos can overcome us. When chaos disrupts our lives, we usually experience abandonment feelings. Our efforts to resolve our abandonment feelings aim to restore our sense of order in our lives. Because Trump’s chaos disturbs many Americans, those Americans need to work to restore their sense of order in their lives.\n\nNevertheless, the Americans who voted for Trump saw him favorably as a disrupter of the establishment order. Thus, even for Trump voters, Peterson’s contrast of chaos and order can work to characterize what they saw in him that enabled them to vote for him.\n\nPut differently, the 2016 presidential election featured an electoral contest between two competing predominant orders, and similarly, between two competing senses of chaos.\n\nBut Peterson claims that he wants to see more people confront chaos in their own personal lives and somehow manage to work out a renewed sense of order in their lives. He sees all 12 of his rules for life as oriented to doing this. Consequently, in theory, both Democrats and Republicans might benefit from following his 12 rules for life.\n\nRule 1 is “Stand Up Straight with Your Shoulders Back” (pages 1-28). Peterson’s exposition of Rule 1 involves a brilliant account of evolutionary psychology. This chapter alone is worth the price of the book.\n\nBut Peterson’s account of evolutionary psychology should be complemented and further developed with Pete Walker’s account of our fight, flight, freeze, and fawn responses in his excellent self-help book Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving (2013). Because Ong’s book, mentioned above, is titled Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (1982), we should note that the title accentuates the fight response pattern delineated by Walker.\n\nPeterson’s account of evolutionary psychology deepens our understanding of Vance Packard’s book The Status Seekers (1959). The developer Donald J. Trump exemplifies the spirit of alpha male status seekers. In contrast, Pope Francis exemplifies the Christian counter-spirit of certain other alpha males seeking to distinguish themselves through loving service of others. Basically, however, both Trump and Francis exemplify the fight response pattern that Walker delineates.\n\nRule 2 is “Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible for Helping” (pages 31-64). Basically, the helping spirit discussed by Peterson represents the fawn response pattern discussed by Walker. As Peterson discusses in rule 2, we often tend to help others far more eagerly than we tend to help and care for ourselves. But when we help others and ignore ourselves, we run the risk of experiencing burnout.\n\nRule 3 is “Make Friends with People Who Want the Best for You” (pages 67-83).\n\nRule 4 is “Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else Is Today” (pages 85-111).\n\nRule 5 is “Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them” (pages 113-144).\n\nRule 6 is “Set Your House in Perfect Order Before You Criticize the World” (pages 147-159). But President Trump’s White House is not known for its order, but for its chaos. Both Trump and Pope Francis like to criticize the world.\n\nRule 7 is “Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What Is Expedient)” (pages 161-201).\n\nRule 8 is “Tell the Truth – Or At Least, Don’t Lie” (pages 203-230). Ah, if only President Trump would tell the truth – or at least not lie!\n\nRule 9 is “Assume That the Person You Are Listening to Might Know Something You Don’t” (pages 233-256). I was really impressed with Peterson’s discussion of Carl Rogers’ account of interpersonal communication.\n\nRule 10 is “Be Precise in Your Speech” (pages 259-283). In Ong’s publications, he writes with precision – and concision.\n\nRule 11 is “Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding” (pages 285-332).\n\nRule 12 is “Pet a Cat When You Encounter One on the Street” (pages 335-353).\n\nPeterson rounds off the text of his book with a “Coda” (pages 355-368). His book also includes a lengthy “Foreword” by Norman Doidge, M.D. (pages vii-xxiv), an “Overture” by Peterson (pages xxv-xxxv), “Acknowledgements” (pages 369-370), “Endnotes” (pages 371-389), and an “Index” (pages 390-409).\n\nHowever, whatever merit Peterson’s 12 rules may have in the practical order, I would urge young men and women to undertake the three conversion processes that the Canadian Jesuit theologian and philosopher Bernard Lonergan (1904-1984) outlines in his philosophical masterpiece Insight: A Study of Human Understanding, 5th ed. (University of Toronto Press, 1992): (1) intellectual conversion involves their orientation to the intelligible; (2) moral conversion involves changing the criterion of their decision-making and choices from satisfactions to values (arguably similar in spirit to Peterson’s rule 7); and (3) religious conversion involves being grasped by ultimate concern (also known as God).\n\nRegarding what Father Lonergan refers to as intellectual conversion, I would also call attention to Martha C. Nussbaum’s article “Human Functioning and Social Justice: In Defense of Aristotelian Essentialism” in the journal Political Theory, volume 20, number 2 (May 1992): pages 202-246.\n\nPeople who do not experience what Lonergan refers to as intellectual conversion tend to live out their lives as tricksters dedicated to verbal trickery.\n\nIn conclusion, I admire Peterson for writing his new book as a father figure offering guidance for perplexed young men by setting forth 12 rules for life for them to follow. However, I think that Father Ong and Father Lonergan offer more salient and cogent guidance to young men and women.",
    "I quite like Jordan Peterson. I think he has interesting things to say. I think he's unfairly criticised, often for things he hasn't said. I was curious what he had to say here so I went as far as paying money to find out, which was a mistake.\n\nI think he should roll back on criticising other people's writing (rule 6: get your own house in order). I quickly got bogged down when rather than illustrate and explain his point he rambled off on some exegesis of the first chapters of Genesis. You can't draw timeless truths from books that are neither timeless nor true and I wish he would get over this thing he has for holy books. When he sticks to evolutionary biology he starts to say interesting and useful things. I enjoyed reading another passage about his hometown I dipped into but trawling through biblical passages waiting for him to make a point is extremely tiresome. My copy will be available soon through a 2nd hand book charity on here if you want it. As new, partially read.",
    "I like Jordan Peterson a lot. I’ve particularly enjoyed his explanations and verbal jousting with some of his interviewers, so I was looking forward to reading this book to understand more about his opinions.\n\nI enjoyed the anecdotes and personal stories, which mostly come in the second half of the book. Unfortunately, I found the first half of the book hard going and it seems that most of his foundational ideas are taken from Heidegger’s concept of ‘Being’ which Peterson does not try to justify or explain, he just takes it for granted even though apparently Heidegger struggled to explain it (page xxxi).\n\nPeterson gives case after case where we should take responsibility, tell the truth, repair what’s broken, obey rules and standards and have values and moral obligations, yet without once explaining how any of these things can exist given his evolutionary, materialistic view of life.\n\nIn particular, he doesn’t seem to take proper account of the is-ought problem and appears to me at least, to commit the naturalistic fallacy in moving from describing the way the world is suffering (is) and then tells us what we should do about it (ought) without proper justification.",
    "If you have not noticed, there is a problem in our society. True, there are many problems, but one is particularly pressing. This is nihilism, the absence of meaning in the sense of both ultimate goals and present values. Nihilism stands behind much of the purposelessness, joylessness, and moral chaos of our society. It has been particularly devastating to young males in North America, the audience for whom Jordan Peterson’s writing and videos appear to be created and by whom they are most eagerly received. Peterson offers meaning, order amidst the chaos of our society; he proffers purpose, a way forward towards fulfillment; he even offers happiness, the reward that comes at the end of the intentional pursuit of meaningful living.\nLet’s be clear, what he is offering is a gospel, good news for the lost and oppressed. He is saying that hope, joy, and purpose can be found! But the gospel he offers turns out to be no gospel at all; it is a false gospel that leaves an even bigger hole than the one it was intended to fill. What is his answer? Take responsibility for being; take control of your present and choose to move forward in the future. Do not blame others for your circumstances or depend on another for rescue, but choose to walk the fine line between the chaotic unknown and the orderly known world by pressing forth to craft your own meaning.\nThis, he claims, is what the individual soul longs for and is how we can lead to a collective flourishing—over against the atrocities of the 20th century (e.g. xxxv). The 12 rules he outlines all unpack this charge—\"take responsibility for your being”—from different angles. Instead of summarizing his rules, I think it will be more profitable to consider his agenda as a whole and why his gospel is no gospel at all.\n\nIf you have studied philosophy, you will quickly notice that Peterson is heavily influenced by the existentialist tradition mediated through Heidegger, finding himself very close to the “Christian” philosophers Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann. In Peterson’s brand of existentialism, the traditional questions of philosophy are collapsed into ethics, into the question of how should and do we live. Epistemology, the questions of truth and how we know it, and metaphysics, the question of standards for truth and the reality of experience, are collapsed into the central imperative of existentialism, “take responsibility for Being.” “Being,” capitalized by Peterson (following the tradition of Heidegger) refers to the “totality of human experience,” both individual (my experience) and corporate (our experience) (xxxi). How Peterson thinks “taking responsibility for Being” should be done is unpacked through the 12 rules explained in the book. The definition employed early in the book is helpful: “We must each adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world” (xxxiii).\n\nIn the tradition of the old liberal theologians (namely Adolf Harnack) and the existentialist Rudolf Bultmann, Peterson presents his philosophy of life in Christians terms, redefining doctrines of depravity, atonement, original sin, and faith in terms of existentialism (e.g. 55, 59, 189-90, 226). This brings us to the first problem of the book. Many Christians I have talked to see Peterson’s concern for Scripture and its centrality for western society as a refreshing breeze in modern thought. But It becomes clear early on (e.g. 43, 359) that Peterson’s interest in Scripture is not that of a Christian nor of a sort that is compatible with Christianity. Instead, Scripture is a deposit of ancient wisdom, insights spewed forth from the depths of Being itself (think of Being in the corporate sense above) (e.g. 104).\nThe wisdom Peterson finds in the Bible is conveniently his own existentialist Jungian (as in the psychological system of Carl Jung) philosophy (e.g. Rule 2). It is not only that he rejects the inspiration and authority of Scripture, but he rejects its ability to communicate clearly. Instead, the Scriptures are demythologized to discover the moral teaching that is being communicated by its myths (xxvii, 34-35). This brings us to the second major issue.\n\nChristians should be concerned with Peterson’s handling of Christian doctrine and Scripture, let alone his false Gospel. Yet not even the non-Christian will find a plausible gospel here. Instead, those who follow Peterson’s rules are bound to find themselves in deeper despair than that which drove them to Peterson in the first place.\nThroughout the book he takes the stance of an old man dispensing wisdom, a scholarly authority dispensing his knowledge. Yet unlike the old person speaking from life-long experience or the authority speaking hard-earned truth, Peterson’s book does not escape the category of opinion. That is, he never offers a credible reason why we should believe the philosophy he offers.\n\nThe nihilism to which this book responds emerged from a vacuum of truth and meaning; with god dead, as 20th century thought claimed, no objective standard was left for truth and meaning. It was quickly discovered that humanity was insufficient to the task of formulating their own meaning (and formulating your own truth is a contradiction in terms). Instead of returning the reader to an objective foundation, Peterson suggests that taking responsibility for being will produce its own meaning (199-201, 283).\nThe problem, of course, is that meaning is not something that can emerge of its own accord. Peterson suggests that meaning will emerge as you take responsibility for being, yet this hardly seems the natural order of things. We are motivated to do something because we see it to be meaningful. We set goals and achieve them when we are assured they have meaning; we do not find meaning by setting goals. Without transcendence, without a God who orders reality, authoritatively sets out good and bad, right and wrong, there can be no meaning. Meaning is intrinsically tied with morality, pursuing what is good and true, and eschatology, pursuing the proper end. Without a purposeful plan for history, a distinct direction and a standard by which to evaluate progress in that direction, their can be no meaning.\nBy leaving meaning and truth (157-159, 230) in the hands of the individual, Peterson never manages to offer a reasonable or satisfactory answer to the problem he is attempting to solve. If truth is the story you tell with your life (230), what foundation is there for the hundreds of moral evaluations he makes? What reason do we have to trust his advice, listen to his opinion, when there is no foundation for the claims he makes?\n\nPeterson offers some genuinely good advice and surely many people need to hear his call to take responsibility for life and do something with it (though I doubt those who need to hear this the most will bother reading the book). However, by giving no firm foundation for his advice, he ultimately sets the reader on the path to inevitable despair and disappointment. The advice may work for season, maybe two, but when some success is reached or when hardship comes, they will be confronted once again with meaninglessness. Like the rich and famous, they will discover at the end of their goals the same void from which they fled.\n\nThere is ultimately only one good news, and Peterson’s philosophy is not it. The good news is that Jesus Christ has acted to save us from the wrath of God not that we can save ourselves and society from hopelessness and despair. The good news is that Jesus Christ will one day return and bring an end to all pain and misery and bring justice to all the atrocities of our time and beyond; the good news is not that we will work together to forge a better future. The good news is that Jesus Christ redeems us, calls us, and commissions us to live for Him in this world, giving us meaning. He has revealed the truth, and only this truth will set us free. Believing in Jesus Christ is the only escape from Nihilism, not a vague hope in “the intrinsic goodness of being” and confidence in our own ability to craft truth and meaning.",
    "I want to thank Mr Peterson for writing this book.\nI may have found myself re-reading certain sentences or paragraphs I struggled to take in, and used my dictionary more regularly than in a game of scrabble as he uses some words I’ve never heard spoken but it was totally worth the read.\nI like him a lot (from what I’ve seen on YouTube and his words in this book) and wish him every success as he seems like he truly wants to help us all be better.\nThis is not a book to attempt at a fast pace. Take your time, digest what he’s trying to get across and you’ll get the most out of it.\n\nIt’s a bit like giving up smoking... you have to really want to give up to truly commit. I got to a point this year where I really wanted to make a change and this book offers a highly informed helping hand to set you on the right path.\n\nPrior to this I’d read The Chimp Paradox which I’d also recommend for those who are trying to sort themselves out.",
    "I couldn't finish this. I got as far as Rule 11 and thought to myself why waste more time. I'm some sort of media hermit obviously and hadn't heard of the author until a friend waxed lyrical about how he regularly 'beat' interviewers and 'opponents'. The style of writing may appeal to some but to me it was like syrup. As for the content, it was basic on psychology . Lobster behaviour is interesting to illuminate a tiny amount of human behaviour from a (taken for granted) evolutionary point of view, but in terms of offering an insight into human psyches (a very tiny insight would be the goal of humble thinkers) it fails to leave the ground. Among all the cloying rhetoric is the author's anger towards progressive politics which he dismisses in the usual way of libertarians - that is, without analysis or apparent knowledge. The star given here is in recognition that the text provides a small insight into the state of public consumption of shoddy, third-rate soi-disant intellectuals."

    "As mentioned many know and/or read the book, which increases the probability of being asked something quite related to its content. Personally, I was asked the same exact questions in quite a few companies without any modification. There is a variety of topics and algorithmic solutions provided in order to cope effectively and more confidently with similar problems.\n\nThat being said, the coding interviews might be a self-defeating process. Gayle writes about the sharp, passionate candidate with a 3.71 GPA, with an extensive contribution to open-source projects (and thus coding) struggling to solve/code, on the spot, a well-known problem that others knew. And he was rejected. The data, as she mentions, wasn't there based on her judgment and the rest of the committee.\n\nThe data is still there (GPA, years of experience, open-source contribution) but obviously are neglected or improportionately weighted, on the spot, in favor of a 30 min (?) process that an engineer/developer will never be called to perform in his job, and thus the interview probably has negligible predictability or weight. Developers or engineers will never solve or tackle a problem, on the spot, with do-or-die supervision. It is more likely to involve a time of refraining from answering, gathering info, analyzing the code or the problem in their workspace, and coming up for a presentation or discussion prepared. Struggling, that characterizes many devs in the interviews, and probably Gale, is more likely associated with lack of preparation or lack of availability in memory based on a difficult issue the candidate encounters for the first time, while another one might have checked it within the same week. And if it could have been the other way around, then we could probably agree that there is a factor of randomness.\n\nThe low predictability or significance of \"on the spot\" judgments during interviews has also been mentioned by decision-makers (Daniel Kahneman) while many of the judges use solely their intuition. This is also mentioned by Gayle \"After the interview, your interviewer will have a gut feeling which is translated to numeric score\".\n\nWhat is worse, it is often communicated, based on my experience, that the problem/puzzle is there to evaluate how your brain thinks/works, with no acknowledgement of the lack of credentials, qualifications and domain knowledge of the committee to justify such confident claims.\n\nWhat is more important, the expertise and skills throughout the years, which have a considerable weight for candidates to perform and add value practically have been overridden by, on the spot, coding of a puzzle.\nThe committee potentially is subject to the \"substitution bias\", they don't really answer the question \"Should we hire him and test him based on his past experience, skills, and knowledge\" but the \"Can he solve/code this puzzle, on the spot, although he will never really need to repeat such a process in his new job\".\n\nExpertise and experience in repeated tasks with similar parameters (utilizing a programming language for years, frameworks, infrastructure) produce highly calibrated individuals on the job duties [Judgment under uncertainty: Bias and Heuristics] and are not tested, in favor of an instant brainstorming of a problem.",
    "must have the excellent background knowledge to understand. not for beginning programmers",
    "Good book",
    "While this is a great resource, there's so much information, that yo can't just read it and think you're good. you have to study it. Practice the problems found ant the end of every chapters and often times find additional sources on the internet. If you're willing to put the work in, you'll get LOADs out! Good luck",
    "This is an excellent in-deep source of information definitely recommended to everybody who is preparing for the interview. If gives a lot of tips on the interview process with FAANG companies and not only along with questions and answers from the real interviews (I found several hard tasks I was asked on the interviews in the past). It also allows to rehash your knowledge of algorithms and programming and has different complexity levels.\nWhat i’d recommend to add is more complex Advanced SQL (ranking, case, CTE) and data mart design basics questions.\nBut in general this is a priceless book definitely recommended not only for the interview prep but also for shaping your coding skills!",
    "Very detailed and encyclopedic coverage of programming tasks. It would take months to work through them all. Not really a quick guide to interview questions, but more like a thorough book of programming exercises.",
    "It's true everyone's heard of this book. Everyone in my boot camp bought it, I don't know if anyone actually read it through because it's so dense (literally and figuratively). A lot my classmates and I ended up getting really great jobs but we all used resources online. There are great tutorials on Udemy, YouTube, fireship.io and they explain it in the language you want to use. And a lot of these people are actually fun to listen to. There's no point in learning java if youre going to code in python or js. So I don't really recommend this book, especially if you're beginner. Like whose idea was to start this off with BigO and data structures (which aren't even explained well, just tells you to use them).",
    "I’m 10 years out of college and needed to brush up on DSA for a senior engineer technical interview. I liked how the book was laid out and organized so I could quickly find the topics I needed to focus on and study. The book prepared me well and provided good tips for how to approach problems. I got the job!",
    "I’ve rated this as a four star as the book seems to be well written. I only got so far before I gave up.\nThe reason for this is : I graduated and was looking for developer jobs and thought this book would be great!\nPerhaps it is great for someone with a few years experience that’s looking for a senior developer role.\nAs a junior this was out with my skill set or knowledge l.\nThe book is well written don’t get me wrong and you will learn a lot from it but I think it would require sitting down and making this a study book.\nNo doubt I will go back to this in a few years when I have a far greater knowledge and can understand this",
    "Looking for a change in Job?\nWant to crack all the codes thrown towards you?\nNot good at the advanced techniques of coding?\nThen, This book is for you.\n\nP.S.: This is not for Beginners. You should be familiar with the basics first",
    "Pages from 107 to 118 missing, so no graphs and bit manipulation topics for me 🙂\nOther than that, some useful advices and approaches how to solve problems. But definitely it should not be seen as a single thing you need to do for interview preparation.

    "Spending $26.95 to pick Ray Dalio’s brain for over 16 hours listening to the audiobook appears fantastic value to me. The thought crossed my mind to offer Mr. Dalio a charity donation in his name if he gave me the opportunity to make it a two-way conversation over lunch. But that wouldn’t have been consistent with his (or my) Principles. Instead, I’m offering my radically truthful review for $0. The challenge for Mr. Dalio is whether reading this review will be time well spent. Ray, you do not know my ‘believability’ – and that is a key deficiency in your principles you might want to address, especially when applied to the next phase in your life. Let me expand.\n\nPrinciples details an organically grown set of rules to run a business. Ray shows how his principles have enabled him to build the world’s largest hedge fund and stipulates that anyone can build a great organization following his rules. His success speaks for itself - he is the first to point out that anyone should adopt their own principles. The common theme is a deeply rooted belief that running a business is similar to managing a professional sports team- taking this to an extreme, which Ray does, creates stimulating food for thought.\n\nRay’s definition of “principles” is not what many might expect. Principles go beyond a Rotarian Four-Way Test; they go beyond the Ten Commandments. Principles is more like a Harvard MBA class in waiting (he loves case studies, refers to them as case law), they are an assortment created by someone who, in his own assessment, is an engineer at heart. Engineers get things done, even if messy at first, trial and error is a virtue. I’m married to an engineer and have learned to appreciate this approach. In contrast, I’m a computer scientist. Computer scientists like to generalize problems even if the sample size is one; they like models and abstraction. The approaches are similar, yet distinct: engineers may get to market faster, but there’s a risk that things get too convoluted, too complicated once the complexity increases (you propose an app to wade through the ‘pile of principles’). The computer scientist might never make it beyond the modeling stage, too worried about that potential bug. My hunch is that without their benevolent despot, at some point, newly introduced principles (or old ones re-interpreted) will clog the machine. At that point it might be time to call on a computer scientist to help unclutter things. That said, who am I to criticize Ray’s principles? In fact, this isn’t meant as criticism, just a forecast. Any approach to managing a business will have potential pitfalls, being aware of those pitfalls will help stakeholders navigate them.\n\nTo appreciate Principles, a passion for investing is helpful, if only because of the industry lingo used. At first, I thought it’s a pity that this might limit his audience. But, no, it makes Principles authentic. Instead, I look forward to also reading books of other thought leaders passionate about their field with a completely different mindset.\n\nSince investments are the topic of discussion at various times, let me shout out a big thank you to Ray, as he sheds light on what I believe is one of the biggest misconceptions in the community, notably also amongst hedge fund managers. Many have heard hedge fund managers tend to look for trades that have little downside, but much upside. A lot of investors, notably hedge fund managers, take that too literally, as they pursue options strategies. Buying an option costs fairly little (the premium), but offers potential upside that may be much greater. The problem with options is that they have what’s called time decay, notably that your option may expire worthless. In an era of low volatility, lots of options expire worthless. Options may also be used as insurance; but that, too, can be costly. Don’t get me wrong: there are worthwhile options strategies, but they are not the holy grail of low risk / high reward. Principles does not go into detail of how options work, but has an explainer of diversification. It is generally understood that diversification is the one free lunch available on Wall Street. Ray points out the obvious, notably that stocks are highly correlated with one another, so investors should consider uncorrelated return streams. At Bridgewater, he says, they combine as many as 15 different return streams from different asset classes; I challenge any reader to name just a few, let alone use multiple in their actual investments. Importantly, he argues, the way one achieves high potential upside with limited downside is by combining uncorrelated return streams. That’s very different from buying options (an options strategy may or may not be part of these return streams, but that’s a subordinate issue) in hopes of striking gold. Yes, Ray discusses gold, too; get a copy of the book to learn more.\n\nBefore I go much further in reviewing Principles, it may be helpful to review Ray’s agenda in publishing the book, as it helps to understand what this book is and what it is not. When I heard Ray as a guest on public radio last week, the cynic in me flagged this must be a symptom of a market top. But I recalled he had also given a “TED Talk”, so I was curious enough to question my gut reaction, leading to my downloading and listening to the audiobook of Principles. Ray is straightforward about his agenda: he considers his principles part of his legacy, wants to pass on the institutional knowledge he has helped build. In publishing the book, he also wants to have bright talent consider working for Bridgewater, as his firm had received bad media coverage about cult-like culture that apparently hampered its recruiting efforts. Ray makes it clear that his firm is the exact opposite of a cult. I agree, but read and judge for yourself.\n\nWhile his book should be cherished by any aspiring entrepreneur, it is not squarely aimed at those running a small business. Sure, the book makes it clear that anyone following his principles can build a great organization, but at various sections in the book it becomes clear he is focused on running a large organization. I have no problem with that, but it helps to understand the context as to why he wrote the book.\n\nRay says successful entrepreneurs tend to be “shapers”, that is persons who can see the big picture, yet pay attention to detail (think Steve Jobs). His style should resonate well as what he profiles as the archetypical small business person: anyone running a small business has big dreams, yet takes care of the details. In fact, I can’t help but contemplate that maybe Ray is a small business person himself, of sorts. One who has managed to grow a big organization by using his principles for many management details – the “machine” as he calls it.\n\nThe context is relevant though, as everyone, including Ray, is hostage of his environment. Ray makes a convincing case that meritocracy is key to success; that is, decisions are best made based on believability-weighted decisions. He then goes to great lengths to explain the “machine” he has built to develop profiles of his staff. He has run his firm like a petri dish in a closed environment. He argues that, with limited time, it isn’t worthwhile, even potentially hazardous, to listen to unqualified opinions. That approach has worked for him as he has the resources to run his social experiment in-house. But is this the most efficient way? Is it most efficient to grow your talent, weed out a third that’s not up to the task, impose radical transparency and radical truthfulness on them, even if that’s not their nature? It may well be, but there’s a risk standards slip once the benevolent despot is out of the picture, no matter how big the pile of principles is.\n\nWhile I have never called it such, I have applied radical transparency to running my investment business. Unlike most in the industry, for the past fifteen years, I have shared my views and positions with the general public. What do I get in return? Feedback. We have learned to filter that feedback into our idea generation engine, and to stress test our hypotheses. I have most appreciated that as I could not have possibly obtained that feedback with the limited resources I have in managing my comparatively small team. Ray may have brilliant experts in-house, but he is missing out on the brilliance out there. He scoffs at the public’s input in his book; after all, the mob does not have your optimal investment performance in mind. I beg to differ: just as one can develop models to rate the believability of your team, you can develop models to rate the believability of the public or any subset of the public, including those of specific strangers. Take Twitter as the simplest example: everyone can broadcast anything on Twitter, but you can curate who you want to listen to. Folks offer their analysis for free, you might as well harvest the value, separating quality from noise.\n\nLike many asset managers, we get visits by strategists of major financial institutions. They provide thoughtful insight. But the so-called strategist at major institutions are not allowed to put their money where their mouth is. While I appreciate their input, it is very different from that of an employee who has his or her own sets of conflicts; and that is yet again very different from the feedback provided by a complete stranger. And while many investment professionals ridicule retail investors, I have learned to appreciate them. We have some public products, so I can see the flows; there are some pretty smart cookies amongst retail investors.\n\nWhat I’m getting at is that Bridgewater – to just name Ray’s firm as an example – may at some point need to turn outward. And with that, I don’t mean it has to be unleashing Big Data indiscriminately (Ray provides criticism I agree with). But I believe the successful machine of the future may well include an assessment of the public. Are the principles flexible enough, can they evolve?\n\nI’m not telling you anything you don’t know already, as it is increasingly pervasive in a variety of industries, most notably online advertising. In my humble opinion, it will be crucial for Ray’s next ambition: to help policy makers navigate tough decisions. You are not going to get members of Congress to adhere to the rigors of your meritocracy, yet it would be a pity to just disregard what you have created. So build a system that’s open. Build the machine that helps policy makers make the right decision based on merits. Incidentally, a machine that helps policy makers by sourcing input from the public, amongst others, could also be of use to Bridgewater.\n\nOne more note on your big-business-mindset, Ray: you argue that a janitor should be an in-house employee, as it is more cost effective as long as the person is full-time. Can it be that you are biased? Can it be that you love building machines so much, so that you in-source the janitor simply to prove your point? Good for you. And, clearly, it was not your goal to write the how-to-book for the smalltime entrepreneur. For anyone but big business, I allege that outsourcing non-core functions can be most effective. Indeed, in today’s world, it is so much easier to start a business because you can outsource so much. The culture in a janitorial firm is different from that in an investment firm; I would also think the typical employee on the investment side at Bridgewater is going to be more open to meritocracy than your janitorial division.\n\nIf you have read my ‘review’ all the way to this point, let me provide a business idea for the new phase in your life, if you haven’t done it already: hold periodic auctions for a charitable cause – open to the public - for discussions over lunch. Especially in the aftermath of the publicity you generate in promoting your book, you should be able to raise a fair amount to satiate hungry minds that want to discuss Principles with you.\n\nFinally, one criticism: get off your butt, start doing exercise and don’t merely talk about the 2nd order benefits. Your family will have you around longer if you invest in your physical wellbeing.\n\nRay: if you’d like me to expand on the above or help in building that open machine, give me a call.",
    "This book was fantastic and extremely organized. The author starts the book by giving the reader a background on who he is and how he arrived at the principles that were outlined. This part of the book is good for anyone that's not familiar with the author's backstory. It was somewhat astounding to learn that Mr. Dalio was literally broke in 1982 and has come-back to build a 150 billion dollar hedge fund.\n\nIn the second part of the book, the author gets into the stuff that's incredibly important, but difficult to implement. In short, he provides a roadmap and tools (via algorithmic means) to accomplish anything you want in life. There's a ton of substance, definition, & practicality on how to action your objectives. He has a five-step process to achieve what you want out of life, and it couldn't be more understandable and reasonable. The tricky part for most people (in my humble opinion) is finding a goal or objective that they can focus and remain passionate about for an extended period. If that's not your problem, then Mr. Dalio's advice in the second part of the book is significantly profound.\n\nIn the third section of the book, the author teaches you how to build the mastermind group/organization that's going to achieve the goals/mission you outlined in the second part of the book. The knowledge and thought that went into these 300 pages of the book are quite impressive. In short, the reader needs to get the culture right, get the people right, and then build and evolve the protocols that run the organization at a fundamental level. There's so much granularity behind those core concepts that it'll keep you busy trying to absorb everything.\n\nIn my humble opinion, MBA programs should be designing management courses around the information contained in this book. It's extremely thorough, practical, and organized.\n\nNegatives. The book is a long read. If you're looking for something that's quick and easy, you're in the wrong place. The book is so organized (which I personally liked) that some might find it too programmatic. If you're looking for surprises and adventurous stories with your learning, you won't get that in the last two parts of the book. Dalio is all business.\n\nIn general, I'm so impressed the author took the time and effort to teach the world everything he has learned. You can tell he truly wants to help others be successful. The book has taught me the importance of trying to understand the fundamental building blocks of my own life. I now have an appreciation for trying to understand how things work and how I can model success habits around those principles. I've started to list my own principles, but it's hard identifying unique ideas beyond those found in the book (because it's so thorough). But the important part is that I'm aware of developing my own list and co-opting or creating new principles. This book has had a profound impact on me - it's definitely worth more than 5 stars.",
    "I connected instantly with ray because i too also fell in love with trading the markets at a young age and i also have a few other things in common with the author. All i have to say is that this book is packed with value, and i truly feel that ray dalio wrote this book (and the app that compliments the book) with the main intention of helping others. This isnt a self help book lol, id say more of a subjective instruction manual. This book lays out very helpful principles that can be applied in well..life and work…..he wrote these principles out easy enough for you to get the main idea, it is up to you to be creative enough to dissect the information given to you and apply it to your own circumstances.. all principles make sound logical sense, they are fairly applicable to any type of work or life goal, and some of those principles id say should be common sense but as we all know, common sense is not common, i learned some very crucial things just from the first 50 pages. such simple things that i had failed to realize about how i learn and think and do that if i had realized earlier i would be alot further along than i am now. the rest of the book gives even more value-able and crucial lessons and principles right up to the last page …read the book, think deeper than the words given, under stand the meaning of the principles and how the core concept of each principle applies to you as an individual, they are easy to apply to your thought processes….i highly recommend this book. If you cant focus enough to understand and internalize the principles go get some adderall prescribed or download the app he made, it has pictures and cartoons for you!… if you are into economics and financial markets i also recommend his other book. Plus they both look cool :)",
    "The book, physically, is very nicely bound and produced. It's print is lovely, black and red ink, and is organised into three parts. It's essentially a huge bullet-pointed document with one or two paragraphs under each sub-point. There are black and red ribbons to mark pages, which I've always liked in books.\n\nIt's an unusual book. I find myself swinging between enjoying Ray's wisdom and feeling like I need to take it all with a huge pinch of salt because of the massive amount of survivorship, hindsight and outcome bias in play.\n\nThe book is also a contradiction, since it is largely about open-minded and different points of view and yet its entirely Ray's unchallenged points of view. I'm a software engineer and I remember once reading a programming principles book where maybe five programmers all chimed in with their own opinions and challenges on the assertions in the book, which was really cool.\n\nMaybe another billionaire will say there's a case for close-mindedness, focus and shutting out opinion that will lead to analysis paralysis. Maybe there are books by leading psychologists that have devoted years to a topic that would be better to read, such as Thinking Fast and Slow. For older or more voracious or aspirational business, management or \"self improvement\" book readers, much of Ray's thinking will simply rhyme with what you may already believe.\n\nIt's probably wishful thinking to expect by reading a huge list of advice you'll magically be reprogrammed and have established a set of good thought patterns, esp. if you're trying to improve in isolation; you're not surrounded by people mirroring and modelling good practice. Though I rarely found myself disagreeing with anything Ray writes. There's a lot in the book to take in and I don't know how much will stick.\n\nThe biggest thing for me, and I say this as a \"fan\" of Ray, is that I struggle with the reviews of his company on Glassdoor and the _reality_ of people working under his principles vs. other companies that highly-successful while having much higher ratings and are anecdotally nicer places to work, such as Salesforce.\n\nWhen other companies can achieve so much and foster happy, purposeful, creative and fulfilled people by taking a different approach, you have to ask whether his principles have really led to better lives, better outcomes for his employees or whether Ray conflates how well he's done with achieving his life goals with how well everyone else is doing?",
    "After reading the book I am left feeling that Ray is a brilliant business man, just like Jobs and other visionaries, but also, just like Jobs, Ray is a very dangerous person because he doesn't understand how relationships work. In essence, he tries to put on an ethical mask by saying that relationships are important to him, but in reality he is an excellent manipulator. He comes up with strategies and have spent countless hours to figure out people, not because he loves them, wants to help them, but because he was fed up with people and wanted to understand the \"social code\".\n\nI think he does a great job at business, but really he should delete all the chapters about life principles and let people who are better than him at these topics lead the way. I expected a business oriented book, but in the end it felt like his redemtion story that he needed to write so all the people he hurt can understand why he hurt them and how it was their fault.\n\nRay reminds me of Gordon Geko in the new Wall Street film where he says he cares about family, but then has no awarness how to actually do it.",
    "Often we read books about Steve Jobs and Elon Musk written by other people which tries to understand how these guys function. The views are still third party.\nRay Dalio, on the other hand, wrote a book on his way of dealing with the world. For the first time ever you can see through a brain of a billionaire. He doesn't only shares his own set of principles, he tells you how to build your own set of principles by embracing your reality and your world. This book is insanely rational and analytical and teaches you how to look at everything related to you objectively.\n\nThis book can help you become a more evolved human being at a faster rate!",
    "The book is very inspiring in terms of establishing guiding principles in life and work. Unfortunately I think Ray and many readers think that the principles are valid for everyone as they are. Ray Dalio and his hedge fund is in a very unique position in terms of decision making process, recruitment and how they work. This is definitely not applicable for everyone. Use the book as inspiration to create your own principles from scratch but don't use his as a starting point.",
    "A very interesting read and insight into the mind of the creator of the most successful hedgefund known to man.\nI wish it would elaborate more on what role meditation had in his life...though I suppose there are plenty of interviews you can watch on that if you are interested. Though the first part was interesting, covering his personal life, what the majority of people bought this book for, I imagine, are his work principles, and the book delivers. The main idea is essentially to treat everything like a machine or algorithm. When you have set up different algorithms for different types of situations you can carry out decisions more quickly with less bias.\nNow I am looking forward to his next book that will cover his economic knowledge, I can't wait.\nIf your mind is full of wonder and you always look for ways of improving yourself, this books is for you."

    "I usually do not like reading, but I finished reading this book in three days, which is my fastest time I ever red any books.\n\nThe stories in the book of people who have manage to transform their family by following Dave’s total money make over plan is truly inspiring.\n\nAs a result of reading this book, I have decided to take action. I am ready to take control over my finances.\n\nThank you Dave for such an amazing book!",

    "There’s no getting around it. This works, and it doesn’t matter your beliefs or ideals. The baby steps make getting out of debt and building wealth possible. Andy it’s given me hope to dig out of this whole I’m in for the first time ever!",

    "Great couples financial book",
    "Great book all around!",
    "I've always been interested in my finances and my husband and I jointly manage our family's finances so we both know what's going on. A friend at church was talking about Dave Ramsey and I had never heard of him before so I decided to look him up and see what kinds of books he wrote. I found this book to be a popular choice of his and I didn't know how much of it would interest me so I ended up borrowing it from the library initially. I enjoyed his writing and found the information to be helpful so I decided to purchase my own copy to reference at home.\n\nThe Total Money Makeover is a personal finance book written by Dave Ramsey. Ramsey is a financial expert as well as a Christian who has had his own money troubles in the past. He's overcome them and learned from his mistakes so he's passed along his wisdom in these pages. There are also many stories of people who have been in a tough spot financially who used this book to get themselves out of debt. This book is 237 pages long, contains 13 chapters, worksheets and a full index.\n\nI found this book to be helpful and I really enjoyed reading it! Dave Ramsey writes in a no-nonsense fashion and if he says something is stupid or a bad idea, he will say exactly that. He doesn't beat around the bush. He provides step-by-step information on getting yourself out of debt and what to do if you have a crisis while you are working on getting yourself out of debt (he also refers to Murphy's Law quite a bit so something will always happen). I like how he tells us what types of companies, funds, etc to avoid and what ones are good ones. Even though he knows a lot about investments, he doesn't provide extensive investment information in this book but he does give some information on what types of funds he thinks are best based on trends.\n\nI enjoyed this book so much that I told my sister about it and she said she wanted to read it too so I bought one for her and one for myself. I've told others about the book and I think it is helpful, no matter what your financial situation is. Some parts of the book didn't apply to us but I found the second half of it to be especially informative which is why I decided to buy a copy. Unless you already have millions of dollars in the bank and have all of your finances under control (retirement, investments, kids' college education, etc.), I think you'll find the information in this book to be useful.\n\nIf you have a lot of credit card debt and loans and want to get your finances under control, I highly recommend this book. Even if you don't have a lot of debt but you want to find a smarter way prepare for your kids' college education, this is a great book to read. It's very informative and you can also borrow a copy from a friend or the library first before you buy your own. I'm glad I bought it because the small investment in this book has caused us to take a closer look at our finances and see what we can do better. Overall, I feel it's worth the money and time to buy and read this book so you have a financially-fit future!",
    "I am a UK reader and have to say that though the book is very American in the discussion of products that it recommends the principles are sound and help greatly.\nThe techniques are easy to pick up and impliment. The stories within the book give some motivation though I had a tendancy to glaze over them as I was not there for the stories but was there mainly for the tips and tricks.\nWould reccommend for anyone looking to become debt free",
    "As a UK based reader, I felt some of the concepts which Dave talks about are primarily focused on a US based audience; however, I think the book does give the right type of philiosophy, which is transferable to any global reader. The baby-steps Dave outlines are a good roadmap to follow and really just makes you think about money in a different way.\n\nOne dislike about the book is that there is a lot of 'filler' in by there are testimonial stories from people who have had a total money makeover. I felt this may have been done to give the reader reassurance they are not alone; however, I do think it acts as a way of diluting down the real content of the book.\n\nDave does talk about Financial Peace and I think this book probably covers a lot of the content covered in that book. If you haven't heard of Dave Ramsey in the UK, he's kind of the US equivalent to Martin Lewis. I like Dave's 'no frills' approach and the book isn't designed as a shortcut to wealth. The fastest way to wealth is to avoid debt like the plague, and I think Dave really addresses this.\n\nIf you're wanting to improve your basic financial approach and want to think of money in a different way, then this book is for you, but do be prepared to do some homework if you're a non-US reader to find equivalency to some of the concepts I.E. pensions etc. in your home country.\n\nALWAYS speak to a good financial advisor too! :)",
    "I'm sure this book may be useful to someone who is riddled with debt (and living in America) but if you have picked up this book for a general guide on finance then you are in the wrong place.\n\nDave takes so long to get to the point in this book, the first 112 pages are him telling you how great his plan for getting out of debt is, sprinkled in are lots of testimonials from people who also claim his plan is great.\n\nThe actual content of this book could fit on the front cover, let me save you some time and the cost of the book: step 1, save a thousand pounds as a backup, 2 pay off your debts from smallest to biggest, 3 don't buy anything on credit, 4 save money for retirement. Wow, life changed...\n\nUnless you are deeply in debt and living in the USA do not waste your precious time or money on this leaflet. Also if you are in the UK and dislike all the awful American over-positive mumbo jumbo you may feel sick reading this.\n\nWell done to the guy for getting some people out of debt but man just get to the point!!",
    "In the UK, we have Martin Lewis who only seems to talk about saving money. However, there is no one who tells you how you can win with money. Through the 7 steps David Ramsey advocates, any household can make a financial difference in their lives. I am on the up. I have taken his advice to heart and will update this review once completed. I am confident that it will work. Change your attitude and watch your financial state improve.",
    "This book totally changed my perception of managing my money and has changed my life. I know I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for reading this book. If you want to start saving and get rid of debt, this is the book you NEED to read"

    "We can change our life with careful attention to design: how we use our time, our talents and resources. Structure need not be totally determined by work and habits formed in our former way of life.",
    "there are a bunch of youtube videos from the authors, you may wanna check them out",
    "This book is a good introduction to applying design thinking to life planning, with an emphasis on careers. The content below includes my interpretation of the book's chapters and key ideas. It is my intent that the review kindles your interest and spurs you on to buy the book.\n\nChapter 1. Start Where You Are\nThe authors advise readers to accept what you can't change, avoiding so-called \"gravity problems,\" which, by their very nature, cannot be changed.\n\nChapter 2. Building a Compass\nThis chapter discusses one's Workview (the reason one works) and Lifeview (areas that give life meaning), and encourage readers to align the two to form a Life Compass.\n\nChapter 3. Wayfinding\nThe book defines Wayfinding as figuring out where to go when the destination is not known. The authors emphasize engagement and energy in finding one's way in work and in life.\n\nChapter 4. Getting Unstuck\nIn this chapter, the book reviews the use of Mind Maps to generate new ideas.\n\nChapter 5. Design Your Lives\nThe book encourages readers to develop (at least) 3 potential \"Lives\" and assess them.\n\nChapter 6. Prototyping\nIn this chapter, the authors encourage testing the potential lives through informational interviews and other techniques to try out the lives in a non-committal way.\n\nChapter 7. How Not to Get a Job\nChapter 8. Designing Your Dream Job\nChapters 7 and 8 were disappointing, offering obvious advice such as, \"pursue as many job offers as you can,\" and showed little knowledge or awareness of the today's job search process.\n\nChapter 9. Choosing Happiness\nThe chapter encourages people to embracing the choices we make, rather than agonizing over them. It especially recommends paying attention to the Basal Ganglia (the ancient base brain) to monitor personal feelings toward potential choices.\n\nChapter 10. Failure Immunity\nThe authors recommend learning from one's mistakes, to become \"immune\" to the sadness of failure.\n\nChapter 11. Building a Team\nHere, the authors encourage the reader to engage others toward one's life path.\n\nOverall, I found the book interesting with useful elements.\nThe book would be improved by removing chapters 7 and 8, and in their place, adding more examples of people going through life designs and the challenges facing them, especially those wishing to change careers. Recommended for people interested in applying design thinking toward career development.",

You have to do the exercises. Do them, buy it now. Don't waste any more of your time squandering our life away being miserable. Figure out what you like and dislike about your life, you probably think that you know already...but you don't. You can figure this stuff out, get the book go go go! Don't spend tons of money, time and energy trying to come up with a perfect life plan, you will drive yourself crazy like I did until I read this book at the ripe age of 38.",
    "I liked the ideas of developing healthy spiritual practices in one's life and performing informational interviews to find one's perfect job. Both of these things worked for me in the past.\nI did not like the idea of creating three fictional lives for myself so much. It was not clear to me just how much realness these should have.",
    " “there are lots of powerful voices in the world, & lots of powerful voices in our heads, all telling us what to do or who to be.”\n\nAt some point, we all wake up to the live we’ve lived by default. Some have that awakening at 20, others at 80. Whenever it happens—we have a choice: Do we continue to live what our default & habits have brought us to? Or do we choose to do & be different.\n\nAnd it may not be a singular awakening, or a “Harajuku Moment” as Chad Fowler calls it. It could be several pivotal or teachable moments. Birthdays, new years, significant milestone events. There are these moments that challenge not only who we are, but how we define our place in the world.\n\nDefinition can come from default, or design.\n\nThat’s what this book covers. It brings a Stanford d.school approach, to lifestyle design. It’s a total package approach. I especially like the dysfunctional beliefs & reframes, sprinkled throughout the book.\n\nTaking this to the end—the authors want you to truly get all your ideas of life & work out of your head, and onto paper. Craft your workview & life view, then take a log of how much your current life measures up.\n\nComparing that log, you start finding places where you can expand your views into action. Into your practice. And over time, you can recast yourself into someone new.\n\nSimple, not easy.\n\nIt’s easy to agonize about being wrong. It’s easy to decide to let design happen on it’s own. But then months & years pass—and we lose the initiative on what our design could have been.\n\nThis book isn’t an indictment or judgment. It’s supportive & empathetic. The authors want you to use all their tools, & enjoy the process of lifestyle design. Enjoy the process, you’ll enjoy & own more of what the results could be.\n\nYou have to make space for joy, to make sure you find it.",
    "Great process for rethinking your life. Great systematic approach and tools to use. Easy to read and fun stories. Highly recommend.",
    "Overrated and disappointing. Perhaps needs something more apt for the UK but even then I’m not too sure. It’s pribably good for a teen. Well branded and great on line support. If you see someone who has NEVER self-reflected then this would be a dream so I’m perhaps my expectations were too high. So may regift it.",
    "Durch eine Youtuberin wurde ich auf das Buch aufmerksam (Cheyenne Barton), und die Leseprobe überzeugte ebenfalls. Doch im Verlauf des Lesens stellte sich heraus, dass der Titel des Buches leider recht irreführend ist. Zwischendurch ging es gut voran, und ich konnte den Übungen auch einiges abgewinnen. Aber ca. ab dem 1. Drittel des Buches ging es nicht mehr um das Leben, das designt werden sollte, sondern nur noch um die Arbeit. Das ist an sich nicht schlimm, und bestimmt wird das auch einige Leser ansprechen, die sich mit dieser Thematik auseinandersetzen wollen. Aber wenn man sich \"Designing your life\" als Titel vornimmt, dann sollte es auch um die verschiedenen Lebensbereiche gehen, nicht nur um einen einzigen.\nWer also auf der Suche nach Möglichkeiten ist, seine Sicht auf die Arbeit zu verändern oder allgemein eine andere Richtung sucht, die er mit seiner Arbeit einschlagen kann, ist bei diesem Buch genau richtig. Alle, die mehr als nur diesen Bereich verändern wollen, würden hier leider - wie ich- enttäuscht werden.",
    "Personally, expected more elaborated and interesting techniques. Found the book too simplistic and expected more value, that honestly, I couldn't find, but maybe someone will. Just for a person like me that thinks a lot about life and that is looking for answers in other places as well, the book can feel quite repetitive and without added value.",
    "Introspección y ejercicios útiles. Me ayudó a darme cuenta que hacerlo sola no me ha llevado lejos, ha sido un proceso agotador y costoso; tengo a mi alrededor un “equipo” y mentores que me ayudan en el proceso de diseñar “mi mejor vida” y me abro al universo de posibilidades y nuevas aventuras y conocimientos que el tratar con nuevas personas vinculadas a lo que me interesa, me permite el proceso que este libro propone.",
    "Having came out of a long unhappy life and therapy. I found this book. The exercises here can really make changes in your life. The way they teach you to reframe your mindset from dysfunctional beliefs to practical ones helped me a lot. I recommend this book to everyone."

    "I’ve found one simple task to end my overactive braincells from thinking yet it’s not easy. It’s not easy to go to a non-thinking state and stay there but I’d say it’s totally worth it. This book gave me a lot of insights about myself and about the world we live in. I resonated with the author when he shared that he was in his darkest hour that he found the light. I’ve been searching for happiness everywhere not knowing that I can only find it within me. This book has helped me to rediscover my passion is and it is learning and sharing what I’ve learned to the world. This is one of the self help books that actually makes sense! Hats off to the author!",
    "If you are trying to find a way out of the constant cloud that weighs your mind/body down from everyday life, this book will help you discover that. Looking for another step in my own journey to continue improving myself, the words from Joseph truly hit home. We are victims are of own thinking and society feeds this condition. The ability to break away from this “thinking” is like a superhuman trait. It’s unbelievable how the book, broken down so easily into small chapters to digest every part contributes to the absorption of the information which you can apply as you finish read. Very rarely does this happen with other books. I’m so glad I stumbled upon this gem. It has truly changed my perception on life and the “thinking” that used to be part of it.",
    "This book has changed my life in such a positive way. I am one of those over thinkers that over analyze literally everything and it is so exhausting that I had so many sleepless nights through out the years. This book will help you become more aware of how your thinking is causing you so much suffering that you will make it habit to better manage your thinking and allowing you to truly feel and be part of your present - the now vs the future. I already bought several for my close friends and family members to read. Thank you Joseph.",
    "My thoughts spin out of control, catastrophizing the latest fear. I am sobbing and in the depths of yet another anxiety loop almost to the point of a panic attack. I can barely breathe, much less speak as my husband sits before me with worry creasing his brow. He begs me to tell him what is going on, but I can’t get the words out. It had been days that the clutches of something bigger than me, heavier, toxic had a hold on me. It was more than I could manage alone. Not only was I suffering, but those closest to me were suffering because of me as well. As he leaves the room without answers, I cry out, “God please! Please help me heal myself, send me whatever I need to heal, I am desperate God, I do not want to do this ever again!” Within a couple days, if not the very next day, I receive an email from Joseph Ngyuen (how I got on his email list, I may never know) about a book coming out the next day called “Don’t Believe Everything You Think”. I was intrigued but also dismissed it because it just seemed like the latest gimmicky self help book that was sure to offer nothing more than what I’d already read in the countless books that lined my shelves. I got another email the following day announcing its release. It was only $.99, what did I have to lose? No excuses. I bought the book, the digital version, and began to read immediately. Within just a few minutes of reading, I had the epiphany that would change my life. I realized that the narrative thinking was the cause of ALL my suffering, everyone’s in fact. I knew that I had been torturing myself thru these ruminating thoughts all these years, but I never really put together that I could control the narrative. I had to take back my power. I may be powerless to the thoughts that pop into my mind, but I have complete control on the narrative I play out about them. I can either choose to think about the thoughts, or I can just let them come and go without adding a story to them. Ever since that day I have applied this, refusing to create a narrative around the thoughts that pop into my head. I have experienced more peace and joy than anytime I can remember. Literally nothing is bringing me down (and that’s not for lack of circumstances). If I start to realize I’m feeling upset, I immediately recognize that it’s my thoughts making me upset. A situation or event is just what it is, I am the one creating the meaning around it. If the meaning I am creating is causing me to feel bad I need to stop and examine the story I am telling myself. Once I do this I decide to do something about it or let it go, either way I stop the story. Once the story stops, the suffering dissipates and I am free to go about my day unencumbered. Praise the Lord for sending me this gift! And thanks to Mr. Ngyuen for writing it and providing it to the world. Everyone should read this book.",
    "Thank you so much to the author for sharing your knowing with the world and helping other discover the truth!!! I am so thankful for the quotes before each chapter begins and the little stories that will stick with me forever! As soon as the thinking turns on I remember the stories told in the book and it’s sooo helpful! For instance the boat during meditation that’s me!!!! Thank you so so much for this life changing book! Your purpose was to put this out ! I listen to Abraham almost daily so I am already aware but it’s like we receive so differently from different people and it hits us different every time it’s through a different person! So thank you and everyone buy buy buy!",
    "This is a book I wish I was introduced to a long time ago. I have suffered with racing thoughts for a few years and it has caused me a great deal of mental frustration. I am so thankful for coming across this book. It has given me some great concepts to follow and for me to be able to live the life I knew i was capable of living, one that is full of peace, love, and joy. I think this book can apply to anyone and is a great guide to end the suffering that is within us. I cannot thank you enough Joseph.",
    "Really helpful to ready this perspective and do the micro exercises that it suggests. We can all use this book to be more present, lean forward into our intuition, and enjoy a new way of approaching life. Bought several copies to share with friends",
    "This is a really good book..It is worthy of reading more than once..The author is very pragmatic in his approach to though vs thing and the root of our problem..The book clears up things like engaging a though vs adding energy to it..Being present vs being in your thoughts...It is worth a read or two.",
    "I highly recommend this book. I have been on the awakening journey for many years, and this book served me very well as a reminder to be present and not overthink. Yes, the ideas in the book of controlling your thoughts and being present are not new, they have existed ever since humans did. However, what is unique about this book is the author, he belongs to the current springing generation and structured his book in a way that would be perfectly digested by his fellow humans from the same generation. I think he is a beautiful representation of the new generation, people his age. Not everyone from this generation would understand Eckhart Tolle, Michael Singer, and Alan Watts. Joseph simplified it, and that is what this new generation needs, something simple and short in this fast-paced era. Thanks Joe!",
    "I’m a great believer in not throwing the baby out with the bath water… But there’s an awful lot of water in this.\n\nAnd the one tenet the author proposes that really gets my goat is that if you’re not experiencing your new, hoped-for state of bliss, joy and love (and, by extension, financial security), maybe it’s because you’re just not _believing_ hard enough… This, my friends, is the basis of so much cod philosophy and psychology and it makes me angry!\n\nThere are a few interesting ideas in there, largely to do with how over-thinking can get in your own way, some thought-provoking quotations of the kind that daily flood our insta-feeds and the notion of goals being fuelled by inspiration or desperation, but those of you who are allergic to the kind of ‘woo-woo’ found in volumes like The Secret will, like me, come out in a rash.\n\nOverall: meh. There are so many fantastic self-help and psychology books out there, and this really is a rather shallow contribution to the oeuvre.",
    "This is my first ever Amazon review but this book has had such an immediate positive effect on me that I feel I should.\nI was was stuck in months long cycle of negativity. So much so it consumed me. I knew I had to do something, speak to a doctor, seek therapy.... something. Then I read this book. It is very simple, not rocket science but a series of lightbulb moments. That something I was searching for, that help I needed to break free, was in this book.\nLiterally over night, that cloud of negativity has lifted.",
    "Honestly couldn't put it down made me think about life in a whole new light everything feels a bit brighter, dont get me wrong its not gonna fix all your problems no book is magic unfortunately, but its definitely helps you look at life differently, first few pages are a bit of a confusing intro but once you get into it, it starts to become more clear 😉 one I think I will find my self repeatedly reading and recommending in the future.\ndont overthink the purchase you won't regret it follow your intuition :)",
    "I tend to be an overthinker and this book has given practical ways to minimise this. Everything was straight to the point and made a lot of sense."

    "\"THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG\" by David J. Schwartz\n\nThis is my second-time reading this book (first time being in 1999, shortly after I joined the Amway biz\nand shortly before I joined the Air Force), and after these years I still find it to be one of the best self-help books I've ever read. True enough, a lot of the material that Dr. Schwartz teaches within is seemingly common sense that should be boneheadedly obvious....yet in this day & age, common sense really ain't so common, and it's all to easy to lose track of the principles & power of positive thinking when we're surrounded by so much toxic negativity in the world\n\nRANDOM STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS (and noteworthy passages):\n\n--p. 2: \"There is magic in thinking big. 'If Thinking Big accomplishes so much, why doesn’t everyone think that way?' I’ve been asked that question many times. Here, I believe, is the answer. All of us, more than we recognize, are products of the thinking around us. And much of this thinking is little, not big. All around you is an environment that is trying to tug you, trying to pull you down Second Class Street.\" Hear, hear! Negative Nancys, Dream Killers, Debbie Downers, and Oxygen Thieves! Or as Gabe Suarez terms 'em, \"Rats, Shoemakers, and Lizards.\"\n\n--p. 3: \"...there is at least 50 times as much competition for jobs on Second Class Street as for jobs on First Class Avenue. First Class Avenue, U.S.A., is a short, uncrowded street.\" A First Class travel junkie like me takes heart in this!\n\n\"....minds like Milton, who in Paradise Lost wrote, 'The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven.'\" I've witnessed this myself repeatedly, in school, the military, law enforcement, and contracting alike.\n\n--p. 4: \"Start out with this thought of the great philosopher Disraeli: 'Life is too short to be little.'\" Ah, if only the late great USC Professor and leadership guru Warren Bennis (G-d rest his soul and Fight On Forever) were still around to discuss that particular quote!\n\n--p. 12: \"Currently, there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built.\" And yes, Dr. Schwartz (may you Rest In Peace), the Chunnel has long since become a reality.\n\n--p. 37: \"We often hear that knowledge is power. But this statement is only a half-truth. Knowledge is only potential power. Knowledge is power only when put to use—and then only when the use made of it is constructive.\"\n\n\"Einstein taught us a big lesson. He felt it was more important to use your mind to think than to use it as a warehouse for facts.\" [author's original emphasis]\n\n--p. 39: \"Ask yourself, 'Am I using my mental ability to make history, or am I using it merely to record history made by others?'\" Wow, powerful stuff right there!!\n\n--p. 50: \"Jot that down in your success rule book right now. Action cures fear.\" [author's original emphasis]\n\n--p. 131: \"Pay twice as much and buy half as many.\" (Regarding wardrobe)\n\n--p. 154: \"Let’s face it. Some folks, being jealous, want to make you feel embarrassed because you want to move upward.....It happens in the military service when a clique of negative-minded individuals poke fun at and try to humiliate the young soldier who wants to go to officers’ school.....You’ve seen it happen time and again in high schools when a group of lunkheads deride a classmate who has the good sense to make the most of his educational opportunities and come out with high grades. Sometimes—and all too sadly often—the bright student is jeered at until he reaches the conclusion that it isn’t smart to be intelligent.\" I can relate from personal experience!\n\n--p. 165: \"Go first class in everything you do. You can’t afford to go any other way.\" Life's too short to live it as a cheapo!\n\n--p. 182: \"People like to be called by name. It gives everyone a boost to be addressed by name. Two special things you must remember. Pronounce the name correctly, and spell it correctly. If you mispronounce or misspell someone’s name, that person feels that you feel he is unimportant.\" (Similar to what Dale Carnegie teaches in \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\")",
    "Very well written with a great message!",
    "Books on personal development, or the so-called ‘self’-help genre, have been around for so long, there is no doubt about that. There is a plethora of such books, which promise to help a person overcome the tough situations in life and sail through smoothly. Especially in our modern times, where publishing a book has become as easy as ordering a product online, there is a rise in the number of authors who promise to improve your life by offering some quick-fix solutions for your troubles. But there are very few authors who write books that leave a lasting impact, without merely indulging in flowery language and empty platitudes. 'The Magic of Thinking Big' is a book of the first kind.\n\nMake no mistakes about it, all of us started our lives by dreaming big. We had high ambitions, we dreamt big and hoped big. But sooner than later the 'reality' gave us a wake-up call and the world around made us shrink our dreams and thoughts. Few of us, if ever, arrived at our last day with all our dreams fulfilled and all our hopes intact. Life shakes us all up and shatters our dreams. But some of us march on, tough as nails in the face of struggles. What separates such victors from the vanquished is their thought process. When Life throws you a challenge, one can simply wilt down and wither away or one can simply toughen oneself up and tear apart the challenges. And, one's self-belief plays the most crucial role in how one overcomes the challenges.\n\nIn this book, Dr.David Schwartz elaborates on the ageless principle of 'you become what you think'. What is so refreshing about this book is the very practical approach to the problems and the offering of subtle solutions. This book does not ask you to write some self-assuring line for 100 times daily. This book does not ask you to stare at yourself in a mirror - except on one rare occasion - and repeat some 'magical phrase' so many times to encourage yourself. All this book asks you is to think and to think BIG.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this book is, this is quite comprehensive. Whether you are suffering from self-imposed inferiority complex or you have been told by people that you’re incapable of doing something, whether you’re suffering a setback in your venture or you’ve not even started yet due to fear, this book will add a dash of confidence to your thoughts and deeds. It all flows in simple, plain language, as if a friend is sitting across the table, speaking with you about your troubles and help stimulate your thought process, through which you get to correct your thought process and solve your troubles on your own. There is no peppering of quotes from ancient philosophers and certainly no repetition of platitudes as many popular modern-day authors wont to do.\n\nIf you would want to read only one book of the personal development genre ever, choose this one. For, this is such a beautiful, brilliant and worthwhile stuff!",
    "I never could have imagined self development as being a KEY aspect for business, which is the reason I picked up this book and many other books.\n\nDavid explains that having big ambitions in life is no more difficult than having small ambitions (contrary to popular belief).\n\nOne of the reasons why people fail is due to what the author calls 'Excusitis' i.e. developing excuses of health, age, believing you don't have what it takes etc. After going into detail about these aspects, David provides you with solutions to tackles these mental obstacles that prevent you from taking action.\n\nI have read this book along with a few other books about achieving success. The common theme I have found within them is the development of your mind and to replace negative programming with positive programming. To me that makes total sense as the number 1 reason why people give up is not due to their lack of physical ability, rather their lack of mental ability.\n\nThe book isn't very big to get through and only takes a few hours to read. This is definitely staying on my bookshelf and is something I will pick up from time to time when I feel deflated and need a quick boost of mental energy!",
    "I purchased this book a couple of months ago,this book was suggested to me by Ravindrababu Rabula who is teacher and is giving coaching for GATE CS in Hyderabad, while reading this book you will feel that the writer himself is talking with you and telling you all what he has written on the book,whether you do a small thing or big you will get confidence that you will do it, I think this book is most likely and similar to \"THINK AND GROW RICH \" BY Napolean Hill but I have not read that book but I think it might be,you will be able know yourself.If you have heard from anyone about this book don't think twice GO FOR IT ,these books are FAR BETTER than the books written by CHETAN BHAGAT if anyone is reading his book just for entertainment purpose, you will develop yourself by reading these books.And moreover this book is also available in most of the RAILWAY STATIONS of INDIA.And I am not sponsoring anyone whether Amazon is better or Flipkart is better,where you get less price buy it.",
    "Super read, one of the best at summarising lots of books key messages. One of the main points for me that stood out is near the end. Find time to think by yourself everyday. Don't 'fill' every moment of the day with TV or radio or small talk or gossip, make the time to think about the things you NEED to think about",
    "Not going to give the book less stars than it deserves, as it is a classic guide to living a better life.\n\nGreat book.... BUT\n\nThe copy I have received as a gift has pathetic edits of switching words from the original manuscript in and attempt to be “new-age” or “politically correct”. She, she, she, she.\n\nHow disrespectful, to change the original work of a deceased author. DO NOT TAMPER WITH WORK THAT IS NOT YOURS.\n\nAlso, there’s random punctuation typos all over the book. Just, what the ****.\n\nIt makes me wonder WHAT ELSE they’ve changed, maybe even cut out.\n\nSabotage. What a shame."

    "This book gives us the tools to still be our introvert self and use it to our advantage.\n\nIt is the same approach that Mahatma Gandhi uses to mobilize a whole nation against a mighty colonial power, what makes Warren Buffett can keep his head above the irrational herd, what gives Isaac Newton the focus to discover the theory of gravity or Albert Einstein to discover his theory of relativity, what provides JK Rowling and George Orwell their observational skills and the solitude to write them down.\n\nSo, what are introvert and extrovert? According to psychologist Carl Jung, introvert people are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, while extrovert people to the external life of people and activities. Introverts focus on the meaning they interpret from the events happening around them, while extroverts plunge directly into the events themselves. Introverts recharge their energy by being alone, while extroverts recharge theirs by socializing. It is one of the very essence of our personality, a natural trait that cannot be forced no matter how much you try.\n\nTake the story of introverted Rosa Parks, for example, how her calm demeanor was the perfect fit for the bus protest incident and would not have been successful had the person sitting there was the extrovert and fiery Martin Luther King Jr. Nor would it be a success if the preaching role of Dr King was forced upon the quiet Ms Parks. Indeed, it is about the best way to measure our response in accordance to our true nature, as both Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks proceeded to influence the civil rights movement with their own comfortable demeanor.\n\nBut how can someone be a natural extrovert while other be a natural introvert? Introversion-extroversion can be detected from the early age, from looking at how sensitive babies are towards the stimulus of their environment, with high-reactivity nature represents one biological basis of introversion. This is what commonly acknowledged as “being a sensitive person.” The more high-reactive a baby is (i.e. introverted) the quieter they become as they don’t seek any more stimulants, while extroverted babies (and hence, adults) constantly seek more stimulants from outside of their brain to feel more alive.\n\nFurthermore, according to the author, Susan Cain, “[h]igh-reactive kids [i.e. introverts] who enjoy good parenting, child care, and a stable home environment tend to have fewer emotional problems and more social skills than their lower-reactive peers, studies show. Often they’re exceedingly empathic, caring, and cooperative.” Cain then elaborates, “[t]hey work well with others. They are kind, conscientious, and easily disturbed by cruelty, injustice, and irresponsibility. They’re successful at the things that matter to them. They don’t necessarily turn into class presidents or stars of the school play... though this can happen, too: “For some it’s becoming the leader of their class. For others it takes the form of doing well academically or being well-liked.””\n\nHowever, in a society where extroverts are the model aspiration, being an introvert can be challenging. The book dedicate one whole chapter on the history of extrovert culture that began in the US, that covers examples of how society came to worship extrovert traits and personalities - from Dale Carnegie to Tony Robbins to the Harvard Business School culture - which creates the stigma that the model of success are those who conform to this nature.\n\nThe book then analyses the cultural aspect of introversion-extroversion, with Western culture praise more of extroversion and Eastern culture promotes introversion. It also cover the risk takers and risk averse traits that can be heavily linked to extroversion and introversion, which adds a new angle on the irrational exuberance culture among majority extroverted Wall Street geniuses that fail to think rationally in the face of risk. As Cain remarks, “just as the amygdala [the emotional, flight-or-fight, part of the brain] of a high-reactive person is more sensitive than average to novelty, so do extroverts seem to be more susceptible than introverts to the reward-seeking cravings of the old brain. In fact, some scientists are starting to explore the idea that reward-sensitivity is not only an interesting feature of extroversion; it is what makes an extrovert an extrovert.”\n\nIn other words, extroverts are characterized by their tendency to seek outside reward, from the no 1 champion status to sexual highs to cold cash. Hence, their greater economic, political, and hedonistic ambitions compared with introverts. As Cain elaborates, “even their sociability is a function of reward-sensitivity, according to this view—extroverts socialize because human connection is inherently gratifying.\"\n\nHowever, although extroverts and introverts have contrasting personalities they can still co-exist nicely - whether it's family, friendship, work environment, or romantic relationship -, with the book discusses through plenty of case studies where both successful and failed relationship occur. For instance, the book point out the psychological findings that introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts, while extroverts prefer those they compete with. This will be very useful in plenty of social contexts, especially in negotiation.\n\nIt also elaborates on how introverts can fully utilize our natural traits. For example, it’s so happened that for introverts they can “fake” extroversion, which stems from psychological theories covered neatly in the book, like the Free Trait Theory and Fixed Trait Theory. But in the end of the day, that will eat us inside. Instead, I found the most inspiration in the curious case of Jon Berghoff, a highly introverted person that becomes the best regional salesman by not faking an extroverted traits, but by comfortably using his introvert way of heart-to-heart communication that speaks to his strengths.\n\nThis book is such an enlightenment that I suddenly can spot the extroverts and introverts in my surroundings, complete on the spectrum of calm extrovert, anxious extrovert, calm introvert, and anxious introvert that the book brilliantly describes. All the behaviour that they are making, their reaction on things, their decision making, the choice of people they surround themselves with, the problems they are making, etc, all become clear.\n\nAnd in the end of the day, as the book shows, what matters it not the cards that have been give to us, but how we use them. Likewise, it’s not about certain personality traits that would makes you successful or not, it's how you maximize the one that you already have - whether it’s extrovert or introvert - with the right mindset and attitude, at the right environment, with the right crowd. As Susan Cain remarks, \"[w]e often marvel at how introverted, geeky kids “blossom” into secure and happy adults. We liken it to a metamorphosis. However, maybe it’s not the children who change but their environments. As adults, they get to select the careers, spouses, and social circles that suit them. They don’t have to live in whatever culture they’re plunked into.\"",
    "I believe this book saved my life. I'm not prone to melodrama, or to such excessively long reviews, but this is true, and so important to me, I have to say it. I've been working for years in an extremely busy law office. It's been growing harder and harder throughout the years for me to handle this job. Two months ago my boss fired my coworker, and I've since had to take on two people's work plus train multiple new people (as the first two didn't stay), all with constant, all day long interruptions, high-intensity demands, and a high level of multitasking. This has happened many times before, and while it was dreadful, I managed, but for some reason this time I just couldn't handle it. My entire life has been on hold since this started, I get home from work too exhausted to do anything except veg out for a couple hours and go to bed, and even weekends aren't much better. I was taking terrible care of myself and my life was falling apart. I did, in fact, feel like I was killing myself with this lifestyle, but I simply did not have the energy to fix any of it, or for that matter have any idea how to fix it.\n\nI blamed myself - there must be something `wrong with me' because I can't handle the job. I wanted to leave, but thought, if I can't handle this job, how am I going to handle a new job? It'll probably be more of the same. I thought I was just getting soft because I was getting older (I'm in my late 40s).\n\nI've always known I was introverted, but I didn't realize just what all that entailed - I thought it mostly meant `shy' or that I didn't like social settings.\n\nThis book taught me more about myself than I've ever known. It read like my biography. Almost every page had a new insight into why I think and feel the way I do. Throughout the book I saw my very own self described in new and empowering ways.\n\nI learned that the job situation I'm currently in - the non-stop deadline demands, interruptions, never being able to work quietly or alone no matter how difficult a project was, phones ringing incessantly, people in my face all day long, etc. - especially when it's work that I actually don't care anything about personally - those are the exact circumstances that trip every one of a strong introvert's triggers. And I was subjecting myself to it 40 hours a week, for months.\n\nIt's no wonder I was so miserable and completely exhausted all the time. And as enlightening as it was to learn how many of the traits I've beat myself up for over the years are just a product of my introverted temperament (being highly sensitive, shutting down when subjected to stimulation overload, preferring to think a thing through before I speak - something I never get to do at work, as if it takes me more than 5 seconds to say something, I get interrupted and cut off), the most important thing I got from this book is that it's okay to be myself, it's okay to feel the way I do. There is not something `wrong with me' that I have to `fix.' I am not weak or a failure because I don't feel or behave like my extremely extroverted boss (who thrives in high-energy crisis mode, and is bored unless he's doing 10 things at once - and expects the rest of us to keep up).\n\nAnd far from it being an age-related `going soft,' what's probably in fact going on is that as I get older, it is becoming increasingly vital to me to be truer to myself.\n\nI also found the information on the history of the \"rise of the Culture of Personality\" completely fascinating, it really gave me a new insight as to just exactly how we 'grew' this tendency to value extroversion over introversion. It makes so much more sense now.\n\nThis book gave me the courage I needed to start taking the steps to fix my work situation. Not only the courage, but the `permission' and the understanding - because I now know there isn't something wrong with me, but instead this is what I need to do to be my best self, and stop killing myself with stress. That I probably can find a place of value in the world by being myself, not trying to force myself to be something I'm not. I know I will meet resistance from my boss (I'd love for him to read this book, but unfortunately I know he won't), and I know I won't instantly fix everything in one day, and that I'll probably always need to be able to stretch myself a bit to do things that are not ideal for me ... but this book taught me that there are ways to make that work, too, if you understand and honor the need for recharging around such tasks, instead of trying to force yourself to do them 8 hours a day with no break. It doesn't have to be all or nothing, in either direction. Basically, I'm not out of the woods yet, but I now see the path out, and I have hope.\n\nI think every introvert should read this book, because it will help you understand why you are who you are, and why that's a beautiful thing, not a character flaw. And I think everyone who knows an introvert should read this book, and quit trying to \"fix us.\"\n\nWhich means pretty much the entire country (or world) should read this book. The wealth of information and insights in this book cannot be overstated - especially if you are an introverted type of person who has always felt there was something not quite right about you, or that you somehow needed to change to fit in or succeed. This book will give you back yourself, and in my case, my life. Thank you, Susan Cain, from the bottom of my heart (which is finally beating at a more normal speed because I'm not panicked about going to work for the first time in months).\n\nEdited 11-13-14: It worked! I'm now working half-days at the office and half-days at home, and in a few weeks will transition to working from home full time. I never imagined that could happen. It's amazing what becomes possible when you finally realize you deserve what you already knew you needed.",
    "I am an introvert. I have been struggling my entire life to know what am I why am I behaving in the way which is uncomfortable and felt like an alien around cheerful, outgoing and talkative people.\nI have faced a lot of people asking the same questions repeatedly like\nWhy are so quiet? What are you thinking the whole time?\nWhat will you do at home the whole day?\nWhy don't you mingle with all in any kind of gatherings? You look so serious is there any problem? And in addition to this, I experience a distressing and weird reaction of my hand getting sweat and hearing my own heartbeat whenever I stand up in my classroom to speak up feeling overwhelmed while entering a shopping mall or a public market. These are the questions and experiences faced and felt for which I don't any kind of answer. So I started to search on the internet and even had a thought of consulting a psychiatrist but I didn't.\nIn the process, I came to know the people who are quiet, shy, solitary, etc are considered as a category called introverts. From then I have been searching to know more about introverts like articles, videos, books, etc. I have watched Susan Cain's Ted talk and longed to read this book. After reading this book I have an answer to all my questions and struggles personally experienced.\nThe book was well written. It gives us a detailed history of America on how the culture of outgoing, assertive, showmanship prevailed during the 20th century. It tells us the transformation of the culture of character to the culture of personality in a short period. It bursts the myth of charismatic leadership that even quiet people who think before they speak can be good leaders in their own ways. Extroverts and Introverts have their own pros and cons in every position in life and society.\nThe second part goes into the brains of introverted kids and tries to explore the reasons for introverted behavior whether it depends on the nature of their mind or can be nurtured while growing depending on their environments.\nThe next part describes us about relationships with introverts as it is said that for every three people there is one introvert so it can be your partner, brother, sister, friend and children.\nIt gives a detailed description and advice on how to understand and empathize with your relationships.\nIt is a Good Book and a definite read for everyone to understand the people around you because one third to half the world's population are introverts.\nIt answered all my questions about my personality, I kind of felt normal not an alien😁 anymore after reading this book.",
    "Our society has placed extroverts as a golden standard: parents, school and employers expect a child/a person to be outgoing, confident and sociable. Contributing to the discussions, taking an initiative, competitiveness and be good at public speaking seem to be a must for a bright future.\n\nWhat if your child is an introvert and does not like to be in the centre of public attention, prefers to have a deeper relationship with a smaller group of friends and occasionally needs to recharge the energy level by being on his/her own?\n\nMy daughter turned 8 this week and she did not want to have any birthday party. She does not enjoy competitions, she is uncomfortable joining new groups and takes her time to make new friends. She enjoys playing imaginary games or reading a book. At the same time, when at home or with a small group of friends, my daughter is a bubbly, chatty girl.\n\nAs a (mostly) extrovert mum, I have made my share of mistakes with my child. When adults try to talk to my daughter and she does not reply, I jump in with the comment, “She is shy”. Worth of it, I would push my daughter to talk to adults (like ordering in the restaurants) to the extent that she would get so nervous and get a tick. That made me stop and think. I started to look for help in some books and , luckily, I came across a wonderful book by Susan Cain, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop.\n\nThe book does not only explain the nature of introverts and helps to understand their character better, but also gives practical advice how to make sure you help introverts not to go against their nature but let them flourish in the culture of extroverts.\n\nThank you Ms Cain for such a wonderful gift to the parents!",
    "I absolutely love this book. It’s the kind of book that you read and find yourself nodding along to, and then thinking about during the day, and then realising this example fits here and that situation is like that, and oh! That’s why….\n\nThe writing is an excellent mix between research, case studies and thoughtful conclusions, all balanced so it never feels boring or overwhelming. There is a section of endnotes, and because I was reading the Kindle version, the notes were all linked – if you click on the note, it takes you to the endnotes with a longer explanation! I get happy about the little things.\n\nThe ideas are also incredibly interesting. Not everything will apply to all introverts, but I’d recommend this book to anyone – it’s really interesting to be challenged on how I view the world from an introvert perspective (like arguing – raising your voice means an attack! But for extroverts, it’s a sign of passion and involvement) and it’s really interesting to realise how those difference shape society and interactions with others.\n\nIt’s also so, so reassuring. This is me. This is some reasons why I might do the things I do, why I don’t like parties in a certain format, why I need down time when other people don’t. It’s being reminded that it’s ok to be different, and that actually there are other people out there who are similar – even if I live and work in a world that seems full of extroverts, it’s ok to need alone time, and that my strengths don’t have to lie in the same things – listening, thoughtfulness and consideration are all important, even if they come at a cost of an immediate answer or participation in small-talk. It was also reassuring to realise that being able to extrovert on occasion is normal – it just comes at more of a cost to introverts than it does to extroverts!\n\nInteresting, thoughtful, readable and inspiring – the kind of book that leaves you thinking about it a long time after you’ve shut it.",
    "Firstly, if you don't read the rest of this review, I just want to say: if you are an introvert, buy this book right now. You won't regret it.\n\nI got this book on a recommendation on a forum where I was researching about how to be more confident a person. I've been struggling recently, becoming more senior in my role at work and so have felt pressured to be more comfortable in my own skin and get my ideas across in a way that people listen. It just doesn't come naturally to me, and I was starting to judge myself for it and feel like I wasn't good enough because everybody expects you to be a particular way.\n\nWell, after reading this book, I would challenge anybody who makes me feel like it's not okay to be the way I am and would explain that even though I am quiet, the world still needs people like me just as much as it needs people that can grab attention from everybody in a room. And I also understand that even though I might need to be a \"pseudo-extrovert\" at times and can learn how to be good at public speaking and will still need to put myself in uncomfortable situations for the sake of things I believe in, I still need down-time and respect the fact that I am happiest when I have time to recharge at home or spend time with my family in a calm and cosy setting. I also think this book will help me when I have children in making sure that whether I have an introverted or extroverted child, they have all the support they can from me no matter what.\n\nSusan Cain has an amazing writing style and I've never been kept interested to read a book like this from start to finish, as it has a lot of references to studies and usually I find this quite boring in other non-fiction books to do with health. But she keeps you involved, and forever writes about things that I'm guessing a lot of people can relate to whilst you carry on reading. She also reflects on a lot of experiences she's had with various people - again, something I don't usually enjoy, but it is written so well that I was never bored for a moment.\n\nThe book is quite long and has smaller writing than a lot of books I read, but honestly - read it. If you class yourself as an introvert, just buy it. It will change your life.",
    "Fairly interesting, with a few a-ha moments but too arm's length for me, too many boring case studies and most of them concerning pretty high-powered people in situations to which I couldn't relate. Not much here for your everyday introvert trying to be heard and accepted - or, at least, not misunderstood and insulted - in a world full of extroverts. Left me feeling that if you're not a Steve Wozniak, Eleanor Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, J K Rowling or Ghandi, you fall outside Susan Cain's radar and that insults less accomplished introverts in the way that ordinary disabled people are sometimes insulted for not being Paralympians. She self-references a lot in this book and that underscores the feeling of it being only for 'introverts-like-us'. A work of academic interest, I suppose, but not designed to equip your average introvert for a world that doesn't, by and large, understand or accept them."

    "Patrick Radden Keefe is the best writer I have read in a long time. You finish all 452 pages and you know very well the story could never have been more succinct, more tight: it’s perfect. Three Jewish brothers, sons of immigrants, are intelligent, enterprising, and devoted. One of them, Arthur Sackler, is attentive to dilemmas of mental patients and appalled at the lack of medical interventions to alleviate pain. His research led to the invention of Valium and eventually, Oxycontin. Arthur bought a pharmaceutical manufacturing company (Purdue),and brothers Mortimer and Raymond would manage it. As time evolves both the pain treatment world and the development of drugs to treat pain, Purdue folks realize that oxy condone seemed to prescribing physicians as less threatening than traditional morphine; earlier Bayer had manufactured heroin as morphogenetic without the pesky side effects—-even though heroin was more powerful and just as addictive. This is really a turning point in the narration of the opiod crisis story: Purdue executives decide to follow a similar strategy and they begin to exploit the misunderstanding that oxy was less strong, more safe. In those days, doctors knew what they knew about oxy based on Percocet in which a very small dose of oxycodone is combined with acetaminophen or aspirin. The company for reasons of profit and sales decides to enhance the product’s appeal to doctors by pushing it for non-malignant pain—-forms of chronic pain because, after all, who doesn't have some of that? So the appeal expanded far beyond cancer patients—-not only would its use become widened for all sorts of patients (even juveniles), but the dosage could be increased. And so it was. The relationships with doctors in the field, the Food and Drug Administration, and the countless museums which benefitted from Sackler generosity weaves a very tangled web of unchecked capitalism and moral poverty. Purdue decided to create a special coating which would minimize the risk of addiction—or perhaps remove that risk altogether. This unique “improvement” would eliminate the risk of serious addiction (when is addiction NOT serious?) so that the wedding of the opium poppy and pain management could be obtained without danger. The sales and marketing of the product and the wooing of doctors is the most sorrowful chapter of unfettered capitalism: people started dying from overdoses. There is something odd about “the guns-don’t- kill people; people- kill- people” thinking here—-the Sacklers claimed addicts misused the product and truly, it could not be seen as their fault nor their responsibility. Most of us would remember Big Tobacco litigation and walking a mile for a Camel or the Marlboro Man: now the Purdue company was spending millions per month on litigation, but that litigation was seen as an annoyance at best. A photographer widely recognized for her artistic expression and product, Nan Goldin, developed a painful case of tendinitis in a wrist and a doctor prescribed OxyContin. The drug felt to her “like a padding between you and the world.” For three years she took the pills, always upping the ante and taking more and more. She overdosed. She was hooked, and she knew it, so at the age of 62, she checked herself into a rehabilitation facility of great repute and began a journey to sobriety. In 2017, she read an article in the New Yorker magazine about the opiod crisis which mentioned the drug developed by the Sacklers and their company which painted a picture in stark contrast between their generosity in the world of culture and their —-well, depravity—-their source of Great Wealth. A Chair of Psychiatry at the esteemed Duke University noted that the Sackler name is known as the source of good and philanthropic work, but actually those gifts and their fortune come to us as the result of the millions of people who are addicted to their product. Phillip Radden Keefe was the writer of the magazine article. As a result of the readership of the magazine and the compelling content of the article (we all know the New Yorker doesn’t limit its writers—that the magazine tells the whole story), the Sackler family came under ever increasing scrutiny for their role in the opiod crisis. Nan Goldin arranged for protests in some of the very museums once blessed with Sackler funds and she just would not stop. Nor would Keefe: he interviewed Purdue employees and saw Denial in the lot of them; the reader of this expose will see Greed as the driving principle. This books calls into question the entire scheme—-advertisers and marketers, wholesalers, doctors who wrote the scripts, and the pharmacies who carried the drug. The only whistleblower who emerges from the entire dreadful Mess is Patrick Radden Keefe himself. Read this book if you want another example of how unfettered capitalism contains the seeds of its own destruction: sorrowful.",
    "I enjoyed the fact based nature of this book very much. At points, I found the sheer amount of information provided which included some repetition of facts, overwhelmed the “story” Patrick was telling (thus my 4 vs. 5 star rating).\n\nWith this aside, I have a far greater understanding of and appreciation for how the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma contributed to the opioid and addition epidemic that still plagues our country today.\n\nHaving read this book, I hold out hope that the more we understand our history, the less likely we are to repeat it.",
    "Couldn't put this down. I feel sick understanding the freedom and money the Sacklers still have. Make them look at endless photos of people found dead from OxyContin overdoses.",
    "The book is an eye-opener on the opioid crisis and to what extent both good and bad actors went to make their case.",
    "There was so much research in this book, yet it like a novel that you can’t put down. It often made me think of the HBO series Succession, although the family here runs prescription pills instead of news. A very important story, likely one of the most important of the 21st Century so far.",
    "This is an interesting book. I wish the author had spent a little more time explaining *how* OxyContin works or that OxyContin is just generic Oxycodone with a delayed release coating (maybe everybody knew that but me).\n\nThe author makes a persuasive case that the Sackler Family are about the most arrogant and repulsive people you could ever meet (they literally get more loathsome with each generation which seems impossible). The records are also pretty clear that they lied in their aggressive marketing knowing the pills were addictive (even when used under doctor supervision) and that it was just all about the money.\nAll that said, I feel the author should have been a little more skeptical of some of the more outspoken victims—like Nan Goldin, for example. By her own admission she was addicted to heroin and was a serious addict and battered woman before she ever tried OxyContin—she knew from the streets it was powerful and addictive BEFORE she ever took it; so not really sure she could blame all that dysfunction and misery on Oxy (or the Sacklers).\nDitto some of the others. Their stories kind of feed into the Sackler narrative that they’re being scapegoated—which is too bad (and all the carrying on about Goldin’s “art”—yikes. Disturbing photos are not necessarily art)\n\nMore persuasive would have been the stories that Raymond and Richard Sackler said didn’t exist—people who took the medicine as prescribed and became addicted. These stories are out there—the author mentions a few in passing—but that’s where the focus of the book should have been (imho). You keep waiting to hear *those* stories—but the author never recounts them.\n\nThe author also never acknowledges that in at least one sense—the Sacklers have a point. They are not responsible for people who purposely abused the drug. Drug addicts use NyQuil and snort cleaning solvents or model airplane glue. Are manufacturers of all those products responsible if some moron OD’s? I’d argue, no. The Sacklers *are* responsible for marketing and lying about a very addictive pain medication. They’re not responsible (in my view) if people microwave, crush, “purify” or otherwise turn that drug into something else. To me, Addicts who purposely misuse the drug do bear responsibility for their actions; the authors belief seems to be that addicts are *never* responsible—and to suggest otherwise makes you a monster—which makes no logical sense.\n\nLastly, i feel like the author’s bias, was kind of unfortunate. The Sacklers were huge Democratic donors—this is mentioned only in passing. For instance, Republican Rudy Giuliani spent less time representing the Family than heavyweight democratic fixers like Clark Clifford and Eric Holder; yet Rudy gets two pages and they are barely mentioned. Anytime a lawmaker calls the family to task (ie..a good guy) if he’s a Democrat, the author mentions it—if it’s a Republican he never does. The descriptions of characters are also pretty telling: the author has no issue telling you the Sacklers are Jewish, but if they’re bad actors (like Jayson Blair) you’re never told if they are black or gay (like horrid Kathe Sackler)—unless they are “good” (district attorney) in which case they are promoted as gay, black, democrat etc.—It’s obvious enough that when there *is* a missing descriptor you can be pretty sure it’s because it doesn’t match up neatly with the authors bias. After a while, it just became sort or tiresome—like “why is that even part of this? Why does that even matter?” And the idea that the author has an agenda detracts from the larger message.\n\nSo…interesting and well researched but the author’s bias, and intention to tar the greedy, unlikeable Sacklers with *everything* feels a little too simplistic.",
    "This is one of those stories that after it comes out it’s hard to understand how so much of it was kept under wraps for so long. Keefe doesn’t break all new ground here but he puts a nice bow on the story. Go for it.",
    "Sets out the corruption of Big Pharma and those who allowed opioids and profited from them.",
    "Best book I have read for ages, not much to add to the five stars reviews here. Investigative journalism and stylish writing of the highest order.",
    "I first read “Chatter” several years ago so when I came across “Say Nothing” I was keen to read more by this author. Several other reads later I searched to find the author again. Having read about the opioid epidemic and the Sackler family in the news, I was pleased to find this book. Once again I was impressed not only with the writing but with the thoroughness of the research!",
    "This was a fascinating read on a subject\nI had looked at in a minor way before.\nThis book is super detailed about the Oxy-Contin/Opioid scandal in the USA and beyond. Clever marketing by the Sackler family made them billions in a comparitively short time, whilst killing more 'pain sufferers' than all post WW11\ncasualties..",
    "Having previously read, \"Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern ireland,\" by Patrick Radden Keefe, and having seen that this title, \"Empire of Pain,\" had won the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction (my favourite book award), this was a must-read for me.\n\nI had read, and seen, various news stories on the opiod crisis in the US, but I knew very little of the Sackler family. This book combines the story of the the opiod crisis, the history of pain management, the mass marketing of opiods and a family history of the Sackler family. However, Patrick Radden Keefe is an excellent writer and so do not be put off by thinking this will be overly complicated or rely too much on medical jargon. The author makes this easy to understand, without dumbing down his writing, and tells a fascinating story of the three generations of the Sackler family, through ambition, philanthropy, and huge wealth, into greed, shame, seemingly endless litigation and blaming the family personally and naming them in Court.\n\nAlthough I found the entire book gripping, I must admit that I was most fascinated by the first generation, that of three brothers, Arthur, Montgomery and Raymond Sackler. Arthur's ambition, his desire for wealth and respectability, his drive for success, no matter what the cost, was a portrait of utter greed and naked ambition. The shameless marketing of drugs, with no thought of the cost to users, the later blaming of patients for becoming addicted was utterly shocking. The author compares this blaming of those addicted to drugs by the company, by those who insist that individuals should be able to own guns. It is not the gun who kills people, it is people who kill people. It is not the painkiller that kills people, it is people misusing the drug that kills people. Perhaps, anyone reading this, will be inspired to now tackle the horrific amount of gun crime in the US and realise that this spurious argument is nothing less than a lie in both cases.",
    "The history of this family and their disregard for anyone but themselves left me speechless"

    "Lessons that can be applied to work, love or any aspect of our lives we need to improve in order to have a healthy life; and all this without lecturing the reader. The author doesn't see lack of success as a sin, but as a stage from which we can learn and we can be strong to surpass and get the thrilling emotion to run and get into adventures, but not mindlessly as hard work is not necessarily productivity. And then when success is mentioned there is a caution about being too comfortable in it and not being ready to flow with the changes and be afraid of not having a youthful vision of ourselves. There is much that could be labeled as common sense but until reading this book, and a couple of other books, I couldn't place their importance in the way I do things. Being honest with oneself and acknowledge in what we are good and what actually hinders our goals was also quite an impactful version. I am more enthusiastic about the issues I face in my creative work and my customers are also more enthusiastic to have and pay for my services. I am still working in getting to achieve my goals and I sincerely recommend that this book should be in your basic personal library. Even if it is not understood by, let's say, children at home, the story is quite engaging.\n\nIf there is somebody that wouldn't like this book though, I think persons that like a direct approach to explain and not much of parables. Maybe not for Hems : D",
    "I worked for a company for 24 years in 7 roles and due to their lack of life balance this booked helped me move on.\nThere is never just one path.\nI gifted this to my son and daughter so that they can understand and be ready for shifts in life and careers.",
    "I’m a Real Estate agent and this book is a terrific read",
    "Fascinating read. Bought for my grandson but I started to reach it and couldn't put it down. Excellent principles for dealing with change in any environment. Challenging the status quo by overcoming change with a good attitude!",
    "Perfect - Product arrived on time and as described.",
    "I am no expert of reviewing. It was a well written idea and I certainly thought the book was fun. I think Spencer Johnson was on the precipice of an amazing concept but then he himself didn’t challenge his views on money. It was just simple and boring to me. I’ve found that you can get much more out of a book such as Tao Te Ching; it will cover all of the topics in this book as wel as many more. This is a good beginning source of education for a young audience. Finding better ways to learn is my cheese at the moment so I definitely got more out of this book then I am admitting. :)",
    "\nThere are a few books that everyone, regardless of their profession, should read. Among these would be Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography; How I Raised Myself From Failure to Success in Selling by Frank Bettger; How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie; The Power of Positive Thinking by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale; Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill; and this one, Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson, M. D.\n\nCritics will tell you that this book is simplistic. It reads very much like a child's story book. The critics would be right that it is simplistic and it is very much like a child's story book. Like Bill Cosby used to say at the beginning of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, \"If you aren't careful, you just might learn something.\"\n\nThe book is divided into four parts. The first part tells how the story and the book came into being. We read a discussion of how applicable the book is in many different settings and how valuable the book is to read. This is very much like preaching to the choir. Obviously, the reader has been sold on reading the book because they have already begun to do that at that point. Some readers may find themselves skipping past that part of the book or, at the very least, thinking, \"Just get on with it already.\"\n\nAs the reader reaches the second part of the book, they read about a class reunion where people who knew one another years before come together to catch up on old times. The friends talk about how life has changed and what they thought to be true years ago proved to be incorrect. One of the friends mentions the story and how it helped them to deal with life's changes.\n\nThe book shifts to the actual story. In the story, the reader is told about four characters, two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two little people, Hem and Haw.\n\nThe four characters are all faced with the same situation. They have cheese and then one day the cheese is gone. Cheese is a metaphor for whatever it is in life the reader values.\n\nHow the different characters deal with the loss of the cheese is significant to the story and helps the reader learn more about themselves, and those around them, and how everyone handles change.\n\nThe book then shifts back to a discussion among the friends who discuss how they applied the story to their lives and what changes they were able to make in their personal and professional lives. Discussion is made as to how the lesson could have helped had it been learned earlier and how it could be applied in the future.\n\nThe book is a very quick read and could probably be read in one sitting. Long ago, I read it to my children and they loved it. They learned from it and, for a while, the kids referred to different parts of the story and how it applied to current life events for our family.\n\nI purchased this book from Amazon years ago and it has been an important part of my library ever since. You may wish to borrow it free from your local library but, ultimately, you will want to obtain a copy for your own library.",
    "This is a book for employers to give to employees. The message is simple: If we treat you like a piece of crap, don’t question it. Accept it and move on, even if it means we put you out of a job. If you do question the way you have been treated - probably so that the bosses can make more money for themselves, then you deserve to be laughed at for not being forward thinking. As I read this I imagined I was being spoken to by some repulsive individual with a PowerPoint presentation and a flip chart. I regret having given the author of this my money.",
    "This book starts by telling you how amazing this cheese story is and how it changed the lives of many people. How you should repeat this story to everyone so everyone can change their lives, too. It will save your career, marriage and probably life! Then it tells you exactly what YOU will learn from it and what conclusions YOU will come to. This sentence can be found on page 18, way before you even read the actual story - 'However, as you watch what the four characters do, and realize both the mice and the Littlepeople represent parts of ourselves, it would be to our advantage to do the simple things that work when things change'.\n\nYou then have a couple of pages where old friends engage in a completely natural conversation with lines such as:\n'He asked, \"But, have you noticed how we don't want to change when things change?\" Carlos said, \"I guess we resist changing, because we're afraid of change\".'\nIt also has the audacity to tell you that if people don't find this story life-changing or worthwhile, it's because in most cases, they're the \"bad\" character from the story - unwilling to change.\n'They either knew the lessons and were already living them, or, more commonly, they thought they already knew everything and didn't want to learn' - p.23\n'When one of our senior executives who was having a difficult time adapting, said the story was a waste of time, other people kidded him saying they knew which character he was in the story - meaning the one who learned nothing new and did not change' - p. 23\n\nYou then have the grand, life-changing story which is clunky, cheesy (pun intended!), simple and obvious. There's not much to say about the lessons this story is trying to convey, because it would take me more time I'm willing to waste on it. It simplifies things and offends the intelligence of anyone reading. Every other page is an image of cheese with some corny, quotable line such as \"When you see that you can find and enjoy new cheese, you change course\". The story is written in the most patronizing and infantile voice that it almost seems like the author thinks he's speaking to idiots. He probably does think that, because the next chapter consists of the same gathering of friends talking about how wonderful the story is, how it changed businesses, each person talks about how it applies to their life, and what each thing in it meant - from the names of characters to events and absolutely everything in between. Just in case you didn't get it!\n\nHorrible waste of time. I don't remember what was the last time a book offended me this much. But hey, I'm probably just a Hem - unwilling to change and understand the brilliancy of this story. The last quote from this book, probably my favourite, very much explains how I feel about all of it.\n'That's what I got out of the story. I tend to take myself too seriously. I noticed how Haw changed when he could finally laugh at himself and at what he was doing. No wonder he was called Haw\"\nThe group groaned at the obvious play on words.'",
    "I have worked in the same job for over 25 years with many bosses coming and going. Each one reinvented the wheel, as was their prerogative. Over the last few years the job I loved became a 'cancer' I hadn't realised, and whilst it has made me very ill psychologically and emotionally, just reading this book (in one go) has given me answers and confirmations that have given me clarity and a peace I haven't felt in years. Everyone on the planet should read this. There's something in it for everyone. God bless you for writing this. I have lived with incredible fear for so long, and I believe I will sleep like a baby tonight.",
    "Very easy to read book with a very easy to understand message. Maybe not everyone wants to see the message and some will think they are being patronized in a juvenile story about basic common sense.\n\nBut it's meant to be so simplistic that the thought is focused on the message rather than the storyline. You are sure to find yourself associating with three out of the four characters and although most wont admit to being the character Hem there are many out there just like him and stuck in their past.\n\nSo many people see themselves as flexible but back up their stubborn stance as expertise gained from experience. Well we would all be walking around in loin clothes and grunting at each other if progress was restricted by experience.\n\nThis short easy to read book is well worth keeping in your library to remind yourself from time to time how easy it is to get stuck in the past. I have my copy, and purchased this one for my 17 year old nephew to help him see how to move on and leave his childhood old cheese behind.\n\nChange is often seen as a bad thing and although it's not always easy to accept, sometimes there is no alternative and the best way to deal with it is to make the best you can out of it. Surely good advice.\n\nNot everyone will want to contemplate the message of the book and often the ones stuck in their ways will argue the toss loudest. But there is an audience for this kind of book and out of the 26 million people who have purchased it there are bound to be arguments on both sides of the fence. That's what having an opinion is about isn't it?",
    "I bought this for one of my apprentices who needed some support in handling change. This is the response she sent me after reading it:\n\nI would like you to know I read Who Moved My Cheese? On my way home last night.\n\nI found it so enlightening! I feel like even when it comes to managing change us humans tend to overcomplicate things and make simple tasks way more complex than they need to be. Seeing it put in such a basic format made the information easier to digest – Mice, littlepeople & cheese!\n\nI also really appreciated how the book focusses on how most of the time we scare ourselves out of enjoying change because we don’t know what will happen, Its like spinning a wheel where 9 slots have £1m and 1 slot has instantaneous death😃\n\nI see how people love to panic when change comes around (literally me as soon as any insignificant thing in my life changes) and it’s a waste of energy.\n\nHowever, I will say the one thing I didn’t like in the book was when they mentioned that you should anticipate change – that made me a bit nervous because I would feel as if I’d always have to be on edge and that would make me feel almost paranoid that change is coming to get me, so I will definitely be taking that with a pinch of salt.\n\nBut overall, an amazing read I think my sister will benefit greatly from reading it too! Thanks Michelle 😊\n\nPlus she has added today :\n\nI’ve also spoken about the book on a couple of my social media channels and quite a few of my friends have decided it would be a very insightful read."

    "This book tackles one of the main challenges many have, not many have the time to go for a 1 hour or 2 hours coaching session. How to lazer coach people effectively? These 7 questions introduced in the book are very handy. As a professional coach, I use these questions already before reading the book, however, the author highlights these 7 questions among a lot of other questions, which makes coaching easy and doable for many managers.",
    "Oh, my.\n\nMEMO TO EVERY PERSON I’VE PRETENDED TO COACH OR MENTOR: I’m so, so sorry! Honest!\n\nHere’s why. This month I was a learner in a seminar with CEOs and board chairs. The highly energetic, wise and witty facilitator was Michael Bungay Stanier, the author of the hot-off-the-press book, “The Coaching Habit.”\n\nAt a coffee break, halfway through the three-hour, how-to-coach practicum, I told Stanier that—already—the seminar was on my Top-10 list of best workshops ever attended (and I’ve attended my fair share). Here’s why I gave it a 10:\n\nThree memorable points on coaching:\n--BE LAZY: Stop working so hard.\n--BE CURIOUS: Stop giving so much advice.\n--BE OFTEN: Stop waiting to coach.\n\nAnd how’s this for role reversal? I’m usually reading snippets from books to my wife. She picked this up first and is still reading—and reminding me—on what effective coaching looks like, especially the “stop giving so much advice” poke-in-the-ribs. Ouch.\n\nStanier notes that “Harland Howard said every great country song has three chords and the truth. This book gives you seven questions and the tools to make them an everyday way to work less hard and have more impact.” The seven essential questions:\n--The Kickstart Question\n--The AWE Question\n--The Focus Question\n--The Foundation Question\n--The Lazy Question\n--The Strategic Question\n--The Learning Question\n\nStanier says the best coaching question in the world is the AWE question: “And What Else?”\n\nIn a four-minute drill with another board chair, I was instructed to ask four questions displayed on the seminar room screen. Stanier says “the first answer someone gives you is almost never the only answer, and it’s rarely the best answer,” so the AWE question is the perfect follow-up.\n--Q1: What’s the real challenge here for you?\n--Q2: And what else?\n--Q3: And what else?\n--Q4: So what’s the real challenge here for you?\n\nIn just four minutes—it was almost magical. I stuck to the bargain (whew—very hard) and just asked questions of my board chair partner. He responded to each question—and increasingly, in response to “And what else?” he dug deeper and deeper and—BINGO!—answered his own question and solved his own challenge.\n\nWhere was this book when I was pretending to coach team members, clients, my son, my grandkids, and many, many others? Yikes!\n\nI’ve underlined gems on almost every page:\n--Although coaching is listed as one of the six essential leadership styles in Daniel Goleman’s article, “Leadership That Gets Results” (a Harvard Business Review classic), “it was the least-used leadership style.”\n--“You can build a coaching habit” and “You can coach someone in ten minutes or less. And in today’s busy world, you have to be able to coach in ten minutes or less.”\n--“Coaching should be a daily, informal act, not an occasional, formal ‘It’s Coaching Time!’ event.”\n\nStanier’s humor sneaks up on you! As you embark on what he calls the “coaching habit,” he suggests you start somewhere easy:\n\n“If you’re going to manage someone differently, pick someone who might be up for it and is willing to cut you some slack. Or pick someone with whom it’s all going so badly that you’ve got nothing left to lose.”\n\nANOTHER AHA! The author says there’s a huge difference between coaching for performance—and coaching for development. “Call them forward to learn, improve and grow, rather than to just get something sorted out.”\n\nA gargantuan fan of questions—versus answers—he quotes Nancy Willard: “Answers are closed rooms; and questions are open doors that invite us in.”\n\n“CUT THE INTRO AND ASK THE QUESTION” is another shot over the bow. He notes, “No James Bond movie starts off slowly. Pow! Within 10 seconds you’re into the action, the adrenaline has jacked and the heart is beating faster”—so “cut the preliminary flim-flam” in your coaching process. In 72-point font on page 52, Stanier shouts: “If you know what question to ask,\nget to the point and ask it.”\n\nTAME THE ADVICE MONSTER! “We’ve all got a deeply ingrained habit of slipping into the advice-giver/expert/answer-it/solve-it/fix-it mode.” (One study revealed that doctors interrupt patients with advice within 18 seconds. Ditto, perhaps, the rest of us.)\n\nSlow down and take a breath, says Stanier. “Even though we don’t really know what the issue is, we’re quite sure we’ve got the answer they need.”\n\nVP OF BOTTLENECKING. If your employee name badge should read “VP of Bottlenecking,” you must read this book. These seven essential coaching questions will help you coach others, and as Stanier perceptively writes, “Focus on the real problem, not the first problem.”\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of more gems in this fresh, easy-to-read format (plus almost 50 full-page quotations—all PowerPoint-worthy). I just ordered eight books for colleagues who are coaching boards and CEOs this year.",
    "This book was very insightful. It always hit home when you can see yourself in the words. I’m looking forward to using the questions to create some new habits.",
    "I enjoyed this book because it is practical. I pictured myself in many scenarios using the tips as I read each chapter on the 7 essential questions.\n\nThis book is organized and flows well. The accompanied videos linked to the book were useful as well, but seemed repetitive to the content of the book.\n\nI recommend this book for anyone who wants to stay curious and learn. Most importantly, I recommend this book for anyone who truly want to help others succeed by allowing them to explore their own situations and decide on what actions to take.",
    "If you like people and are really serious about being a good manager this book is a must. I’ve probably learned more from this book and the accompanying videos then I’ve learned in 20 years of managing. Wish I had read this 20 years ago. It’s entertaining, thought-provoking and really makes a lot of sense. I have already started to change the way I ask questions and it has made a huge difference immediately. I really like the kindle version for the links to other video or audio conversations I also like that I can highlight and take notes on my e-reader for referencing later. Learned about this book from another book, Talk Rx. I recommend it as well although it only comes in paperback.",
    "No hustle transaction. No surprises. On-time and as described.",
    "Read this book with about 12 of my staff, including a handful of managers. I thought the read was engaging and informative. The resulting discussion was productive and enjoyable. Would recommend to any people manager as an additional tool in their toolbox.",
    "This book has enough research mixed in with real life examples that makes it real. Asking questions is now a must habit for me",
    "Personally, I was never going to write a review of this book, because I consider the contents to be a delicious unfair advantage.\n\nBut I've just watched a YouTube video of the author asking very politely for reviews :( for compelling reasons which I was too busy internally sulking to remember now.\n\nSo, during this extremely brief period where my conscience has gotten the better of me, here goes...\n\nAs a terminally lazy person obsessed with producing outstanding results, you could say this book and i are a match made in heaven... talk about essentialism in action! The potent simplicity of its coaching framework is sublime. If this book were a human, I'd totally 'put a ring on it'.\n\nBut I suspect this book also lands squarely in the sweet spot of anyone who regularly deals with humans. Not just those expected to swim in coaching waters as part of their profession.\n\nSo *resentful sigh*, if you absolutely insist on becoming great at 'How to People\", buy it. READ IT. Preferably immediately. Every reviewer who stuck it on a wait list or shelf and 'got around' to reading it, reports regretting not giving it immediate preferential treatment. You will too.\n\nIf after only a few chapters, you're not seriously committed to making the books contents THE keystone communication habits of your managing/teaching/coaching/training/farming/chauffeuring/doctoring/hairdressing practice... I'll be genuinely surprised....\n\nAnd really really relieved. Because my results get to stay looking amazing (with little effort) in comparison :)",
    "I picked this up last year during a family holiday having had it in my pile of books to read for some time. Almost instantly I regretted having let it languish in the pile waiting its turn. This is easily one of the most effective books I’ve read – really easy to bring into your daily life, yet powerful enough to be cautious about how you use the content.\n\nMichael breaks down 7 critical coaching questions that will revolutionise the way you engage with your peers and those you currently manage (but will soon be coaching!) It doesn’t just span your working life, but I’ve found it has helped in my personal life too; e.g., when a friend confides in me and is looking for help or a sounding board.\n\nThe book is really quick to read. It’s concise enough that I didn’t find myself thinking, “yeah, yeah, I’ve got the reason why now get to how I improve in area x” yet it gave me enough that I felt I could go out and practice with it. One would have to be blind not to see the power in what is being said and in an era where there is enough momentum to confine ‘Command and control’ style leadership to the 80’s where it belongs, this book couldn’t be more timely.\n\nEquip yourself for the workplace of now and the future by reading this book. I’d also recommend you then read ‘Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization’ by David Logan et al.",
    "I've read many books in this review series, and many more that haven't made it to a review. I don't say these words lightly.\n\nTHIS IS POSSIBLY THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.\n\nSince I started my career in sales in my mid-20s, I've been fascinated with the power of a good coach. Although in my early call centre days I didn't realise it, I had a manager who was also coaching me. Properly coaching me by letting me find things out for myself. I didn't realise this was what he was doing until many years later and only after finishing this book (and writing these very words, if I'm being honest) did I realise that what could be perceived as laziness by some we worked with (Simon Miller, Ben Thurstan, Brett McKenna, Kirsty Wilson were all also coached by Colin) was actually highly effective coaching.\n\nAsking more questions is a great start to coaching but here Michael distills things down in to seven questions that will enable you to coach efficiently, effectively and (importantly) in a way that is low impact on you. Used regularly, in order, these seven questions will allow you to become a much more effective coach whilst putting a lot less pressure on yourself. The questions are labelled The Kick-start, The Awe, The Focus, The Foundation, The Lazy, The Strategic and The Learning questions. Each of the questions is backed by both illustrations of how to implement them but also by solid research on the science behind them.\n\nI've already started using some of these questions in my coaching sessions and they truly are brilliant. My biggest take away (one that's hard to implement at first) is to Tame The Advice Monster. I coach my team to listen more and talk less, yet as a coach I was very keen to solve problems FOR (or with) my team - rather than performing my proper job of allowing them to solve it themselves.\n\nMichael - kudos to you. I'm a new convert and evangelist.",
    "I've had this book since late 2017 and I'm halfway through reading it. I only wish I'd read it much sooner! I bought it at a time when I had plans to start some kind of coaching programme for clients of my accounting firm, but with no formal coaching skills or training I didn't know where to start. As it turns out, I spent 2018 laying the foundations in my firm for all other services which would free up my time to get into coaching.\n\nNow, in 2019, I am venturing into coaching with clients and other accountants and this book is exactly what I needed to face my challenge, to build a structure around coaching sessions and to give my clients clarity on how coaching works and what can be achieved if they commit to the structure of the programme.\n\nAn excellent, easy and practical read and suitable for anyone who wants to get into coaching themselves or others, or for managers looking to adopt a coaching habit with their team.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nMichael breaks down 7 critical coaching questions that will revolutionise the way you engage with your peers and those you currently manage (but will soon be coaching!) It doesn’t just span your working life, but I’ve found it has helped in my personal life too; e.g., when a friend confides in me and is looking for help or a sounding board.\n\nThe book is really quick to read.

One would have to be blind not to see the power in what is being said and in an era where there is enough momentum to confine ‘Command and control’ style leadership to the 80’s where it belongs, this book couldn’t be more timely.",
    "Great book. The 7 questions are practical and well explained.\n\nOnly criticism is formatting. How the coaching tips are mingled in with the 7 step process made it hard to follow. I feel like this was done to pad out the book, but it means there's an element of context switching. Also not sure why there was some \"hidden\" factor about the 7 questions. I'd rather just know them up front rather than have them \"slowly revealed'. Simple formatting that was meant clearly to spice up the book, but meant that it leaked some of the focus and simplicity it could have had.\n\nRegardless of the formatting, I got a lot from the content of the book."

    "While I know Ryan personally, I believe that I am uniquely qualified to review this book and, after reading a lot of the comments, add to the discussion. A lot of people miss that Ryan is articulating a journey and is translating it into something edible and powerful. Something 99% of us at ANY age cannot do, even with \"wisdom of experience\".\n\nStorytelling has been around since the beginning of time, but actual mass communication has been around for a very short time (relatively). It looks as if the \"paper book\" business will become a specialty- if surviving at all. I know that Ryan knows this as he has always been quick to lend an idea, do some digging and most important- analyze and decide. As he uses as an example in his book, he pulls an Amelia Earhart and ACTS. He can talk about Tesla in the same sentence as popular games on the meat markets in early Chicago. He has read (studied) Marshall McLuhan to Malcolm Gladwell. This rabid quest to find out and face his own soul searching path- has delivered a perfect book for the RIGHT PERSON. This is not Chicken Soup for the Soul.\n\nRyan has done WAY more and influenced WAY more decisions than he would ever talk about, but has helped untangle talent and communication complications (i.e- market properly) using many of his methods he developed under Robert Greene and even 50 Cent and Tucker Max. He helped in stealth, but in critical ways, to launch, maintain and capitalize on #1 Films, TV Shows, YouTube and MANY multi platinum musical artists. I can vouch for it myself.\n\nIt is always amazing to read a review somewhere when that person has never faced down rejection and fear and can criticize anyone for at least putting their thoughts and ideas out there for judgment. To do that, when the WORLD is telling you that finishing college is the only way to go and you have the same people close to you saying that you will fail- it truly was an Obstacle to overcome. It only got more intense for Ryan, but his lessons are earned. He was led to the water, but unlike most people, he drank. How can you question the message, integrity and courage of that? Steven Pressfield, one of our generations best and most diverse authors, has called it \"The Resistance\". Even he endorsees the book on the dust jacket.\n\nThe reason that I preface the review this way is to show you Ryan's true accomplishment here- articulating what he has learned, applying it to clear examples people can remember and also help people. There have been big choices in Ryan's life- not the least of which was whether to go in house for a safe \"job\" or \"bet on himself\". He DID what he talks about here. It is the true reflection on a part of his life and the methods HE used to combat them. This is especially important for a generation who \"has ADD\" and can't relate to the past. At 22- I think it would be silly to not monitor this refreshing voice and mind as he progress'. He actually went and spent time with Dr. Drew after reading his not so best selling books.\n\nMarcus Aurelius is the clear hero in this book, being compared to boxer \"Hurricane\" Carter (among others), while dealing with your internal power. The ideas and themes of the book seem to come from some Herman Hesse and Tom Wolfe as much as out of print magazines and long dead historical stars of their time. That is what is so attractive. Anyone should find a part of this to relate to. This is especially helpful to someone who wants a quick boost of intellect instead of trying to muscle through a biography (but he def refers to a lot of interesting people I need to read more about). Ryan does not rely on the same tired stereotyped figures from the past, but finds new, more relatable, characters and situations. Athletes, Entrepreneurs, Parents and CEO's, and those looking to look at life in a certain lens, will benefit greatly.\n\nThink you are having a bad day? Open your eyes and you will find out that another historical leader (other than Churchill) suffered severe depression while running the country that may or may not exist depending on his choices- Abraham Lincoln (didn't see a lot of that in the movie). Grant, Nietzsche and Edison all make a story about fortitude and acceptance. A much different approach than looking in a window and imaging you will get the new purse that is in there and moving on. Again- this is intended for action and not philosophy.\n\nSelf Help crap would be fine if it worked, but that means there would only be one book- and it would work. Awareness. Dealing with fear and uncertainty. Mindful and deliberate. Shame and guilt. Accountability and results. How did other people deal with this? Only through careful research do these stories become just as powerful to the man who believes that history is a verb as they are to someone just trying to make it through their day.\n\nThe point is- you are not alone. In fact, you are not even close to being the first person today to experience multiple obstacles. It is comforting to see how adversity has been confronted in the past. This is a book for those who believe in Realpolitik and seeing life for what it is. I would say it is the actual back up action plan to what a mystical book like the Mayan based best seller, \"The 4 Agreements\", is. Although the book is very much based on stoic principles it makes no judgements about your belief system in a macro way.\n\nI can see how this book can have some legs for people try to cope with a new world where you have too much or think you have too little- information to ingest. It is a reference book that can be returned to over and over.\n\nRyan Holiday is an important voice in the book space these days. Mostly because he is willing to actually commit to writing good books as well as growing his digital presence quickly. Non fiction at that age in 2014 is pretty impressive and patient. He can deal w Dov Charney, 50 Cent, Tucker Max and many others- due to his diversity. His \"Read to Lead\" mentality is refreshing and way more valuable than any class. He has a Best Seller in \"Growth Hacking\" at the same time, so holding his own with decades older armchair authors, while understanding the generation gap in communication is not such a bad way to describe this book.\n\nAnd finally...yes- he uses the bible as reference at times..",
    "No doubt, you are trying to get ahead in whatever ‘getting ahead’ means to you. But so often an obstacle seems to stand in your way. Yes, there are a few people who report having planned their charmed life or their business success and had it unfold almost exactly as planned, and with style and elegance. Amazing, but never true. Most people blocked by the obstacles of time, money, connections, opportunity and more, do nothing.\nThis book has a fascinating take on ‘being stuck’ – it is a primer on how to turn adversity to advantage, as the subtitle explains.\nLet me state upfront – I am bored by motivational talks and books. I find very little about them interesting or useful twelve hours later. This book is not a motivational text, though it is motivating as many good books are.\nThe “Ancient Art” of the subtitle is referring to the wisdom and insight of the Stoic philosophers. These writings or thoughts influenced all the people Holiday uses as examples of this approach to obstacles of life. The circumstances of these people would leave most disoriented, reactive, torn and even paralyzed. As Holiday shows “some seem to turn those very obstacles, which stymie us, into launching pads for themselves.”\nKnowing that there are heroes doesn’t help us to become heroes, but knowing how they became heroes, does. The value of this book is that it offers an ancient and profound method and framework for understanding, appreciating, and acting in the face of the obstacles life throws at us.\nTurning obstacles into the way forward takes many forms. For the great Athenian orator, Demosthenes, it was a relentless drive to improve himself through action and practice. For Abraham Lincoln it was humility, endurance, and compassionate will. In each case, all the people cited in this book were not born with the attributes it took to succeed, and many faced unimaginable horrors, from imprisonment to debilitating illnesses, and of course the day-to-day frustrations we all endure.\nSo, what did they do? “They had the ability to see obstacles for what they were, the ingenuity to tackle them, and the will to endure a world mostly beyond their comprehension and control,” Holiday explains.\nThe perspective is not a self-delusional, positive and happy one, ‘this is not so bad’, but rather, ‘I can make this good’.\nThe starting point is maintaining a state of mind that one of Holiday’s examples, the extraordinary businessman, John D. Rockefeller, had perfected: cool headedness and self-discipline.\nWhen America send the first astronauts into space, they trained them in one skill more than in any other: the art of not panicking. When people panic, they make mistakes. They just react, but not to what they need to react to, but to their survival hormones. At 150 miles above Earth, panic is suicide. Panic had to be trained out of the astronauts and it does not go easily. It must be trained away, through persistent, repeated attempts at not panicking, until you don’t.\nTalent isn’t the most important characteristic for success, grace and poise are, because these precede the opportunity to deploy your talent.\nThe action after the panic allows for a change of perception that is a prerequisite for right action. George Clooney spent his first years in Hollywood getting rejected at every audition. He desperately wanted the producers and directors to like him, and they didn’t. He blamed them for not seeing how good he was. His life changed when he changed perspective, from self-centredness to that of other-centeredness, not possible in panic mode.\nProducers need to find the right actor to cast in their film, and they all hope that the next person to walk into the room is the right actor. When Clooney realized that he was the answer to their prayers, not the other way around, his performance improved and so did his career.\nConsider the refusal to fund your company. I could be an obstacle, or a call for a change of action. Getting the person to fund you this isn’t up to you, but the decision to refine and improve your presentation is.\nConsider the number of exceptional businesses started during depressions or economic crises.\nFortune magazine was founded soon after the crash of 1929. Hewlett-Packard, and Revlon in the Great Depression. General Motors in the panic of 1907. Microsoft in the recession in 1973-75. LinkedIn during the burst of the dot-com bubble. Half the companies in the Fortune 500 were started under adverse conditions.\nRather than focus on the difficulties of an economy in free-fall, they focused on what they needed to do to succeed, and that produced the difference. This difference requires presence of mind.\nAndy Grove, former CEO of Intel, said “Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.” In like fashion, great individuals find a way to transform weakness into strength.\nThis is essentially a very practical book which will introduce you to a wealth of important ideas beyond what I have introduced in this column. They will be of extraordinary value as you try to facedown business crises.\n\nReadability Light --+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High -+--- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of the soon to be released ‘Executive Update’.",
    "Great book. I also recommend signing up for Ryan Holiday’s email newsletters as well as they are always very good, too. I had previously read his book “ego is the enemy”, but I found this book to be quite a bit better than that one. If you’re unfamiliar with his work, this would be a great book to start with.",
    "This had lots of good reviews and was recommended by a Stoic site, but I don't think it is worth having. I've read about half up to now and I'm losing interest, I doubt I'll finish reading it. Lots of heartwarming examples of people who were not actually Stoics but exhibited some form of Stoic behaviour don't really convince me that the author had anything useful to say. The book feels like he padded it out to make the word count, there's little in the way of original insights or things you didn't realise. The fact that he uses a lot of stories from American sports is something I personally find tedious, I have no idea who the people are or what he's writing about. I really dislike chapters that are three pages long. I also found his use of English was poor, it's not fluid, you constantly notice how he's expressed himself, rather than what he's said. Good English should be unobtrusive and flow from the page to the reader's mind without you noticing it.\n\nHe does explain the basics, so it's not a bad book to read if you have never encountered Stoic ideas before, but he doesn't seem to cover the subject in any depth. I'm waiting for him to introduce concepts like Eudaimonia and Apatheia, but this book reads too much like a self-help book for my taste. He's constantly offering military insights, not all of them accurate (The German attack on Poland in 1939 was a series of Kesselslachen, not Blitzkrieg). Lots of them are about American generals, quite a rich field where you can find many good examples, but after a quick introduction of Sherman (for example), he briefly discusses his personal qualities and he then moves on. Sherman wasn't a stoic (He was a Catholic as an adult), it's as if the author is trying to find things that can be used to support his views. Sherman was mired in controversy several times in his life and had a nervous breakdown in 1861. He was an effective general but not a good choice to support the book's narrative. This book is more like a magazine article or an essay written by someone who knows nothing about the subject but has researched it well on-line.\nThere are a lot of better books to read on the subject that offer more depth and better insights. I'd not recommend this book to anyone who showed any interest in the subject.",
    "Have you ever seen those ads on the internet? “Change your life today for only all of your money”. And you are taken to some badly written course outline that reeks of a pyramid scheme. The self help world is riddled with cons and Ryan Holiday is the latest addition.\n\nThe man is a tv marketer by background - he knows how to fool the masses. And he has somehow managed to get his online badly written life changing course printed.\n\nHe basically takes a few basic stoic concepts - don’t worry about what you can’t control, work hard, remain positive etc - and spin a book out of it. Throw in the names of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca along with some modern anecdotes and you are deemed a genius, according to a few people on the back (who clearly haven’t read the book or are part of the self help pyramid scheme)\n\nThe anecdotes themselves are horribly cliché. Just name drops people that everyone will know such as Edison, Lincol, Eisenhower, the Lakers (marketing 101 - don’t lose your audience). The bits and bobs of history are so basic and sometimes just wrong - I’m not sure he even bothered to google some of it.\n\nThe attempts at motivation amount to little other than “are you ready to go to work? Let’s get to work!”\n\nThe writing is blatantly dreadful and nauseating “Lincoln possessed an inner mental fortress that girdered him” Jesus.\n\nIt might seem like a good book if you are under 20 and haven't read any self help books before but if you’ve ever read any few before this, you will be quite disappointed with this.",
    "I had high expectations for this book which it didn't quite live up to. Ryan Holiday opens this book and bases his narrative around a quote by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which indicates there are 3 critical steps to overcoming an obstacle: (i) perspective, (ii) action and (iii) will/perseverance.\n\nThe book is then subsequently sectioned into 3 parts on (i) perspective, (ii) action and (iii) will/perseverance. Each part is divided into roughly 8-10 sub sections. Each sub section is several pages long and offers one key insight. e.g. perspective can be objective/subjective or perspectives create opportunities etc etc.\n\nThe book uses anecdotes of successful historical figures to validate ideas which includes the use of Politicians (Lincoln, Roosevelt), Athletes (Hurricane Carter), George Clooney to name a few. There is also many references to Stoic philosophers (Epictetus, Demosthenes, Marcus etc).\n\nOverall I agreed mostly with the proposition of the book. I didn't however believe that the anecdotes supply sufficient reasoning to argue these points. It felt that the author cherry-picked case-studies to fit his narrative.\n\nI also tended to find the writing style was slightly awkward and a lot of sentences were of this nature: \"leadership requires determination, energy and courage\" which by itself often seemed irrelevant. The author also feels the need to use 2 descriptive words at all instances, e.g. \"It's easier to persist in our efforts and actions than to endure the uncomfortable or the painful\"\n\nFurthermore, if the reader has read about Stoicism before (e.g. The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by Irvine) then much of the Stoic ideas are recycled. For an introduction to Stoicism with logical arguments I would recommend Irvine (5* read).\n\nTo conclude I feel the overall idea is good. This book will be useful for anyone who has to deal with adverse circumstances. It will appeal to people who prefer anecdotes over reasoning.",
    "I have both the audio book and the paper copy of this book. I first got the audio book and thought somehow the content sounded just plain repetitive - different words same message; so thought I'd read the book instead so that I can follow it with more attention. But it transpired that page after page after page may have been filled by the author with words but it is repetition, repetition, and yet more repetition of the message behind the content. If that was deliberate then well done to the author, he nailed it. For those readers and seekers of wisdom (or better understanding of stoicism) find and stick to a good translation of Meditations book of Marcus Aurelius instead; that's where you'll find the originality.",
    "I'm no expert on Stoic philosophy but my understanding of it was that can help us be more calm and resilient. Holiday repackages it into some kind of motivation way to make money in order to be successful. The likes of Marcus Aurelious and Seneca would turn in their graves if their philosophy was compared to unscrupulous business owners like John D Rockefellar. He thinks that just by inserting Stoicism on the front cover and a load of philosophical quotes, he can verify his message. He often power phrases these quotes so that he can subtly twist their meaning to suit his own narrative. His main message seems to be that other people are our enemies and they must be vanquished at all costs. I can imagine someone like Patrick Bateman (American Psycho) or Hitler, before invading Poland, lapping this up. Okay Hitler was a bit extreme. He also often contradicts himself, for example we should never give up, but a few pages later, we should never be wedded to a position or some things in life are bigger than us. We should not worry if our actions limit or hurt others and then we should consider their feelings. We need to take urgent action and then we shouldn't be in a hurry. He also randomly mentions we can control what we desire....\nHe also says we should ignore our feelings and perceptions. While I agree that we should be skeptical of our feelings as they can be unhelpful, we should from time to time at least try to understand where they come from. His approach seems to be to bury our heads in the sand, this seems like the road to toxic masculinity. He likes a bit of good old fashioned male bravado, life is a race and you have to win.\nHe doesn't take into account simple bad luck and other variables and simply repeats page after page that we need to tackle our problems. We do, but there are other things at play.\nFor example if our boss asks something unfeasible at work we shouldn't question it, just put our head down and work harder. Working harder seems to be his main tip for a better life, making him sound like Boxer from Animal Farm. Don't question authority or the status quo, just shut up and get on with it. I can imagine what he thinks of protests like BLM.\nThere are some useful tips however, such as approach obstacles as an opportunity to practice a virtue, such as patience, forgiveness or courage and that we are in control of how we react to our problems. Also we are all guilty of procrastination at times and could benefit from more action. I agree that life is hard and often things contradict themselves. (I'm doing it in this review)\nI agree that a degree of anxiety is required in every life but Holiday's approach will have people slitting their wrists and having sky high blood pressure all over the place. He's reinforcing a dog eat dog world where there has to winners and losers. If you're not the next Steve Jobs, cunningly defeating your enemies and taking all the credit, you're a failure and should be ashamed for not working harder. Something Seneca will help us come to terms with a million times better than Holiday."

    "Robert Greene does it once again,as far as discerning the psyche of the inhabitants of Earth,with a book that uses historical references to drive home a point made about the proclivities of people. Many points made in this book bear the ring of truth,when one simply thinks back and references their very own life-experiences. One observation in this excellent book ALONE made it worth the price of purchase!! \"Remember ,people don't do something only ONCE;they will inevitably REPEAT their behavior.\" This was true with a purportedly honest,pious and innocent cousin of mine who pilfered an expensive merino wool winter cap which came as a set with matching merino wool sweater. I thought this nadir deed was simply a solitary lapse in her veracity,as she likely felt one of her sons would appreciate having such a quality hat,but that nadir act was followed by subsequent purloinings,by this mendacious madam,who receives the sympathy and\"defense\"of the family as a whole because both of her parents have\"gone over to the majority\"and she undertook the raising of her deceased sisters two daughters. Oh,boo,hoo,because the ONLY person to tread this vile,accursed planet to ever make me feel as though I MATTERED,is no more,yet I never used that tragic occurrence to attain sympathy from relatives,but just steeled and STILLED my mind and moved forward with my life armed WITH the advice on surviving in life,that was imparted to me prior to my sires demise. This nadir knaves latest nefarious deed was purloining a birthday card with sweet sentiments from a friend I hadn't heard from in a quarter of a CENTURY,which arrived at my domicile in a box containing TWO-DOZEN roses(one for EVERY year we'd been estranged)and a cute,tawny teddy bear!! Unaware that evil had usurped the person she formerly was(or pretended to be)after READING the sweet card IN my presence,she put on the \"pitiful\"face which has worked for her since little Amy Carter romped around the White House during the Jimmy Carter Administration,and stated:\"I'm going to GO and read this back in your mothers room.\" Never even SUSPECTING this purportedly devout believer was PLANNING from the moment she read my special card,to take it WITH her to read at her leisure,since she often talks of liking love songs and romantic movies,but never being able to experience such in her tumultuous relationships!!! 8 minutes later emerging from my mothers bedroom,as I am engrossed in finishing chapter 7 of my third book:\"On 7th Thought\"she briskly skips straight out the front door without a WORD spoken to me!! My acute-intuition(which operates neither on reputation of another or logic)told me:STOP her Ant;she STILL has your card!!\" But(as usual,and always to my regret)I allowed my conscious/\"reasoning\"mind to tell me that hopnest,innocent,naive\"Harper\"would never just TAKE a priceless birthday card from YOU!! After my acute Nonconscious mind won this debate,I arose from my PC to see this treacherous cousin backing out of the driveway,so,since she,in her hurry to get\"in the wind\"hadn't even rolled the window up on the drivers side,so I yelled:WHAT did you do with my CARD?!?\" She leans her drawn and haggard face out the window and replies:\"I don't KNOW!!\" I immediately started down the porch stairs with:\"What do you mean you DON'T know?!?\"as she hits the accelerator,zooms back to the middle of the street,turns north and speeds into the distance!!! Avoiding my society for 2 MONTHS made me totally forget her bizarre conduct,and so I asked her what became of my card she insisted on reading in my mothers room,and she resorted to the\"self-pity card\"as usual,pretending to be\"hurt\"by my inquiry,nearly in tears saying I always blame HER when something of mine vanishes!! So,falling for this ruse,I said apologeticaly:\"I didn't SAY you took it;\n\nI only want to know what became OF it when you exited my mothers room with it. Exploiting my ravaged memory after multiple brain surgeries that resulted in a quarter of my frontal temporal lobe being tossed into the garbage,she SMILED reassuringly,looked me dead in the eye with:\"I gave it right BACK to you,outside of the kitchen remember?!? Remember? REMEMBER?!?\" I fell,hook,line and sinker for her mendacity,until a week or two later I had a TOTAL recall,and remembered that she NEVER handed me my special card back TO me,as WOULD have been the case had Satan not entered into her at an unspecified date in 1998,but that she inexplicably exited the house with a:\"Nice card.\",\"Gotta go.\",\"Be right back.\",\"See you in a little while.\"or ANYthing,but straight to her car,JUST as she INTENDED to do all along!! Now,the extended family is trying to make it seem that I'M the one who sinned,by being UNpleased with the loss of a card that I would've added to my lifetime scrapbook of precious memories,as my uncle quips:\"The Bible says forgive her.\" I replied:\"I WILL ,when she returns my card,since God Himself doesn't forgive until you ASK forgiveness and REPENT(turn from evil)and a price is paid FOR you transgressions!! Your precious niece,has neither yet ADMITTED to her black deed against me,nor,as a result asked for my pardon,so I'll try to forgive,but I can NEVER ever truly TRUST her again!! It's like this uncle;if you take a clean,white,crisp,sharp-edged sheet of paper,with the\"new paper\"SMELL,and proceed to crumple/BALL-it-up,you can lay it flat on a table and attempt to smooth it over,by running your palm across it 78 THOUSAND times over the span of a YEAR,but it will NEVER beethe same as it was BEFORE you \"betrayed\"/crumpled-it-up;the\"evidence\"of the crumpling/\"betrayal\"will still be perceptible with the tiny,folds,wrinkles and irregularities which can NEVER be righted!! And of course you know the Bible states that if we WILLFULLY sin,after being spiritually washed,there remains NO room for forgiveness!! So since your backslidden bald-headed niece willfully took my card when she had a CHANCE to return it to me when I asked her what did she do with it,but elected to remain in her treachery,there remaineth NO room for forgiveness in \"Anthon the Zappers\"heart!!\" This book addresses my aforementioned experience with human nature and MORE within it's prodigious pages!! This is an indespensible work,if you wish to prepare yourself against the baseness of Mans innate proclivities. My sagacious sire paraphrased about half of this book,over the decades while preparing me for life in a high-population DENSITY metropolis like Le' Strait,as its called in French. He accurately informed me:\"Don't waste a SECOND worrying about what people SAY about you when you aren't present,because people have ALREADY made-UP their mind HOW they WANT to perceive you AT first SIGHT,no matter what the truth of the matter is!! People are going to THINK what they WANT to think about you!! So you would be a pathetic FOOL,for losing a night of sleep,or a MOMENT of peace over what another may think OR say about you!!\" Chapter 1:Mastering Your Emotional Self is a lesson my sire continually impressed upon me. Working on an arduous job,shoulder-to-shoulder 12 hours a day,7 days a week with the man whose very PRESENCE caused me to BLOAT with pride and self-assurance,caused a lot of the men working with us to lose their cool and EXPLODE in anger at a foreman or co-worker,so my sire taught me to keep my composure and poise,at all times,but especially when it would feel good TO\"unload\"pent-up passion on another. Right when he perceived,I was at my\"breaking-point\"he would smile and cackle:\"Don't make an ass of yourself;don't make an ass of yourself!!\" I also learned that the first thing TO do when you are angry is to REALIZE you ARE so. Chapter 3:See Through Peoples Masks is an endeavor I've been successfully embarking on since the 3rd grade at Clara S. Barton Elementary in west-central Detroit,as people are NEVER satisfied with what they truly ARE,so they enlist upon the task of erecting a FACADE which they feel will impress those they have discourse with. People would rather cultivate the society of total strangers before they will DARE to abide with their OWN vacuous,deranged personality,which is like unto deliberately entering into a horrid,ghastly NIGHTMARE!! It is this very aversion which makes the club-scene,concerts and other crowded venues SO popular!! On the whole people ABHOR who they really are,and will do ANYthing to avoid an encounter with Themselves!! I was also versed on chapter7:Soften Peoples Resistance by Confirming Their Self-opinion with:\"These off-balanced broads out here get manipulated and\"ran-through\" by these jack-legged jokers out here,because they simply TELL these dim broads everything they WANT to hear!!\" chapter10:Beware The Fragile Ego is a dialogue on the most insidious aspect of human nature:ENVY,which the Bible asserts as potent with:\"Wrath is cruel.anger is OUT rageous;but WHO is ABLE to stand before ENVY?!?\" Chapter 10 even lists the\"leakage\"of envy that is perceptible in the face of one who inwardly harbors a SAVAGE hatred of your qualities with the shocking:\"Signs of Envy\"where the look of ones eyes who detests you because of your innate character is like that of a child who feels cheated. Something I experienced in 1982 at my churchs' Vacation Bible School lent credence to an assertion under\"Signs of Envy\"was:\"People who are envious cannot HELP feeling GLEE when they hear of the bad luck/misfortune(or a loss suffered by)of those they envy. As the awards were being announced for each age-group of children,I stood(legitimately,not pridefully by ANY stretch of the imagination)confident that I'd doubtless secured the award for\"Best Student\",by a LONG-shot,but the awards emcee announced:\"And the winner for\"Best Student Ages 10-12 is...…………….Mark Jones!!!\" I stood in utter SHOCK,as even the teacher of my class shook HER head slowly in disbelief at this gross injustice,but someone who inwardly resented my cognition,eyed me from across the width of the entire sanctuary,as he slowly made his way toward me,smile widening as he drew closer,until a few feet from me,he jogged right up TO me,pointed his finger right in-between my welling eyes,threw his head BACK as he loudly,LAUGHED with UNholy GLEE,at the sight of me psychologically devastated by a criminally-wrong slight for an honor I NO doubt fully deserved,but unaware that the awards were being given NOT by MERIT,but by attendance,and my mother being a working single parent with four progeny,was called-in to work one evening,so I missed a day,but the PASTOR(who is expected to be present perpetually) and his brood,were in attendance EVERYday,and so his kids SWEPT the award for\"Best Student\"in every age group. Chapter 4:Determine the Strength of Peoples Character,becomes an easy-enough task,when one who touted their piety will LASH-out at another with a TYPHOON of profanity,at the merest suspicion of a contrary opinion on the part of another!! I also perceive that when one speaks extremely harshly yo another it was NOT something that came out in the\"heat-of-the-moment,but rather something they had LONG felt about the victim of their verbal venom,and ire caused them to throw caution,decorum and restraint to the jet-stream. chapter 4 asserts:\"Others can SEE patterns in the psychological addict,but the adsdic them self doesn't because NO one wants to believe THEY are operating UNDER a compulsion,totally BEYOND their control. It is TOO disturbing a thought.\"Guilty as charged,because of exposure to salacious material at NINE years-old,I had a life-long pitched battle with my libido,until my beloved sire,with the last words he uttered on this vile Earth charged me to:\"NEVER let\"something\"get SUCH an hold over on you,that you'll KEEP doing it,even thought you KNOW it's doing nothing BUT dragging you down DEEPER into its web.\" I vowed to him I wouldn't but unknown to me,I already WAS,so all I could do from that point was to REVERSE the effects of this thralldom by sheer strength of MIND!! And this I DID for the most part,being the 1ST-magnitude cognitionist I became at birth because of the impartation of cognition my sire bequeathed me with!! This is a profound,practical and preter-prudent book!! I learned a lot about Howard Hughes I wasn't previously aware of!! I am SO glad I didn't heed the many reviews that stated it not being on par with the prior books by Mr. Greene,but listened to my acute-intuition,and purchased it!! I forsee MANY days of loading my mind/\"lethal weapon\" with the psychological\"ammunition\"this book wields.\n\n'",
    "The Laws of Human Nature is one of the best books I've read on this intriguing subject. The subject of us - our inner selves. The deep insights, the detailed stories, the structure of the material is incredibly well-done. I learned more about myself in this book than through any other books, assessments, or personality quizzes. I highly recommend this book to everyone who truly wants to know the good, the bad, and the ugly about who you are as a person. Be prepared to read and reread...it's so rich with insight, research, and wisdom.",
    "Good book for those who believe",
    "Robert Greene’s “The Laws of Human Nature” may be the best book I have read in a long time and if I had my way would be a textbook in every high school in America. I feel that way because it lays out a comprehensive guide for the way we think and behave. He mixes philosophy with ancient wisdom and recent events to help us understand the 18 laws that guide us.\n\nEach section begins my explaining the ‘law’, then shares a story from that supports the theory. He summarizes what we have learned and shares strategies on how we can build our skills or improve our behavior in each area.\n\nHere are Greene’s laws with my one sentence summaries:\n\nThe Law of Irrationality – How our emotions lead us to bad decisions and create negativity in our lives.\n\nThe Law of Narcissism – Why people are narcissists and how they can be dangerous.\n\nThe Law of Role-playing – The impact of hiding our true personalities.\n\nThe Law of Compulsive Behavior – People fall into the trap of repeating bad behaviors.\n\nThe Law of Covetousness – Why we want what we don’t have.\n\nThe Law of Shortsightedness – Why we overreact to short term situations and ignore the long-term.\n\nThe Law of Defensiveness – We resist when people are trying to change our minds, yet we look for opportunities to change others.\n\nThe Law of Self-sabotage – If you change your attitude who can avoid problems that you will face.\n\nThe Law of Repression – Be cautious of your dark side. We all have one.\n\nThe Law of Envy – Because people are naturally envious, you need to work to draw attention away from yourself and develop your own self-worthy but the way you view yourself.\n\nThe Law of Grandiosity – A little success goes to our head. It is wise to be realistic when looking at your own accomplishments.\n\nThe Law of Gender Rigidity – We are born with male and female genes, but as we grow older, we repress parts of our traits. This is to our own detriment.\n\nThe Law of Aimlessness – When you have a sense of purpose, you will be more successful.\n\nThe Law of Conformity – We act differently when we are in groups. We are more likely to take risks when we feel the support of those around us.\n\nThe Law of Fickleness – Authority results from creating the appearance of power and when others see you as a leader.\n\nThe Law of Aggression – Recognize the signs of our repressed frustrations and anger and learn to tame them.\n\nThe Law of Generational Myopia – As you grow up you identify with others from your generation, but when you get older these attitudes prevent you from being open to the ideas of others not in your group.\n\nThe Law of Death Denial – We spend a lot of our lives avoiding the subject of our own death. But as we accept it, we enjoy more aspects of our life.\n\nRead this book.",
    "Human nature, since the existence of men, is a hot topic shrouded by critical inquiry and analysis. What motivates us? What makes some float in negative bubbles and make others grow tall in positivity? There’s no one answer. Humans are fallible.\n\nAfter six years of research on the subject of human nature, Robert Greene places his findings in a new gem, The Laws of Human Nature. He advises us, with copious historical examples, to let go of our tendency to judge people but rather to open our mind to seeing people in a new light.\n\nWhy six years?\n\nIn a digital age, where one could get books written in seconds, why would Greene choose to spend six years working on a book?\n\nFirst, and this is my guess, Greene uses absence to create respect (Law 16 in The 48 Laws of Power). Second, he understands the dangers of not saturating the market with quantity but rather with quality books. With five classical books under his belt, he surely doesn't need to increase his reputation by publishing anything of mediocre quality.\n\nWhat’s more important, Greene’s books are well researched. And good research in any subject takes time. The book speaks for itself.\n\nTell me more about the book…\n\nAny Greene fan knows his books are punctuated with anecdotes. The Laws of Human Nature follows suit—in a typical Greenian structure—historical analogies, important keys and explicit summaries.\n\nWhether or not Greene’s books should be found in the self-help shelves is a moot point. That said, The Laws of Human Nature, carries within it that motivational undertone. In Law 8 (Change Your Circumstances by Changing Your Attitude), for example, the author gives away free hint that helps the reader to elevate their minds from current realities. This is something you’d find in Jack Cranfield book, The Success Principles(2004). In this bright chapter, he advices us to go though life by understanding that attitude colours our perceptions. With example of the Russian author, Anton Chekov, the reader is reminded that life is what he/she desires it to be. These little sprinklings some would argue is un-Greene-like. Sentences like “get in the habit of writing your dreams down and pay deep attention to their feeling tone” would read strange to those who only see Greene as that Machiavellian lecturer. However, I would personally argue that this is refreshing.\n\nIn addition, his past works, especially Arts of Seduction(2001), Mastery(2012) and 33 Strategies of War(2006) stream into the pages of The Laws of Human Nature. Especially the part of self-mastery which is a strong thematic feature in Greene’s works. In Laws of Human Nature he reminds us to gauge our strengths and weaknesses and work on annihilating those weaknesses. Knowing ones character will help one in breaking what he calls “compulsive patterns”. However, our ability to find them in others puts us on another pedestal as we are able to sniff false fronts in this social media age. He reminds us that we must avoid weak characters as they are prone to quenching the good qualities an individual might possess. These individuals are enumerated in the toxic types, including but not limited to: the big talker, the personalizer, the pampered prince/princess. Anyone who has read Strategies of War would see some of these advice as a reminder.\n\nWhat’s more, Greene has the capability to paint pictures in simple sentences. For example, on in Elevate Your perspectives (law 6)\nHe quips:\n“In a world that is complex, with myriad dangers that loom in the future, our short term tendencies pose a continual threat to our well-being and as our attention spans decrease because of technology, the threat is even greater. In many ways we are defined by our relationship to time. When we simply react to what we see and hear, when we swing from excitement and exuberance to fear and panic at each new piece of dramatic news, when we hear our actions toward gaining as much pleasures as possible in the moment without a thought for future consequences, we can say that we are giving in our animal nature, to what is primitive and potentially destructive in our neurological makeup.” (Greene, 2018:161). Such paragraphs leaves us with moments to reflect on contemporary nature of human coexistence.\n\nFor further discussion:\n\nOn Narcissistic Spectrum, Greene argues that another level of narcissism exist in entrepreneurs and “for many of these leader types,” he argues that their instability and chaos will be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They cannot forge a coherent structure or organisation. Everything must flow through them.” (Greene,2018:46) This argument is double edged: on one hand, he argues that they can’t build organisations. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, just to mention these three come to mind here. Although these business icons fall under this spectrum but one could argue that they created companies and, sometimes, coherence exists. Narcissism carries its own advantages and perhaps, it needs to be buoyed for one to know how to use it one's satisfaction.\n\nWhy Four Stars?\n\nAs a Greene fan, I would have loved to make this five stars. But, in comparison to his other works, I don’t think The Laws of Human Nature has that sharpness the other books carry. However, I’d still recommend it to friends who are particularly interested in finding the self and understanding the human in others.\n\nConclusion\n\nWell, Greene, as always in his works, leaves the reader to take his work as it is or leave it. Explaining a lot and leaving the audience to do the thinking themselves. There are a lot of open ended advices in the book but, overall, the book delivers it's message and shines a new light on features of human nature.\n******\nAs Greene convalesces (after suffering from a fatal stroke), I wish him speedy recovery and more importantly, I’d give a piece of advice from his book: “people can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower.” I hope he recovers quickly.",
    "Firstly, I must start off by saying that I am a great fan of Robert Greene and have waited for this book for nearly 2 years. And the reason for me picking up this book was mainly to understand other people and to protect myself from some of the bad people there can be. But honestly, the book was a revelation to me. The book is FAR more than just understanding others; to me at least, it helped me introspect myself and understand myself and my behaviours on a more deeper level. I'm a young person and want to be a really good mother when I have a child. This book clearly showed me how our own parents' behaviour can affect the way we deal with our children. If you have had bad parents, you at least become aware of your behavioural pattern that could affect your children and try to correct yourself.\n\nAnd other than introducing yourself to you, it also helps you understand other people's character based on their behavioural pattern. One major change I have observed in Mr. Greene's writing is that in 48 Laws, the major theme was people would consciously try to harm you. But here in this new book, he goes on to say that most of the times, they might not even do it consciously. I really loved that concept as that is the reality.\n\nMr. Greene is one of the greatest interpreters of human behaviour ever. Thank you so much sir for such a great piece of writing. Reading this book was more of a spiritual experience to me.",
    "As soon as I heard of this book I ordered it immediately since I am familiar with Robert Greene's previous work 'The 48 Laws of Power'.\n\nThere is so much to learn from this book. This tells you all the things to look out for in others as well as yourself.\nThe end result is you begin to analyse people and you learn to deal with them better.\n\nThe structure of the book is brilliant. Each chapter is like the following:\n- First he tells the story of a historical figure displaying certain human characteristics.\n- An interpretation of the story and events.\n- Followed by 'The Keys to Human Nature' as to how and why we display such traits.\n- And then it tells you ways of dealing with people who have the aforementioned characteristsics and see how you can find them in yourself.\n\nIt says at the back \"You are about to become an apprentice in human nature.\" Indeed.\nThis is something you can refer to again and again. When you study each chapter and analyse yourself, you begin to see things in yourself that you weren't even aware of. Once you spot the human traits within you, you start to see them in others and this is where you think of strategies of dealing with people. This is what makes the book so enlightening.\n\nIt is very hard to look in the mirror and admit your flaws. But what really pays off is once you acknowledge your weaknesses, you become stronger, and a better person. Robert Greene writes in a friendly manner that makes you feel like you are taking advice from a wise teacher.\n\nThis book has improved my life. In fact it's getting better at understanding myself and the people around me.\nHighly recommend.",
    "If you want to achieve something worth while in your life then this book is for you. This book is placed under self help genre but relies intensely on psychology. If you have read Robert Greene’s previous works then this one is the best so far. Robert Greene has maintained his trademark style in his new book. Each chapter gets better than the previous one. It’s important that you apply what you read to get the results. You might encounter some repeated lessons from his previous books but it will be only to support some things he wants to convey.\nOnce you study the book thoroughly your perspective will change definitely about people and yourself. You will be able to predict people’s moves and also why they act the way they do. You will save time and energy from small as well as grave mistakes you might have committed. And last but not the least you will be able to turn the tables in any adverse situations.",
    "Das Buch an sich ist gut aufgebaut und geschrieben. Die Struktur ist immer die gleiche - ein historisches Beispiel, die Interpretation dessen und wie man die Erkenntnisse daraus in das moderne, alltägliche Leben integrieren kann. Die Prämisse ist durchaus interessant.\n\nPositiv:\n- Schreibstil (ist Geschmackssache, mir hat er gefallen)\n- Aufbau und Struktur\n- die Idee mit der Einleitung jedes Kapitels durch ein historiches Beispiel\n\nNegativ:\n- die Quellen - teilweise extrem veraltet\n- dementsprechend sind auch viele der Infos auf nicht belegten Thesen gestützt\n- er benutzt oft als \"Beleg\" die Aussage von Psychoanalytikern (z.B. Jung und Mahler). Das große Problem der Psychoanalyse ist, dass deren Aussagen weder als falsch, noch als richtig belegt werden können. Das Buch ist somit nicht wissenschaftlich fundiert.\n- als Zusatzpunkt zu dem Oberen: er scheint ganz bewusst \"Belege\" rauszusuchen, die seinen eigenen Standpunkt untermauern, anstatt seine Aussagen differenzierter/aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln zu betrachten - das Ganze lässt es daher nicht wie \"Gesetze\" aussehen, sondern eher \"meine persönlichen Meinungen, die ich mich Pseudowissenschaft untermauere\"\n- und ganz besonders negativ, weswegen ich nur einen Stern gebe: in der Einleitung zu seinem Buch bestreitet er genau das und behauptet bei seinen Thesen auf neuste Erkenntnisse der Wissenschaft (z.B. von Kahnemann) zurückzugreifen (was nur bei den wenigsten Kapiteln der Fall ist)\n\nRundum keine Empfehlung."

    "I have been on a journey to learn more about persuasion and behavioral psychology and Dr. Cialdini really shows us not only where persuasion tactics are used but also the underlying reason for efficacy.\n\nIf you are a marketer, copywriter, or just feel you are a pushover for salesmen. I highly recommend the book.\n\nIt will guide marketers and copywriters to understand the reasoning for some of the things that have been around forever while also helping clarify the boundaries for healthy sales and persuasion vs unethical persuasion.\n\nIf you (like me) found yourself questioning why you just made this purchase or agreed to something you are not thrilled about, then this will arm you with not only things to look out for but real strategies for avoiding them.",
    "I've enjoyed Dr. Cialdini's works and this book is solid. The framework of showing all the \"influences\" you can have is great but it's sorta exhausting to read. Could have been tighter, more focused, and more sharpened towards recognizing and using influences. But, it is a very good book, just not great.",
    "Imagine a long, narrow, trench that goes on for a hundred miles in a straight line. It's just wide enough for you to walk in and filled with thick, dark mud that comes up to your thighs. Scattered intermittently along the base of this trench are small little scatterings of valuable gems. The only way to find them is to feel the sharp edges under your feet as you trudge along.\n\nYou could get out, and race ahead a few miles. After all, you've got a list that gives you a rough idea of where the next scattering of slightly different gems can be found. But there's a good chance you might miss some small treasure if you do.\n\nThat's what this book is. At best, 50 pages worth of truly useful information scattered and buried throughout 500+ pages of useless, exhausting muck. There is really great stuff in here, but reading to find it feels a bit like a burden... or a chore.\n\nThe author claims this book is written in \"a nonacademic, conversational style\". If you want to make the argument the author succeeded, you'll still need to be prepared for the most boring conversation of your life. One which you were forced to listen to for an hour, but only spend 5 minutes summarizing for your friends (if you're a good friend).",
    "Love this book. Still digesting it! Loaning it to other people and waiting for it to come back all the time.\nIt’s BIG in size and information.\nI’ve read many psychology books, self help books, books about people. I really knew nothing! I am amazed. I had no idea!\nThere is a whole new world out there that most people know nothing about and the people who do… may be using it against you!\nGet educated!!!\nAnd enjoy!",
    "I rarely give reviews but I have to give one to this book. I felt like he used the principles in the book to influence my decision to finish this book in a short period. The case studies are brilliant.",
    "I am in the field of marketing and purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my webinar trainers. I am so happy that I bought it! I am a little more than halfway through it and already I find the book is worth it’s weight in gold! After reading the book this far I am inclined to suggest it for EVERYONE regardless of whether you are in the field of sales and marketing or not.\n\nThis is a great book for all consumers to read because everyone is subjected to sales media and marketing every day, and this book is valuable for the little tricks you need to know when you’re buying anything, listening to the news media, selling personal items at a garage sale, online, or through a newspaper. No one should buy a house or a car without first reading this book because there are many tactics that are used against you in such a subtle and ingenious way that the majority of people have no idea about. I have four adult children who have families and I am inclined to purchase the book for each of their households to read, including their older children who are subjected daily whether in school, watching TV or other media, or interested in making a purchase somewhere. This should be mandatory reading for every high school and college student.\n\nI very HIGHLY recommend this book as a must read for everyone, and save it as a valued reference, and to re-read!",

    "500 pages with hundreds of published references, read over three days while on vacation. A gold mine of information on how we are subtly manipulated nearly every day without our awareness, and useful, suggested counter–measures. After reading Cialdini's latest edition, I realized that my psychopathic neighbor used Cialdini's tricks to weasel out of his oral agreement with me. I'm sadder but wiser thanks to Cialdini.",
    "I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this book and am so disappointed with it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as it is a pretty expensive book and contains about 5 or so interesting case studies at max.\n\nWhilst I appreciate the thought and knowledge that has gone into writing this book, it is so, so dated. Many of the examples and case studies presented to make a point are in no way relevant to the present day and I am going to assume this book is aimed at an American audience (and not a British audience). For example, there is discussion of tactics salespeople use to persuade buyers to make a purchase at Tupperware parties and for door to door sales (FYI a lot of it is about peer pressure). However, none of those are relevant to me because I'm younger and 99% of my purchases are done online. I just felt like so much of the book was completely irrelevant. It helped me better understand the tactics salespeople have used in the past and why they worked, but here was very little reference to how we are influenced by things today and the impact of doing pretty much everything online. I also couldn't see how a lot of the book could be applied to the world of work (which is primarily why I bought it).",
    "I believe most of the tricks about the influence the author mentions in the book are quite well-known by most people. This book is filled with stories and examples that support the POV of the writer, of which some are actually not that strong. It could be 80% thinner and we can still get all the ideas the author is talking about.",
    "Cialdini provides the professionalism and scientific rigour of Kahneman with the fun and accessibility of Gladwell.\nHaving read an early edition of ‘Influence’ I was surprised not least at the difference in the sizes of the books. This book builds significantly on the contents of the previous editions.\nCialdini is an academic, a practical field researcher and a master at translating some complex psychological phenomena in to accessible and easily understood principles.\nNot only does this book add a new principle ’unity’ that was not part of the original text, but he also devoted a healthy section of each section on how to identify and if necessary offer resistance to the principles when they are being used against you.\nThere are a range of examples and anecdotes to illustrate the points being made. From there it’s up to you as the reader and you can consider how you may be able to make use of these principles ethically in your personal or professional life.\nIf you have ever heard yourself say, I like people watching, psychology fascinated me or ‘why did he/she do that’ then this book could shine a light of understanding into your world. You may even learn something about yourself.",
    "I have read his previous book. Writer’s revised version packed with up to date information and warning sign for not to get conned by conned artist. Everybody should have a copy of this book. Say no to exploiters.",
    "If you want to understand better how the human psyche works and how are manipulated by small tricks, this is the book to read. Easy to read, great examples and it will make you understand why you ended up buying that blender that you really didn't need."

    "This is an insightful book about navigating through life. It is at times a bit redundant and a bit hard to follow, but with effort the reader can garner a great many thought provoking ideas about how we can better function as individuals, as parents, as friends, and in the workplace.\n\nThe author’s fundamental message is that the basic need of humans is connection–it is why we are here- and that real connection only comes through exposing and accepting our vulnerabilities. She defines vulnerability as “uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure” , love probably being the best example. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings with those who have earned the right to hear them–those with whom we have built a true level of trust. This circle of confidants is, for most people, quite small, limited to family and the closest of friends. Indeed, as I read I had to think of those every few people who I could truly trust, not just to keep confidences, but to accept my admission of vulnerability and help me move forward and perhaps try new approaches without being judgmental. The author notes how this kind of trust is a product of vulnerability and requires work and full engagement. I also thought, particularly later when she talked about children and young people, whether they had the ability to find such a trusting friend among their peers. Young people can be so fickle and also so cruel, and are rarely mature enough to recognize the harm that their words and actions produce. A parent can offer the maturity, and the unconditional love necessary for trust, but children, particularly as they age, have a heightened reluctance to bring parents within their circle of trust. The author speaks more to this when she turns specifically to parenting.\n\nSince connection is so important, disconnection is a great fear. The author defines shame as the fear of disconnection. Shame is also the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing we are flawed and thus unworthy of love and belonging. I felt that her definition of shame was the fear of “not measuring up”. She characterizes the difference between shame and guilt as the difference between thinking “I am bad”, as opposed to thinking “I did something bad”. Although this may seem at first blush like semantics, a second look, especially when dealing with children, shows that it is a distinction with a difference. The basic thrust of the book is being able to work through shame, as opposed to hiding from it or otherwise deflecting it without facing it head on. She describes this as “shame resilience”, the ability to recognize shame and understand its triggers, to practice critical awareness to move through the experience without sacrificing values, and to come through the experience with more courage, compassion and empathy. She again stresses sharing our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding. If we can do so, then shame can’t survive.\n\nWhen speaking of shame the author links it to what she describes as our culture of scarcity. This is obviously not basic deprivation, but a culture that sends a message that there is never enough–we are never good looking enough, strong enough, successful enough, rich enough, and countless other areas where we don’t measure up. She posits that our culture tells us that an ordinary life is meaningless, that only the extraordinary deserves recognition. Her research shows that there are very set cultural expectations for both females and males. Our culture tells women to be nice, to pursue a thin body ideal, be modest, be domestic, care for children, invest in a romantic relationship, keep sexual intimacy within one relationship, and use their resources to invest in their appearance. Men receive one unrelenting message- do not be perceived as weak. This translates into every endeavor. They are supposed to be winners, to have emotional control, be risk takers, be dominant and self reliant, recognize the primacy of work, exercise power over women and constantly pursue status. When faced with these cultural expectations, if we buy into them, how can we ever measure up?\n\nOne way we try is to pursue what we see as perfection. If we can look perfect and do things correctly we can avoid shame. Yet perfection is unachievable, but its pursuit ends up being addictive, for when we feel shame we believe that it is because we were not prefect enough. The author, who is a well educated over achiever, describes her own life as the pursuit of perfection in order to avoid shame- a quixotic journey at best. As opposed to perfection, she feels that we must have a recognition and appreciation for what is enough. When we believe that who we are is enough–rather than some culturally driven perception of perfection- then we can embrace a feeling of worthiness. We must find such feeling through sharing our vulnerabilities with others, but also by practicing self compassion. Self compassion has three elements: self kindness- being warm and understanding with ourselves when we fail; common humanity-feelings of inadequacy are shared experiences; and mindfulness- taking a balanced approach to negative emotions. By accepting ourselves as “enough”, she doesn’t suggest an abandonment of hard work and great effort to achieve reasonable goals. But she realizes that these efforts are not about winning or losing, they are about both. That is vulnerability, recognizing both and being fully engaged.\n\nShe discusses the harmful effects of shame in the workplace, and characterizes it as the killer of innovation. When new ideas are ridiculed, the proponent is also ridiculed and made to feel less worthy. Such ridicule stifles new ideas and instead encourages employees to “not rock the boat” for fear of reprisal. She posits that when “an organization’s culture mandates that it is more important to protect the reputation of a system and those who power it than it is to protect the basic dignity of individuals or communities, you can be certain that shame is systemic, money drives ethics, and accountability is dead”. When I read that I thought– Doesn’t it describe most large public and private bodies? If ridicule squelches creativity in the workplace, it does so on a much greater scale in our schools, where it is so common and the recipients are particularly vulnerable.\n\nHer discussion of parenting puts all this in an instructive perspective. She begins with a short statement that may best summarize being a parent:\n\n“Who we are and how we engage with the world are much stronger predictors of how our children will do than what we know about parenting. The question isn’t are you parenting the right way, but, Are you the adult that you want your child to grow up to be?”\n\nShe goes much further, and stresses the importance of honesty with children and sharing difficult experiences that a mother or father may have gone through. However, she doesn’t suggest “telling all”. If there are wild escapades in a parent’s past, he or she must be careful in reciting such matters as these stories could validate behavior that you do not wish do encourage. She again stresses not teaching perfectionism–not asking children to seek self validation by valuing what others think. Most of all, she stresses that a child must always know that he or she is valued, is worthy of love and belonging. A child must also know that parents can never be perfect, but that parents and children can practice self compassion and vulnerability. She also again illustrates the difference between shame and guilt with children and notes the real difference between sending the message you are bad, and you did something bad. The first is shame and corrodes the part of us that believes we can do better. If a child tells a lie, she can change that behavior. If she’s a liar, where’s the potential for change in that? Most importantly, a child must know that he or she will always belong at home. The author defines “belonging” in contrast to “fitting in”. “Fitting in” is about assessing a situation and becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are.”\n\nSo rather than living in this culture of scarcity, she suggests “wholehearted living”. Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion and connection to wake up in the morning and think-no matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough. It is going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging. This is the opposite of a life of scarcity.\n\nThe author does make one foray into a sense of spirituality, in a very inclusive way, when she speaks of wholeheartedness and connectivity:\n\n“Spirituality was a fundamental guidepost to wholeheartedness- not religiosity but the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to one another by a force greater than ourselves- a force grounded in love and compassion.”\n\nIsn’t this indeed the common link between peoples?",
    "Last week I was sitting outside a coffee shop reading a book on my kindle when a youngish guy walked by carrying a coffee and a computer, looking for a place to sit.\n\nSince all of the tables were occupied and he was looking a bit displaced, I offered him a seat at my table. Relieved, he sat down and expressed his gratitude. I promptly went back to my reading but I could feel his eyes boring into me as I anticipated the dreaded question.\n\n\"What are you reading?\" he finally blurted.\n\nNow I know this is neither a profound nor earth-shattering inquiry but there were two problems at hand here.\n\nOne, I'm terrible at summarizing books. Just awful. (Which you're about to discover.) There's just something about the vast amount of information that I'm pressured to wrap into one or two sentences that completely overwhelms and paralyzes me.\n\nAnd two, I was reading a book about shame and vulnerability. Which ironically, I was ashamed to admit for fear of being vulnerable. Clearly, I had just started reading the book.\n\nPart of me was tempted to lie to youngish guy by replying, \"oh, it's just some silly novel.\"\n\nBut then it occurred to me how shameful it would be to lie about reading a book about shame and vulnerability instead of just being vulnerable. Besides, as I'm sure it's obvious--I could use the practice.\n\n\"I'm reading Daring Greatly by Brené Brown. It's about shame and vulnerability and how shame can truly only dissipate by allowing yourself to be vulnerable\", I quickly blurted.\n\nAllowing myself to be vulnerable led Patrick and I into a conversation for the next hour. Patrick, if you're reading this, c'était une joie pour vous rencontrer. (If this is wrong I blame Google translate.)\n\nThis moment of unabashed vulnerability with Patrick was the beginning of a major shift in my life. And I have Daring Greatly to thank for that.*\n\nI've always been one to be honest and open but Brene Brown's writing in Daring Greatly takes openness to another level.\n\nShe reinforces what I've known all along but been afraid of admitting--that vulnerability leads to happiness. Or as Brown calls it, \"wholeheartedness\".\n\nAnd I, and maybe you too, could damn well use some wholeheartedness in my life.\n\nWe're living in a culture of `never enough'. I'm certainly feeling it. Are you? I never work hard enough, I don't help others enough, I'm not successful enough, I don't eat healthy enough... and on and on.\n\nThese thoughts of `never enough' turn into feelings of shame and fear. How do we combat shame and fear? By being vulnerable and expressing gratitude, according to Brené Brown. And now, according to me.\n\nFollowing Brene's advice and expertise garnered through her research and life stories, truly does work.\n\nIt was the reading of Daring Greatly that prompted me to finally divulge my long kept secret of my history with an eating disorder; which wound up being my highest trafficked blog post of all time. As Brown explains, we're drawn to other's vulnerability but repelled by our own.\n\nAre you living with shame? Do you always feel an underlying itch of `never enough'? Do you find yourself disconnecting from people you love? If any of these questions ring true then I hope you'll read this book for yourself. Even if they don't ring true, read this book. It truly is a game changer.\n\nBuy It Right. This. Minute. Sit your butt down for an hour, and start reading. I promise you won't want to stop. I promise.Then come back to me and practice your newfound vulnerability. I'll appreciate and love every drop of the real you. And eventually, you will too. That's the truth.\n\n[...]\n*If you'll note the vulnerability here in that I'm attempting to review a book, despite my fear of reviewing books.",

For everyone who wants to love, be in a relationship, and have meaningful connection whether that's with family, work colleagues, friends or a partner - and finds that a little bit difficult.",
    "It’s taking me a ridiculous amount of time to read as I’m going back over stuff, highlighting, writing questions to myself in the margin, reading bits out to friends and clients! For goodness sake I may not finish it til Xmas at this rate. Lots of good, thought provoking ideas and ideals. I’m loving it.",
    "Good classic Brené Brown. I am studying counselling at the moment, so I am reading lots of this kind of material. She is really a master, who takes something as complex and sometimes difficult to navigate as human emotion, and presents it in a form that it gives one the courage to dip deeper into the world of self discovery, great stuff!",
    "I had high expectations of the book because of all the hype I'd heard and it far exceeded my expectations. Absolutely amazing, thought provoking, informative, wise, funny, true and so much more. It was literally one of the best books I've read in a long time and I don't know that I've ever highlighted so much in a book before?!"

    "This book, by Psychologist Angela Duckworth, was very illuminating. I had heard of this book before thanks to having read Carol Dwreck and Heidi Grant Halvorson's books, but I wish I had read this one before them because I feel that it provides the foundational basis for those other two authors delve into with mindsets. Halvorson and Duckworth's books together seem to give a more concise and efficient view on how to pursue goals. Dwreck details the self-conceptions and lists anecdotal examples.\n\nThe most striking matter I've found about this book doesn't really relate to the book per se. I've discovered that a lot of the more \"official\" reviews, such as the New Yorker, are being utterly pretentious and vilifying this book based on arguments that Angela Duckworth never made or even implied. I was shocked to see the radical difference between the contents of the book and the disparaging reviews that were being dishonest in their representation of both her research and her as a person. I was in disbelief until I read her perspective on her TEDTalk in her own book where she mentions, in much nicer words than I'm describing, how the CEO of TED basically asked her to dumb down her information to the public about her findings. The TEDTalk and the arguments against her feel and sound like they're calling her bluff about nonsense the public has heard before, specifically because she was requested to tone down the information. So, it's unfair. It's unfair of us to judge her based on her TEDTalk and those shockingly disingenuous reviews. I wouldn't honestly be saying this had I not done the same prior to reading her book on a whim.\n\nLong story short: this book isn't about education policy and never claimed to be. This book is for individuals and parents who want to learn what encourages people to find a passion, how to learn to work at that passion for a long term, and how we internalize a greater purpose for ourselves and others by following through with commitments that we feel strongly about. Grit was never about making kids better with grades. Nevertheless, this can only apply to grades, if kids care about the classes they take, but this book is more oriented towards extracurricular activities and encouraging them in kids early, it was never about trying to force kids to be passionate or persevere in grades on subjects they don't care about. Duckworth even explains the problems trying to force people to be passionate about subject matter that they don't care about.\n\nIn Duckworth's book, her interviews and general research have found that people who are very successful in their careers didn't simply find their passion from one incident. They discovered tidbits or gained encouragement from loved ones multiple time. As Duckworth puts it: Again, and again, and again. People might be happy to know that there isn't a specific parenting style, you just shouldn't devalue or tell your child the interest is bad, if you want to encourage their growth. Moreover, even if a child follows with an activity the parent has misgivings about like joining a music band, evidence shows that sticking to it for more than a year (generally 2 years) is likely to encourage them to stick to future goals when they discover a new passion. In the long term, the \"grit\" mindset of following through with your intrinsic passion can have long-term benefits. Also, much of the passion and perseverance doesn't come from pushing through adversity, but rather being encouraged to follow your intrinsic motivation. Children need encouraging parents and teachers, we need encouraging friends, and - most of all - we need a sense that what we're doing is meaningful for both ourselves and a greater society. I began realizing that a lot of the passion in the passion and perseverance rubric could apply to the immediate feedback loop that video games give people. Generally, we can immediately ascertain gains and losses and the techniques for how to improve are either instructed in the game itself or can be found from tips online. Having a community of friends to talk to about games like Dragon Quest or Dragon Age is self-reinforcing.\n\nI'm somewhat hesitant to jot down a list of the crucial parts of her research, because I'm often afraid that I'm simply not giving this book and it's author due credit by paraphrasing and potentially taking her out of context. I'm particularly hesitant because of how thoroughly people have insulted caricatures of her work instead of the work itself. When people begin counting terminology and the number of times a word was used, I begin to question whether they had ever even read her book at all. I was really disappointed with so many reviews that conflate Carol Dwreck and Angela Duckworth's research with their personality characteristics. This isn't even isolated to women or even people who exist in the present-day. I just keep spotting this same pattern and when I read someone's work, it's largely incredibly different from what accusers espouse that their work contains. I don't want to contribute to that form of misinformation, even if subconsciously, and I don't like taking someone's words out of context as I see so often done.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed her book thoroughly, but I couldn't personally identify with the parenting chapter and the chapter after it seemed like it was simply filling space with anecdotes. Angela Duckworth seems to write in a journalistic fashion just like Carol Dwreck, they both utilize anecdotes to give people a more impressionable affect and it probably helps the average reader to remember more. I prefer Heidi Grant Halvorson's more personalized writing style where she presents the reader with questionable assumptions about life and then presents the evidence to explain the reasoning behind why the research is valuable and how it can improve lives.",
    "For decades the U.S. Army has been educating their finest at West Point military academy. Only about half of the 2,500 applicants meet its rigorous academic and physical standards, which are as high as the elite universities. Nearly all men and women are ‘varsity athletes’. The first few months, known as the Beast, are the most physically and emotionally demanding of the four-year course. All admitted candidates have been selected, based on the ‘Whole Candidate Score’ test.\n\nHowever, those who stayed and those who dropped out during the Beast, had indistinguishable scores. Both the Army and Dr. Duckworth were perplexed by the question: “Who spends two years trying to get into a place and then drops out in the first two months?”\n\nWhat emerged from Duckworth’s work on the problem was the Grit Scale—a test that measures the extent to which you approach life with grit. Grit turned out to be an astoundingly reliable predictor of who made it through and who did not.\n\nThe Grit Scale was tested with sales people, among others, who are subject to the daily hardship of rejection. In an experiment involving hundreds of men and women who sold vacation time-share, Grit predicted who stayed and who left. Similar results were found in other demanding professions such as education.\n\n“I came to a fundamental insight that would guide my future work,” explains Duckworth. “Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.”\n\nNatural talent as the explanation of success, according to sociologist, Professor Dan Chambliss, “is perhaps the most pervasive lay explanation we have for athletic success.” However, his research led him to the conclusion that the minimal talent needed to succeed, is lower than most of us think.\n\n“Without effort, your talent is nothing more than your unmet potential. Without effort, your skill is nothing more than what you could have done but didn’t. With effort, talent becomes skill, and effort makes skill productive.”\n\nGrammy Award–winning musician and Oscar-nominated actor, Will Smith, says of himself: “I’ve never really viewed myself as particularly talented. Where I excel is a ridiculous, sickening work ethic.”\n\nToo many of us, it appears, give up far too early and far too often.\n\nDuckworth’s research has led her to the conclusion that Grit has four components: interest, practice, passion, and hope.\nAccording to the meta-analysis of sixty studies conducted over the past sixty years, employees whose personal interests fit with their occupations, do their jobs better, are more helpful to their co-workers, and stay at their jobs longer.\n\nOf course, just because you love something doesn’t mean you will excel at it. Many people are poor at the things they love. Many of the Grit paragons interviewed by Duckworth spent years exploring several different interests before discovering the one that eventually came to occupy all of their waking thoughts. “While we might envy those who love what they do for a living, we shouldn’t assume that they started from a different place than the rest of us. Chances are, they took quite some time figuring out exactly what they wanted to do with their lives,” she explains.\n\nThe second requirement of Grit is practice. Numerous interviews of Grit paragons revealed that they are all committed to continuous improvement. There are no exceptions. This continuous improvement leads to a gradual improvement of their skills over years.\n\n“That there’s a learning curve for skill development isn’t surprising. But the timescale on which that development happens is,” Duckworth discovered. Anders Ericsson’s work with a German music academy revealed that those who excelled, practised about 10,000 hours over ten years before achieving elite levels of expertise. The less accomplished practised half as much.\n\nEricsson’s crucial insight is not that experts practice much more, but that they practice very deliberately. Experts are more interested in correcting what they do wrong rather than what they did right, until conscious incompetence becomes unconscious competence.\n\nDancer Martha Graham says “Dancing appears glamorous, easy, delightful. But the path to the paradise of that achievement is not easier than any other. There is fatigue so great that the body cries even in its sleep. There are times of complete frustration. There are daily small deaths.”\n\nGritty people do more deliberate practice than others.\n\nThe third component of Grit is purpose, the desire to contribute to the well-being of others. If Grit starts with a relatively self-oriented interest to which self-disciplined practice is added, the end point is integrating that work with an other-centred purpose.\n\n“The long days and evenings of toil, the setbacks and disappointments and struggle, the sacrifice—all this is worth it because, ultimately, their efforts pay dividends to other people,” Duckworth identified. Most Gritty people saw their ultimate aims as deeply connected to the world beyond themselves.\n\nThe bricklayer may have a job laying bricks so he can pay for food. He may later see bricklaying as his career, and later still as a calling to build beautiful homes for people. It is this last group who seem most satisfied with their jobs and their lives overall, and missed at least a third fewer days of work than those with merely a job or a career as opposed to a calling.\n\nThe final component of Grit is hope, but a different kind to the “hopium” many embrace. It is the expectation that our own efforts can improve our future. The hope that creates Grit has nothing to do with luck, so failure is a cue to try harder, rather than as confirmation that one lacks ability.\n\nThe book also includes chapters on developing Gritty children, sports teams, and companies.\n\nIt is a book for those who relish solid research and well-reasoned conclusions. It is highly motivational, in a mature and thoughtful way. Get the book. Work it, and share the knowledge. It could be transformative.\n\nReadability Light ---+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High -+--- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of Strategy that Works.",
    "\"Grit\" was suggested to me for reading. My greatest takeaway from the book:\n1.If you think of the overall well-being of people around you, you tend to be more successful in the long run\n2.Deliberate practice makes you better at a skill\n3.While learning something different, the first stage of introduction needs to be interesting and playful, strenuous efforts are required at a later stage\n\nFor finding these takeaways, you need to pass through the vast jungle of psychology study and data. On certain occasions it feels like research has been done for certain evident things also. This makes it boring on certain occasions.\n\nHowever, it is an intelligent book challenging conventional wisdom and places the required prerogative on the importance of efforts above everything else.",
    "The book makes good points about grit vs. talent and explain what fosters grit. However there is not enough about how you achieve all that. There is little practical advice I can apply to my life right now. Also, the book focuses on success and grit, not looking at failure and grit. How gritty were those who failed? Did they fail because they stuck with something that did not work? The evidence that grit is associated with success does not explode grit is also related to failure.",
    "I read this on holiday and found it a real page turner. Written in an easy to read style and full of real people and real stories about success as it pertains to grittiness! It certainly hits the nail on the head in promoting positive mental attitude plus major work ethic over simply giftedness or talent. It promotes success through very targeted steps in improvement and not just trying harder in general. The book explores success in the business, sporting, academic and other walks of life, so interesting to all readers. The science is current and up to date. It is inspiring and full of practical tips amongst the theory of success being proposed and evidenced from the studies conducted. If you enjoy reading about human development this is for you. Teachers will definitely find this essential reading. Business people, sports people, or literally anyone wanting to get on in life will find this book hugely engaging. I will be reading it again for sure.",
    "Great book, plenty of examples. Good narrative and it's easy to understand the impact of the suggestions. I can think of many people that need to read this now and I could have benefited from reading it 20 years ago.",
    "If you've ever doubted yourself or decided that there's no point trying as you lack the talent for it - read this. Inspiring and insightful read, well written and engaging. Very hard to put down once you pick it up!"

    "Before reading this book I was not running nor have I ever bow hunted. For 3 years leading into this year I've been talking about getting into bow hunting but haven't yet. I also haven't laced up a pair of running shoes in 12+ years and back when I stopped I told myself I would never run distances again. I don't think this book should be thought of as an inspiration to bow hunt, run, or lift. I think it more accurately inspires one to do more, better themselves, and work to find or invest in your passions. To become obsessed.\n\nI've read the book and listened to the audio book. In effort to not be a total fanboy, I don't think Cam is the best story teller but he does a pretty damn good job for a bowhunter. I love his mantra of not giving advice, he more simply says what he does. I can respect and appreciate that approach. So while Cam doesn't give advice I think we need to analyze his actions and results to understand that both his successes in bowhunting and even ultra running really do speak for themselves. Cam's found a way to work harder and now lives a life surrounded by greats for other fields which he continues to instill their mindsets into honing his own craft. From Cam's early decision in life when he found bow hunting that lead a life inspired to stop drinking and dedicate himself to his craft, to being obsessed, not listening to his haters or the \"must be nice\" crowd, and so on, this book leads by example for chasing your passions and dreams.\n\nI will say that ironically (or maybe not so ironically...) I'm running again and loving it. My first 3 weeks back admittedly sucked bad and hurt. Since starting running again 50 days ago, I've only missed 3 runs. After the hardship and pain in the first 3 weeks I now look forward to daily runs despite how sore, busy, or even unmotivated I am because I know that during and after that sense of accomplishment and mind clearing is worth it. As a father of a very active 2.5 year old, getting back into running is for me and him. I need to be able to keep up, have a strong heart and have the energy to help him chase his dreams. I feel that running will help me do that. I'm also going into my local bow shop soon to chase a long time goal of bow hunting. My wife and I renovated her grandparents farm home that sits on 110 acres, so I'm excited to be more self-sufficient. I know that her grandpa would have a big smile on his face knowing that I'm hunting the land that he had hunted for over 60 years now.\n\nSo, I definitely want to thank Cam for lighting a fire under me to be better, start checking goals off of my list and find my passion to be obsessed over. Keep Hammering!",
    "So first off I'm pretty sure Cam didn't intend for this to specifically be a self help/ Success book, that being said, the way it is written really brings awareness to one's own lack of effort. I have read several hundred self help books and this one I would put in the top 2 tied with Think and Grow Rich.\n\nCam is a regular guy who has shown the world what happens when a person pushes themselves consistently year after year. It's no overnight Success, even though that's what the world sees. This is simply what happens with decades of relentless Endurement and a goal which is something that our society has mostly lost.\n\nI've never met Cam, I grew up reading his articles and bought his first book on blacktail hunting. Hopefully he produces books on Roosevelt Elk hunting and Big game recipes. We have the same barber, live a few miles apart, hunt several of the same areas, and have mutual friends but never met. I've only seen him 1 time, he was running through town, due to the time/location I'd assume he was running on his lunch break. It's great to see this level of resolve and action getting recognized, too bad it's not the norm for people",
    "There are few men in life that actually DO what they SAY and Cam is one of them. The authenticity of this book is what I love most and it happens to be what I admire most about Cam as a person. This book was inspiring, helpful practical, and challenging in so many ways. I bought the hard copy AND the audio book because there’s so much to glean from both reading and listening. Since finishing the book, I’ve gotten off the couch and now run 3-5 miles every day. I feel alive and grateful. Thank you, Cam for sharing your journey and hard work. Keep Hammering brother!",
    "Cameron Hanes is a man. He hunts. He doesn’t have an excuse not do whatever is required to get the job done. The book was a very easy read and got to know a glimpse of his life and what he’s gone through. I specifically appreciate him sharing his deep love for his late friend Roy. Brotherhood like that doesn’t come often. Highly recommend reading it just to continue to push yourself and keep going. This is a little about hunting but if you really read what he is trying convey behind the hunting stories you apply it to real life. Great book!",
    "Cam doesn’t fill his book with 10 steps to become successful or quotes he thinks will motivate you for all of 10 seconds. He also doesn’t tell you how to live your life. He simply shares his mindset and experiences and it’s impossible not to be inspired by his incredible perseverance and commitment to be the best he can. He simply works hard every single day and lives every day believing he’s lucky to alive. This book is amazing and even if you have no interest in bow hunting or fitness or lifting weights, this is still going to push you to make more of your own life. Couldn’t recommend it highly enough.",
    "This book provided me with so much insight and enlightenment to my capabilities. I realized my old way of doing 'my best' was a mere scratch of the surface. I've already elevated in the days reading this book and I'm excited to elevate and Keep Hamering",
    "Great read. So inspiring",
    "What a man! Makes you look at yourself and think about what you’re actually giving. Work harder, nobody cares! Keep Hammering",
    "It would be nearly impossible to read this book and not feel the the deepest motivation to set and reach new goals. The beauty of the book and Cams story is that through his story you can put yourself in his shoes and realize that everyone has the potential with enough effort to succeed wherever you aim. Hard to put down book, hopefully they’ll be another book from Cameron Hanes soon"

    "I rarely read anything even remotely reminiscent of autobiographical, preffering to indulge in primarily fictitious work. However some peoples stories are just to interesting to say no to. Tim is one of those people. While most autobiographies are self felatiating, this one is rife with self deprecation, through which Tim describes the innumerous short comings of his life brought about by hubris and short sightedness that surmounted into one large resounding success beyond which most would be nearly able to claim. This work shows that only those that fear to try will truly fail. It reads much like he speaks, so if you indulge in every podcast he attends or observe any of his various instructional videos with enjoyment, you won't be left disappointed. From the moment you crack the cover, you've been hooked. And this book will drag you through the tumultuous murky water until you inevitably break the surface into the resounding surprise and grand breadth of daylight. It's simply a book about one mans life, but what a life it is.",
    "I could not put this book down-I did not want it to end! it is one of the most honest, raw, educational books I've ever read. If you do not know Tim Kennedy- he will give you alot to think about! If you follow Tim Kennedy, it's been an amazing journey reading the personal details and the chapter dedicated to Afghanistan- this is one of the most remarkable books if our time & it was a joy to pre- order this book & get it as Tim went on his press tour. A man who lives his country- family-God-dies as much good as he is able & has no idea what a gero he is😊",
    "Tim was one of the first guest on my podcast & I was immediately blown away by his Drive & Tenacity. To this day, I was always confused by why someone so popular & well known agreed to help someone like me that was so fresh & unknown. After reading this book & getting an uncensored welcome into Tim’s life, it’s all began to make sense. From his childhood experiences to the experiences he has overcome as an adult, I finally was able to understand his passion for helping people despite their appearance, beliefs or social status. I was always a bit inspired by Tim but after reading Scars & Stripes, I’m not only more inspired but I’m motivated to want to leave a greater impact on the community and set expectations for myself to be a better man. I would highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to read something fresh & real which is lacking in society now a days. It’s a game changer for sure & leaves no question or doubt on why Tim has accomplished the feats that’s he has.",
    "Bought this book after I had been following Tim through social media for a few years and him hyping the book up through podcast he guest starred on. Let me tell you, This book is the real deal look into Tim’s life and experiences. I bought the book to read while out in the field with the Army and forgot to pack it after I had read a couple chapters so I bought the audible read by Tim himself and it brings the whole book to life. You can hear it first hand from the man that wrote it and few it in his voice. What an amazing and beautifully written book Tim!",
    "I don’t read so good. This book had me trapped, staying up late to get to the next chapter. I was enthralled with every word. Tim crushed it. He has lived one hell of a life, and captured it perfectly in this book. Tim, if you see this: thank you for your service, and thank you for the inspiration to live life to the fullest and do my best to be as bad ass as I can be. Tim is an American hero, and I can only hope to be half the man he is.",
    "I needed to read this journey at this time in my life and am very thankful for being able to do so. I am left inspired and invigorated to continue to better myself while also helping those in need. Thank you.",
    "Tim is that guy you love to hate. You hate him because he will never accept you for you. Not because he’s a bad guy or because he wishes you harm but because he knows that you’re capable of so much more and he’ll never stop pushing you to be that person he knows you can be. That also just happens to be the reason why you love him, for his very faith and passion for people. We need more Americans like Tim.",
    "Always loved Tim Kennedy and getting to know his story was incredible. He is truly the real Captain America and this book proved it. Just hope I get to meet this man one day.",
    "I bought this in hope of some great, self-aware historical accounts of Kennedy’s life through his own eyes. Sadly it’s so full of bravado, false-machoness (especially when he was a child) and overly exaggerated stories of his own greatness that it is a painful read.",
    "I didn't really know what to expect from this book to be honest. What I got was a small incite into the mind of Tim Kennedy, a great book. It is full of stories that just make you think & go \"Damn, how the hell is he going to survive this one!\" Worth the read, truly inspiring.",
    "What can I say, lived 3 lives, just a humble, brilliant human who we should be thankful exists. Thanks for his service because without people like him the world is definitely a worse place.",
    "Phenomenally written and really hard to put down",
    "Great autobiography of a true hero."

    "Favorite author. Will buy all his books.\nBook was brand new",
    "I read this book a couple of years ago as part of a principal leadership training. I dusted it off again to revisit some ideas. I found it more valuable now as a principal leading staff in post-pandemic recovery. We will use this as our leadership book study this year. Yes, it is that good with easy things to do and implement.",
    "Once I finished \"Leaders Eat Last\", I noticed that most of the highlighting I had done in the book was in the first 1/4-1/2. That's not to say that the book wasn't well rounded, but I took more away from the front half than I did the back half. Throughout the book, you'll read about a number of studies/stories that Sinek uses to drive home several of his points. To me, this way of teaching really helps to solidify the lessons being taught.\n\nI started this book thinking it would be heavily focused on business and how to be a better manager. Once I completed the book, I was surprised to find that the intent was about being a better person, not simply a better leader. There are a number of key points in the book where I had to stop for a moment and look to my past organizations and day dream about how Sinek's lessons seemed to ring true in my own working life. \"Leaders Eat Last\" helped to open my mind to show what organizations (and leaders) in my past did well, did poorly, and how it changed the culture within the given organization.\n\n\"Leaders Eat Last\" is a great read for anyone looking to improve on their leadership qualities, and in return, improve their organizations. There are several videos online featuring Sinek. These videos incorporate a number of the same stories and studies mentioned in \"Leaders Eat Last\" (some word for word). Watching these videos after I completed the book helped me to understand many of the points that Sinek was making.\n\n\"Leaders Eat Last\" is a much easier read than a number of management style books on the market. The featured stories are exciting, the studies mentioned are relevant (and different than what other books mention), and Sinek's style of writing kept me engaged. I do wish the ending of the book was as strong as the beginning, but I believe \"Leaders Eat Last\" should be on the shelf of anyone looking to rank up in their given profession.\n\nIf you ever have looked at a book after I got done reading it, you'd notice I am \"one of those readers\". The books are filled with random highlights and Post-It bookmarks, that point to things I found interesting or that I wanted to remember. Here are some of my favorite highlights from \"Leaders Eat Last\"-some spoilers possible. These highlights are just some of my takeaways. Just because I highlighted a thought, does not mean I share this same belief or that I am in agreement:\n\n\"I know of no study in history that describes an organization that has been managed out of a crisis. Every single one of them was led\"\n\n\"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader\"\n\n\"As employees or members of the group, we need the courage to take care of each other when our leaders don't. And in doing so, we become the leaders we wish we had\"\n\nSinek points to the nomadic Mongolian families as an example showcasing that certain groups who, \"may not have much\", share what little they do have with others because it's in their best interest (and survival) to do so.\n\nI found Chapter 13 \"Abstraction Kills\" to be the best chapter in the book. In this chapter, Sinek goes into detail about how the trial of horrible experiment(s) in Nazi Germany, resulted in individuals pleading innocence because they were simply following orders. Sinek couples this story with the Milgram Experiment. In this study, we see that people will push the limits simply to obey orders. I found Chapter 13 to be relevant to a number of fields still today. We often watch the news and find someone did something (or lack of action) simply because a higher power advised them to do so. The lack of connection between the two parties often resulted in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nIn Chapter 15 \"Managing the Abstraction\" Sinek does a terrific shop in showing that numbers aren't always the best way to tell a story. Sinek describes the optics of the brutality of a government on its own people (a large number) vs a detailed story about the death of a young female (one person, but with detail). Both are horrible and sad situations, but in most cases a connection is stronger with a small number and a story, then a number that is almost too big for us to comprehend. \"At some point the numbers lose their connection to the people and become just numbers, void of meaning.\n\nSinek details a story about Captain Marquet who was set to take command of the most efficient crew in the US Navy. Captain Marquet was moved to take command of the lowest ranking crew (but with one of the newest subs). Through a series of events Captain Marquet had to change his management style and admit that it was not about his command, rather it was the crews ability to work together that resulted in a complete turnaround.\n\nLastly, one of my favorite highlights of \"Leaders Eat Last\", was Sinek's take on the idea of participation trophies and rewards. \"Rewards for basic participation have other adverse effects as well. They not only deny children the chance to learn important lessons about adversity, loss, and resilience, but they can also encourage complacency and overconfidence.",
    "I am enjoying the book. It has some interesting concepts on what makes a leader. I’m not finished reading it but so far so good.",
    "I read this book as an assignment for one of my doctoral classes. Having never read Sinek’s work before, I was hoping to glean some leadership tips. Overall, this book gives some good, solid tips for creating successful work environments, changing the toxic idea of placing profits before people, and working with millennials. Although I enjoyed this book and took away many leadership ideas, I would have rated it higher if it hadn’t contained flawed information about human biology and millennials.\nTaking the title from a Marine Corps tradition where officers eat after the junior enlisted men, Simon Sinek uses this leadership practice to exemplify successful, safe and trustworthy environments.\nHe claims there is a need to feel safe held by employees and that it is the job of leaders to create a protective environment, which he calls a Circle of Safety. To create this circle, Sinek shares his idea that human physical chemicals play a part in this process. He develops the idea that toxic environments are led by toxic chemicals which are unchecked by leaders. To create an environment of safety and trust, Sinek shows how to work with the “selfless” chemicals to create balance.\nAs a former biology instructor, I felt this “research” behind these chemicals was flimsy at best. He claims that evolution has conditioned all humans to be led solely by their chemicals without any restraint by reasonable thought or self-will. He extends this to the realm of work environments, by naming those toxic environments as those led by the bad chemicals. He claims successful environments use the “selfless” chemicals to create environments where everyone is in the Circle of Safety.\nContradicting himself, he claims at one point that everyone has these chemicals and that these primeval urges cannot be stopped. Then, he advocates for environments led by them to change their chemical makeup. If we can’t help it, how are we ever going to be able to change it?\nDespite this major flaw, using relatable stories from military and corporate leadership, Sinek provides great examples of failed and successful environments. He also gives steps to help create profitable and healthy environments.\nIn an interesting section, Sinek points out the addiction of technology tools and social media and how it affects the workplace. He provides leaders with helpful and practical tips to manage these addictions in order to keep a safe, trusting environment within a work setting.\nThis edition of the book contains an expanded guide to leading millennials in the workplace. His research reveals the tendencies of the group as a whole and how a leader can use those to develop them into workers of integrity, trust, and innovation that benefits everyone.\nThis section was extremely helpful, but it has received criticism about its overgeneralization of millennial behavior. As someone who works with children and millenials, I found this criticism to be true. Many of the characteristics he mentioned -- especially impatience, inability to deal with failure, and task perseverance -- are seen in younger children rather than millennials. This can be attributed to the influence of technology from a young age, which was not experienced by most millennials since the boom of PCs and mobile phones occurred in the mid-90s.\nAlso, he unleashes on the “Me” generation, parents of millennials, as the source of the troubles. He makes unfounded assumptions about the background and upbringing of the entire generation, of which he is a part, but never acknowledges as so.\nThis book gives great advice about creating organizational environments that are healthy and successful. It is filled with real stories of organizations and people who have made a difference in the lives of workers. Although not providing any earth-shattering ideas, it gives solid advice for leaders about creating great environments for their followers.",
    "Simon not only talks about the right leadership but how important is to build relationships! Inspiring and emotional. Recommended to everyone!",
    "Good",
    "This book says nothing more than \"treat employees well\" - it's totally obvious. As another reader has commented, he has hand-selected anecdotes which he retro-fits to fit his ideas. Another reader says that the book is grounded in evidence. It is not. It uses flimsy, hand-picked evidence which readers lap up because they'd like it to be true (\"nice\" companies do well and \"nasty\" companies do badly in the long run). There are lots of examples of companies that failed because they focused excessively on being nice rather than being efficient (see O'Toole's \"The Enlightened Capitalists\"). He plays to every stereotype and has the standard one-sided populist rants against business, banks, shareholders. He then branches off into the dangers of multitasking and social media which has nothing to do with leadership - this book is everything he wants to say about the world.\n\nThis is classic Simon Sinek. He has no expertise - he's neither a top executive, nor a top business journalist, nor a top business researcher, but just makes stuff up and makes it sound good like the advertising executive that he is. He did this with Start With Why (but now claims Apple is an evil company that pays insufficient tax, even though he praised it in SWW) and repeats the formula here. Some of his arguments are completely ludicrous. He claims Wells Fargo is an ethical, motivating company founded on a Why rather than targets. This has been shown to be patently false as targets are what caused Wells Fargo to open fake bank accounts. Moreover, his argument for how Wells Fargo motivated employees was that a customer would come in and tell them a story of how their loan changed their life by allowing them to pay off a debt. He claims that Wells Fargo serves some higher purpose by doing this - when all it is is giving a customer debt to pay off debt, so the customer is just as indebted as before.",
    "A book of baseless assertions 'supported' by anecdotes spun to suit them, founded on the idea that military leadership is applicable to real-world organisations. (It isn't.) Business journalism at its most eye-catching and most awful.",
    "Leaders Eat Last is a worthwhile read. I would give it 3/5 stars with the following comments:\n\nSinek offers a brief explanation of how psychology and biochemistry guide our choices and behaviours. He then develops this by proposing his ‘Circle of Safety’ theory of human behaviour, and relates this to working environments. I found this part of the book the most compelling. Although not intended to be an academic text, he grounds his theory in scientific evidence, expressed in uncomplicated straightforward language. He also provides real-world examples to develop your understanding and to place his explanations firmly within a work or business context.\n\nFurther into the book historical context is given to support the observation that workplace cultures change along with the psychologies of those that inhabit them- I found this worthy of reflection, although it was a little long and tedious in places. Whilst not an instruction manual for creating workplace trust, nor a presentation of ‘The Business Case for Workplace Altruism’ it is possible to glean ‘dos and don’ts’ from the many case studies given.\n\nWhilst undeniably hopeful, there are several areas for improvement. The book lost 2 stars because the examples became repetitive after the first few chapters; I found them excessive and unnecessary. They didn’t add anything to the argument being made. The structure and pace of the book also left much to be desired. I kept reading hoping that the last two-thirds of the book would show a development of the author’s ideas, but they merely re-stated the first third with another gush of case studies.\n\nI think the ideas in this text would have been expressed in a more interesting way if they had been presented as a series of three or four essays. This might have curbed Sinek's habit of repetition and overuse of illustrative examples, making his arguments clear and more persuasive. He might have paced himself more effectively and linked his ideas better (for example his explanation of the Baby Boomer and Millenial work ethics).",
    "Not as good as “Start with Why” and “The Infinite Game” but worth a read. In the book Simon describes a number of the drugs that the body makes when it does certain things. As always Simon has some great examples and case studies. The reader must understand that Simon backs his arguments with a sample of one and we should never use a sample of one. Just because one company is “bad” it does not make all companies \"bad\". Must admit, I found that last 100 pages tiresome as Simon as these are all based around Simon’s opinion.",
    "This book is truly amazing. I can't imagine the amount of time that went into doing all the research behind this book.\nThe anecdotes are so good, you just keep reading/listening, based on whether you're using audible or not.\nSinek is a great story teller and this book is an example of how to explain what most people might consider relatively difficult topics in a very interesting way.\nThe psychology and the play of hormones behind our behaviours was probably the most valuable part for me. I had never thought of it that way prior to reading the book. And suddenly a lot of things that I kept wondering about started making sense.\nI wish I had read this book before I took the leap to a leadership role. But maybe I wouldn't have been able to relate it as much if I hadn't given leadership a shot and made my own mistakes earlier.\nI loved it once and I am sure I will read it many times throughout my career to remind me how to keep being an amazing leader."

    "Lots of excellent strategies that can be adapted for all age groups.",
    "This book is an amazing resource for teachers wanting to improve their implementation of reading strategies. There are many, many strategies included, with specific steps and instructions as to how to use them in your classroom. As you identify the goals for your student, you can determine what strategy would be appropriate, and look at samples of how to implement the intervention.\nChapters in the book are organized by goals for developing skilled readers, with an explanation (with research) as to why each goal is important. There are also suggestions on how to assess, so the strategy matches the goal the student should be working towards. The strategies also cover a wide range of readers, from pre-emergent to level Z.\nOne of my favorite parts of the book is the inclusion of why the goals are important; Jennifer Serravallo includes solid research-based explanations in regards to “why,” and this background knowledge can give teachers a better understanding of how to develop skilled readers.\nIn addition to classroom teachers, reading teachers/specialists and literacy coaches would also find this book a handy addition to their libraries, as the strategies can be utilized across grade levels. The book would be a helpful resource to share during coaching sessions, as it is very teacher-friendly and easy to use. I have gone back to this book again and again; for veterans or new teachers, it is an invaluable tool!",
    "\"Effective reading strategies are like my favorite recipes; they teach you how to accomplish something that is not yet automatic in a broken down, step-by-step manner.\" - Jennifer Serravallo, The Reading Strategies Book: Your EVERYTHING Guide to Developing Skilled Readers\n\nJennifer Serravallo created the ultimate book of reading strategies. This resource is a must have have for schools! Let me explain in terms of who can benefit:\n\n- Campus Leadership: Assistant principals usually coordinate the RtI process and instructional intervention plans. This books will help identify and create individual goals for learners, determine the appropriate strategy and give you ideas for intervention lessons. Best of all, these can be implemented IN the classroom setting by the teacher.In my experience as an assistant principal, I often got responses like, \"He can't read. She struggles with reading. He doesn't try to sound out words. She is not on grade level in reading. He has so may gaps, I don't know where to start.\" This book will help teachers:\nidentify specific instructional goals\nidentify guidelines for readers to practice and apply strategies\ngive helpful feedback to move the reader forward\n- Literacy Specialist/Instructional Coach: This resource can help with coaching conversations with individual teachers or grade level teams.\n- Classroom Teacher: This is truly a comprehensive book to help you develop individual reading goals or goals for reading strategy groups. This a a GREAT resource for reading strategy groups. The lessons in this book can fit into any balanced literacy program.\n\nThe book is organized around the following goals (chapters) for developing skilled readers:\n- Supporting Pre-Emergent and Emergent Readers\n- Teaching Reading Engagement: Focus, Stamina, and Building a Reading Life\n- Supporting Print Work: Increasing Accuracy and Integrating Sources of Information\n- Teaching Fluency: Reading with Paraphrasing, Intonation, and Automaticity\n- Supporting Comprehension in Fiction: Understanding Plot and Setting\n- Supporting Comprehension in Fiction: Thinking About Characters\n- Supporting Comprehension in Fiction: Understanding Themes and Ideas\n- Supporting Comprehension in Nonfiction: Determining Maint Topic(s) and Idea(s)\n- Supporting Comprehension in Nonfiction: Determining Key Details\n- Supporting Comprehension in Nonfiction: Getting the Most from Text Features\n- Improving Comprehension in Fiction and Nonfiction: Understanding Vocabulary and Figurative Language\n- Supporting Students' Conversations: Speaking, Listening, and Deepening Comprehension\n- Improving Writing About Reading\n\nEach chapter starts with a research-based explanation of WHY the goal is important to developing skilled readers. Serravallo also gives you suggestions on how to assess students, because it crucial that the strategy matches the child's goal and the texts they are reading. Strategy lessons include the following (depending on the lesson):\n- Level\n- Genre/Text Type\n- Skill\n- Strategy\n- Prompts\n- Teaching Tips\n- Language Lesson\n- Visuals\n\nSee my full review (with visuals) here: http://loriesqualls.com/2015/07/11/the-reading-strategies-book/\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",
    "I haven't been so excited about professional literature about reading since Mosaic of Thought. IMHO, every grade 2-8 reading teacher (including many MS content teachers) should have this book.\n\nI love the way Serravallo thinks about reading in a practical way. She makes it clear that we need goals for our readers. She realizes the importance of fluency yet debunks all the timed crap going on in some schools. She often cites the work of my reading guru, Ellin Keene. She understands the difference between a strategy and a skill. She recognizes the importance of comprehension strategies.\n\nBest of all, the book is essentially many many 1-page lessons. They are practical and easy to follow. For me, some will be whole group lessons, some small group, and some individual. Some I'll skip, some I'll tweak, and some will definitely improve my Reader's Workshop. You may find that you're already doing many of these lessons but she'll make you rethink the way you talk with kids. I love Serravallo's advice to prompt with few words, to put your finger on the page to connect with the book, to model/clarify what even the most simple strategy looks like (ie, what does it mean to 'go back and reread?'). One lesson in the historical fiction section has me thinking about how to completely revamp my approach to teaching one book in my Language Workshop.\n\nNext year will be my last. When I recommended this book to colleagues and offered a book club, some queried \"Why are you putting in all this effort when you're retiring in June?\" I respond, because this book offers me a chance to improve my teaching of reading. Thank you, Jennifer Serravallo.",
    "Although the examples are American , UK teachers will find a wealth of well-organised strategies to boost pupils' comprehension skills.",
    "One of the only teaching books that is really useful as a platform to inspire your teaching and to have a stock of useful ideas that have been tried and tested. Huge book! Wish it was on kindle too.",
    "This is a great book. I teach grade 1 and there are tons of strategies in here. On each page is a different strategy with possible prompts for different levels of support, visual examples of anchor charts, and reading levels this strategy is helpful for. It's nice to have a recipe book of strategies for students struggling with various aspects of reading. I was sold when I saw a picture another reviewer posted of the inside of the book (thanks for that). Biggest bang for your buck if you teach primary because of the lower level specific strategies suitable for emergent readers, but this resource will still be super useful when I inevitably teach a junior or intermediate grade. I shared it with my colleagues and everyone ended up buying one. I shared it with a literacy teacher and it looks like my school board will offer a book club on it next year. One of the best books I've ever purchased, for sure.",
    "I have this book so I bought it for a friend as a gift because it’s a great book. BUT the one I received is clearly photocopied, in black-and-white (mine is in colour) hard to read and blurry and much smaller than the actual thing. I am embarrassed to give this as a gift.",
    "This book has been on my wishlist for the longest time and I finally decided to get it! The book came brand new with no pages bent (hate when that happens), and I am beyond excited to read through this. I briefly flipped through the book and noticed it's fully coloured and the paper isn't those cheap thin textbook kind!! Thank goodness!\n\nI can't express how much I love this book already and I know it'll be a great asset in my future teaching.\n\nHighly recommend this book!"

    "First things first. If you are deeply interested in the content of this book, but are weighing whether to make the purchase or not, go to acquisition.com and you can watch Alex personally teach the vast majority of this book's content for absolutely free. There are also handouts you can print out and work through.\n\nDon't let the $1 to $25 investment be an excuse. Alex is literally giving away the knowledge on his website.\n\nI watched the entirety of the video course twice, and still decided to purchase the book just so I could study it and make detailed notes.\n\nI'm currently what Alex would describe as a \"wantrepreneur\". Having worked in public accounting for the past 3 years, I have been obsessing over the idea of starting an accounting business that would help business owners implement the \"Profit First\" system (from Mike Michalowicz's book of the same name), while also providing modern cloud-based bookkeeping and tax services.\n\nThe core of this business model has been firmly developed in my mind for months, but \"$100M Offers\" has taken this from a conceptual fantasy to a legitimate offering I can bring to a specific niche. He has also opened my eyes to the idea of asking for eye-watering amounts of money once your value equation is in a healthy place. My current idea is to have a scaling retainer system (1st client $0 retainer, next 2 clients $1,000 retainer, next 3 client $2,000 retainer, etc.). If the product delivers, people will talk, and people will buy. This kind of a scaling retainer system also builds in some urgency. The sooner you buy, the less you have to put down up front. It mitigates the risk for the clients buying-in prior to an abundance of social proof. But it also quickly adds up to a retainer amount that most CPA's can only dream of charging.\n\nThere are some personal circumstances going on in my life that make starting a business impractical for at least the next couple months (divorce), but in the meantime I am going to do some market research via surveys to my prospective client base to ensure that there is in fact a starving crowd in my niche that needs this accounting solution.\n\nFor the first time in my life, the idea of building a successful business is not a question of \"if\".\n\nNow it's just a question of \"who\".\n\nThanks Alex",
    "I've found this book very inspiring, it made me review for hours my products and offerings (and competitors), realizing the product was great, but the story could be told different and the value of the overall offer could be much better. One of many things I noticed is that Alex talks about being proud in what you do, and I find that an important point that if often omitted in talking about making money and business.\n\nWhenever you get a good product or service, in a restaurant, by someone who fixes your roof, of a dentist, it's a person who is proud in what they do. They deliver a quality product, they are happy to do what they do, they want to help others, and they can demand a high price. Which in essence is what this book teaches, how to make it all sing: Make loads of money, do the right thing, help others flourish, be the best in your field.\n\nI also love that David Ogilvy is included in the description of how to make and present an offer. He's the gold standard in copywriting and making persuasive offers.",
    "Simply put, this is must-read material for every entrepreneur. Alex gives away his best secrets which are not secrets at all, they are fundamental immutable laws of creating a successful offer, product, and business. Moreover, he instills trust and confidence in what he tells you. He lays out his reason for creating this book to create his customer base of successful $3-$5m businesses that he can potentially partner with in the future. Alex has a vested interest in your success, he's done the math, there will be a percentage of businesses that use his methods to go to $5M, and from there, he will partner with you to $50m. The book is the quintessential offer so good you feel stupid saying no to it. As he says, he's giving away better content than you could pay thousands for elsewhere. 100% true.",
    "I have been geeking out on Alex Hormozi for a few weeks since he gave one of the most helpful (and honest) talks at a conference I attended. He has a very rare combination of conviction about helping people, really powerful sales experience, and the ability to speak and write clearly about it.\n\nHe's also a back-to-basics, first principles thinker which means he hits key parts that other people often skip over. I've had books on sales or influence recommended. I've even minored in psychology. However, most books on the subject come across a random scattering of popular sales techniques. In contrast, Alex grounds his book on 1) the dollars and cents business model for how a uniquely valuable offer can improve your business and 2) a compelling model for how people actually value products. Technically, this latter is product advice, but many, many entrepreneurs *think* they need help selling when the difficulty in their sales is that their product has low perceived value. Instead of writing a book only about sales, he includes several helpful chapters from other fields about why people can't sell (evaluating markets and perceived product value being especially key).\n\nThis book is also very clear and actionable. As a coach for overthinking entrepreneurs, this is going to become one of my core recommended books.\n\nThe only two criticisms I have of it are 1) I wish he had more on finding and contacting people in your target audience... but that really is a different subject and 2) The free course episodes that Alex Links to are essentially just the same content in video format. That doesn't really take away from the value of the book, but I didn't find them super useful. For those that like to hear the content, or just watch Alex in all his mustachioed glory, I could see them being helpful.",
    "Firstly this book is tremendous! Secondly this is one of the best investments you are going to make!\n\nAll the information is tried, tested and true. It's completely authentic, realistic and actionable.\n\nSeriously this book will help you define what you want in life, turn your problems into solutions, find your true value, give you the confidence to make more money and help you feel great from start to finish.\n\nThe best way to get the most out of this book is to unf**k your head, believe in yourself, trust the information that's in it and continue to take action. That and read it will listening to the Audiobook, the information is the same but the realisations are superior.\n\nI have tested a number of the concepts in the book and they have already changed the way I am conducting business and they way my customers view the products.\n\nI will be gifting three copies to my colleagues, Two to my coaches and probably another Three for my family.\n\nSo if you're thinking about buying this book (unless you like reading reviews for fun, no judgement)\n\nThen this is your sign, do it for yourself, for those around you and the business that you want to have.\n\ndo it, DO IT NOW!",
    "I’ve been following Alex’s content on YouTube and his podcast for a few weeks and as soon as I heard he has released this book I had to check it out.\n\nI’m only 50% of the way through it and as the title of this review says, I genuinely believe this to be one of the most impactful books I’ve ever read and I haven’t even finished it yet.\n\nThis is the kind of book you read once and then need to re-read so that you don’t miss anything because there are so many amazing golden nuggets of advice in it.\n\nThe beauty of it is it’s actual information than can be implemented as a business owner. It’s granular stuff with real life examples.\n\nI cannot wait to finish reading the rest of the book.",
    "I finished this book in a couple days, along with the free training, it has been eye opening and mind blowing.\nAlex has done what he is teaching (many times over) this is what makes this book really stand out for me, you know you are getting strategies that actually have been tried and tested in a wide variety markets.\n\nThe ideas and understanding you will get that you can implement into your orders, your stack or your on going challenges is amazing, nothing is over looked, no over whelming jargon, just good old fashion straight talk.\n\nI am only new to Alex's teaching but have already seen the benefits of taking action on his teaching.\n\nBuy the book, buy the audio book, buy the Kindle, follow his YouTube channel, follow the Podcast, Follow him in the street, I have no doubt you will learn a lot.",
    "I’ve only read this book once and straight through. I don’t want to undervalue it. For this kind of book to really know the true value I will need to try it out over a period of at least months.\n\nThat said, I’m impressed. Clearly Mr Hormozi has been busy experiencing business early failures and then massively successes . And the formulas here sound like they are won from those experience. So that makes them highly valuable.\n\nEither way at the very least there are some excellent insights into the anatomy of a great offer that I haven’t seen in the same detail elsewhere.\n\nHighly worth a read for any entrepreneur or small business marketer.",
    "I have not an ounce of doubt and can say with complete conviction that this book and the following volumes will be the catalyst for dramatically changing my business and my life for the better. It. Just. Makes. Sense!\n\nAlex. This one will sit on the shelf along with the greats for a long time to come... Covey, Collins, Gerber, Hill, Hormozi\n\nYour generosity is priceless and we will be forever grateful.\n\nCheers Alex and Leila for creating something truly special and raising the bar for us all to strive for."

    "Pacific Gas and Electric reminds me of a cross between Jack Welch's greed with profit and MBAs before everything else and Boeing's complete ineptitude around safety causing the 787 Max crashes. Maybe one of the worse run companies ever. One of the big fires was caused by a 1920's part breaking. I don't know what leaders would keep giving out dividends when their equipment started over 1500 fires in a few short years. They should have focused on maintaining their equipment. It's only a matter of time to disaster. I'm glad the author put this information out there. Companies need to put safety first. Companies need to focus on their customers and not profits. Companies need to quit cutting experienced people and think they can replace them with MBAs. Experience and knowledge matter. The book does also point out the hurt that California is in and will continue to be in with droughts and an aging electrical grid. I'm not sure California was really built to handle all the people it presently has. The story was pretty predictable in you knew the leaders would continue to fail at handling their responsibilities and being accountable but I'm glad this story is out there as a cautionary tale of what not to do.",
    "This book is divided into two parts, with a thirteen main chapters, and a total of about 295 pages, not including Notes/Acknowledgements.\n\nAt the beginning of the book there is a “Cast of Characters”, which includes a list of PG&E executives and employees, politicians, prosecutors, attorneys, wildfire victims, investors, judges, and others mentioned in the book.\n\nThe Prologue starts with a dramatic confrontation, as a victim of one of the wildfires asks some tough questions of the PG&E CEO about restructuring. There are already some gruesome details mentioned here, so the scale of the tragedy really hits home.\n\nPart One begins by covering some of the major events in PG&E’s past. Chapter 1 deals with the Camp Fire disaster and the subsequent FBI investigation. The next few chapters give some history and background about PG&E and California electric companies in general, and the process of deregulation. Blunt covers the Power Exchange, the Enron debacle, and PG&E’s bankruptcy and transformation efforts. She also discusses the San Bruno incident, droughts, and climate change.\n\nPart Two deals with more recent issues. There are chapters about the trial that concluded in 2016, an increase in fires, and a bankruptcy filing in 2019. Blunt covers the 2019 wind-related blackout, and debates over restructuring plans. In Chapter 13 she goes into detail about the June 2020 conviction for unlawfully causing a fire.\n\nI learned quite a bit from reading this book. It is sad to consider how many lives might’ve been saved if certain changes were made sooner. I appreciate Blunt’s exhaustive efforts in getting this information out to the public, and hopefully other companies can also learn from some of these mistakes.",
    "A great book that uncovers major “unintended consequences” of California’s mandated climate control legislation and regulatory agency electric energy supply source policies on the state’s utility delivery systems, customer rates and economy.",
    "Ms Blunt wrote a powerful and concise history of the troubles facing PG&E. She gave a balanced report\non how the various entities affected PG&Es troubles. She avoided getting bogged down in the\nheavy details of such an undertaking, and for the lay reader she laid out the history in a succinct and\nclear message.\n\nAs a long-time shareholder, I appreciated having the facts and accountability presented in a fair and\nunbiased manner. PG&E certainly bares a lot of the blame, but so does the State of California and\nits governmental leaders.\n\nAn excellent read for anyone in the position of management or leadership. Excellent job Ms. Blunt.\nW. Weitzel S.J. CA."

    "Great book that just presents data with additional context sprinkled in instead of just shoving info at you without an explanation of why something is being stated as risky or safe. So interesting to read about what we do and don’t really know for sure about babies.",
    "One of the best parenting books for new parents or parents to be. I am a mother of two grown daughters , a nanny and currently taking training to become certified as a postpartum doula. I wish I had this information when my children were born..C’est la vie.This is one of the 8 required books for the DONA postpartum doula training course. And the best one out of the 8. This would also make a great gift to new parents. It a fun read with important information. A page turner!",
    "Are you tired of garbage science headlines in the news and anecdotal evidence of what will make your baby smarter? Afraid that someone is going to shame you for sleeping in the same bed as your baby? Or for not sleeping in the same room? Besides summarizing the best research on almost every tough decision you'll judge yourself on, Dr. Oster tells you that you don't have to follow the recommendations. Arm yourself with the facts and the numbers. Then make the decisions for yourself taking into account your own mental health. When someone calls you a terrible mother on Facebook, you can relax knowing that you're the one who took into account the data and that idiot on Facebook probably gets their parenting recommendations from Tucker Carlson.\n\nThe book isn't all numbers and cold calculations, though. Especially in this second book, Dr. Oster throws in a lot of anecdotes about how she and those she talked to for the book didn't follow some of the recommendations. Sometimes the data says there's a 1 in 10,000 increase in the chance of death, but they felt like that was a risk they were willing to take because they would be careful. Some risks, as Dr. Oster points out, are probably lower than your chances of dying in a car accident on the way to the hospital...meaning don't worry about them. But do drive carefully to the hospital. It's not like the movies. You can take it easy.\n\nSurprisingly, more than any other book, this one gave me the best impressions of how things were not going to go as planned. She mostly pulls from her own experiences here, and I was surprised how many things went wrong and how many of the normal childbirth and baby care events were very difficult for her and her husband. The stories have more of an impact than just numbers. This is hard even for the best prepared among us.",
    "Emily Oster uses the same data-centered approach in Cribsheet that she did in Expecting Better. (You can read my review of that here.) That’s why I loved Expecting Better so I knew I’d love Cribsheet too. Oster wrote Expecting Better after she had her first child and drew on her own experience of pregnancy for that book. She would present the data and explain why she made the choice she did but was never judgmental about it. The choice was ultimately left up to the reader. Cribsheet is the same, only Oster wrote it after the birth of her second child. She knows from personal experience that all children are different and what works for one may not work for another – even if they have the same parents.\n\nCribsheet covers the most heated topics related to a baby’s first year – sleep training, breast vs. bottle, vaccinations, working vs. staying home, etc. The section on toddlers includes walking, talking, potty training, discipline, education and more. Like in Expecting Better, she presents the various approaches to each topic and then her analysis of the available data, without judgment. My oldest child is 16 years old and my youngest is 18 months old. A lot has changed in 16 years. One example is that it’s now recommended that children sleep in the parents’ bedroom for their first year. This blew me away! My older kids were in their own room within weeks of birth and this was pretty much standard at the time. After reading Oster’s section on sleep, I understood why the recommendation had been put into place and was able to decide how long I thought it was appropriate for my new baby to sleep in my bedroom given the available data.\n\nI hope that Oster continues to write books as her children grow. I’ll be first in line for all of them!",
    "I recommend this book for expecting mothers, although I didn't read it until after my baby was born and it was still incredibly helpful. As a new mom I had a lot of anxiety over all the (mis)information out there about what's safe, what isn't, how to approach the millions of decisions that we have to make constantly when it comes to giving birth and caring for a newborn. As someone who struggles with anxiety already, this could really be overwhelming for me sometimes. This book cuts through all the BS and lets us know what studies were actually done effectively and in such a way to really provide convincing results, versus which studies had too many variables to be taken to heart. The author is an economist and I trust her skill in analyzing and providing feedback. The book was also a very easy and fun read!",
    "I really enjoy the style of writing in this book - I feel like I'm being spoken to by a knowledgable friend and the use of case studies and analysis of data is really reassuring for me as a soon-to-be first-time mom. It's given me different perspectives compared to other courses and books I've read and helped me feel like the decisions I will make as a parent will be right for my family.",
    "The book is very interesting and compiles lots of research on all kinds of child rearing questions.\nI would give a high rating, but the Kindle version is lacking all graphs and lists. The text frequently refers to the graphs, which makes for a very frustrating read!",
    "I haven't read Expecting Better, Emily Oster's previous book, but had high hopes for Cribsheet. Each chapter addresses a different area of parenting \"dilemmas\", relating to a topic that parents often worry about - like, how to feed baby (breast/bottle), is baby's sleep normal and what to do about it, are vaccines safe, etc etc. Oster's writing is snappy and digestible, but she takes a very cool-headed, neutral approach, trying to look at what the scientific evidence says about each topic rather than present a particular \"way of doing things\", as many parenting books do. She steers clear from giving recommendations, unless there is overwhelming evidence for benefit and very little risk, like in the vaccines chapter. There are occasional personal anecdotes which liven things up, although sometimes I think she goes overboard a bit on this. The breast/bottle feeding chapter will probably raise quite a few hackles, because Oster's summary of the scientific evidence is very different from what the \"orthodoxy\" says - she basically notes that there is solid evidence that breastfeeding helps prevent infections, and may have some other benefits too, but many of the longer-term proposed benefits of breastfeeding aren't proven (in her opinion). Therefore, in her view, if you choose to not breastfeed, or switch from breast to formula milk, you aren't choosing a course of action that is depriving your baby of important developmental benefits.\nI felt some of the chapters, like on development, language, and use of TV/ipad were a bit thin, and not as fleshed out as they could be, but maybe that is because the evidence in these areas really is inconclusive. But it would have been nice to have more to say, or to delve into the data a bit deeper to address additional questions (eg, the often claimed suggestion that kids who grow up with more than one language in the home, have other advantages in their development or learning process).\nThe final chapters, on the relationships between parents, and how the adults adjust to becoming parents, was really interesting because so few books on parenting, ironically, actually address this. I felt this was really useful and prescient, and actually validating in a lot of ways. Being a parent can be very stressful at times, and it's nice to have someone (an academic \"someone\") recognise there is real objective data that marital relationships do, on average, suffer when two people have kids. But there are ways to help things, and it does get better (mainly).\nAll in all, I feel this is *not* a how-to manual at all, nor some kind of treatise on parenting philosophy (as so many of these books are), but rather a book that really takes the heat out of parenting - it tells you that there are many different ways to be a great and loving parent. Headlines abound in the media telling us how new scientific studies have \"proven\" that those of us who didn't choose X, or Y, or Z, have ended up failing our kids, but this book tells us that this really isn't so (or isn't proven to be so): it's about understanding your options, and what is right for your family in your circumstances.",
    "Review from a fellow data nerd mum.\n\nEmily Oster has made an admirable attempt at exploring published data on an incredible amount of topics to do with baby and young child rearing. She also draws from her own experience (or at least compares her experience and decisions to the data she describes, leading with a few anecdotes).\n\nUnfortunately, I find the review suffers from a few issues. First, the build-up of topics is not very logical. For a non-US audience, starting the book off with a discussion around circumcision is a bit of a shocker. I think starting off with the data on the vitamin K shot, prolonged cord clamping, or some other issue directly following child birth, would have been a warmer welcome into the book.\n\nSecond, in her attempt to cover every possible topic, she touches on most topics a bit lightly, especially as the book progresses, almost as if she ran out of time. If course, on many topics, there isn't much data to begin with, making this quite a challenge (as is clear from the majority of conclusions - most things don't really have conclusive data). I find the downside is that a few rather important issues which do have reasonable scientific data are not discussed at all. For example, I found it surprising that she didn't discuss the risk of high arsenic levels through rice consumption. In fact she appears to advocate giving young babies rice cereal, which is at best unnecessary (it has virtually no nutritional value) and at worst potentially damaging at high levels.\n\nThird, somewhat related to the previous point, Emily seems to try to use the data to largely justify her own decisions as a parent. Although she is an economist, she is, being a mum, of course not remotely impartial in writing this book. This makes it difficult to do an unbiased review. Although of course an expert in data, perhaps Emily is not best placed to write this book, as she is not an expert in a child psychology or medicine as such. This may be why she has missed a few important topics to discuss.\n\nI do want to congratulate Emily on the enormous effort that has clearly gone into this book. And also on highlighting the need to put an end to mum-shaming which is so damaging and unhelpful to each and every mum. I wholeheartedly agree with her on that one.",
    "This book attempts to do what so few parenting books do, convey parenting advice for new born babies based on medical evidence. The result is an interesting and very useful book, which takes on many parenting myths and shines a light on the data (or not) behind them.\n\nThe main disadvantage of this book for the UK audience is that child-birth in the USA has very different practises to the good old NHS, and the very first chapter in the book - on circumcision! - seems weird and alien, as do the commentaries on practises in US maternity hospitals. Once past that first chapter, though, the focus moves to universal questions which are handled with a direct reference to the evidence and academic lifetime. A useful book and a breath of fresh air. Someone should write a British version!",
    "I lived Oster's pregnancy book and when I found out she had another I had to read it ASAP before making some decisions. These books have made me way more relaxed about parenting because actually what you learn is that for a lot of things science struggles to find one \"correct\" way of doing things. As a new parent you come up against so many people who are scarily dogmatic about their way of doing things. But in truth there are pros and cons for most decisions, with a few hard lines that it is reassuring to know about and stick to. Reading these books will give you the facts you need to make your own decisions with confidence."

    "I believed I was a good leader before reading this book. I believed that I may learn one or two helpful tools, but for the most part I felt like I was in good shape.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nI didn’t realize how spiritually complacent I had gotten in my leading and learning and loving. This book is a MUST READ for all leaders. Groeschel has wrecked my life in the best way, giving me hundreds of things to think through and work on. This book is marked up and highlighted more than any other book I’ve read this year.\n\nI highly recommend this.",
    "Soo good! Churches are seeking answers on how to be more effective in the things that matter most, in one of the most challenging times we have ever seen. This offers solutions and points us back in the right direction to the things that will make us successful in God's eyes. We tend to drift away individually and as churches occasionally, and need to be reminded of what God really wants, and what really works to get us back to Him. It reawakened things in me that had grown cold and confirmed things I felt God had been speaking to me for some time. Now it's time to be intentional about putting it into action.",
    "I loved the first book several years ago and thought that I would like this one as well. Reading this book definitely stirs my soul to strive after that which I believe God has called me to. I can feel IT slipping away recently and don’t want it to fully leave. This book will stir your faith to go after God so that you either gain it back or strive to keep it.",
    "This book confirmed some things I was already doing and revealed things I need to personally address. A great resource for church staff and leadership to read together. When we usually lose ‘IT’ because we did not realize what “IT” was. Now that I have an understanding of what “IT’ is I have better chance of not loosing it and if I do I know that I can get “IT” back.",
    "This is a MUST read for all pastors! My husband and I read this book this week on our spiritual retreat. Very impactful and insightful!",
    "As someone who loved the first addition of this book and read it a few time this one is much better, more throughout, and deeper on the application. By far the best part of the book is the end. A real person being very real with others about what it’s like to lead and live.",
    "I love the emphasis that anyone can move toward better leadership if they want to. It's not some secret thing only some people can have, but it's a gift from God for anyone who will look for it and be willing to learn. Filled with helpful encouragements about the key ingredients of innovation, humility, a spirit of adventure, genuine friendship with teammates, and a healthy outward focus.",
    "This book, along with Winning the war in Your Mind, are !life-changing. Strongly recommend for every leader whose heart is to be filled with Holy Spirit and serve the Lord radically!"

    "\"While the best leaders are not well-rounded, the best teams are.\" That's the big idea in the latest book in the \"StrengthsFinder\" series, Strengths Based Leadership: Great Leaders, Teams and Why People Follow. This is a keeper--and expertly expands the value of focusing on strengths. Gratefully, it's not a rehash--it adds to the knowledge base.\n\nAnd wow! Gallup conducted 20,000 in-depth interviews with senior leaders, then another 10,000 interviews with followers. They have the data! Millions, from more than 50 countries, have taken the online StrengthsFinder assessment. The research-based insights and recommendations plow new ground. For example, \"the most effective leaders are always investing in strengths.\" They write, \"The odds of an employee being engaged are a dismal 1 in 11 (9%). But when an organization's leadership focuses on the strengths of its employees, the odds soar to almost 3 in 4 (73%).\n\nLeadership is nothing without followers and this new book describes the four basic needs of followers: trust, compassion, stability and hope. \"The chances of employees being engaged at work when they do not trust the company's leaders are just 1 in 12.\"\n\nThis is not dry, academic stuff. Four leaders--and their extremely diverse strengths--are profiled, using what they call the four domains of leadership strength: Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building and Strategic Thinking. Example: Wendy Kopp, founder of Teach for America, leverages her Executing strengths (Achiever and Responsibility). Her budget, after just 20 years, is $120 million. She knows the Top-5 Strengths of her key people--and how to leverage those strengths.\n\nOther profiles include the CEO of The Ritz-Carlton (Influencing), the chairman of Standard Chartered Bank (Relationship Building), and the CEO of Best Buy (Strategic Thinking). The core idea for all four very different CEOs: it's all about leveraging the strengths of their team members. \"While the best leaders are not well-rounded, the best teams are.\"\n\nThe research also delivers five findings on what strong teams have in common, such as \"Conflict doesn't destroy strong teams because strong teams focus on results.\" Like the two predecessor books from Gallup (StrengthsFinder 2.0 and Now, Discover Your Strengths), this one also includes a unique access code so you can take the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment online. However, the new-and-improved upgrade delivers your strengths back to you (via email) with new insights on the four domains of leadership strength (Executing, etc.). The book also includes a three-page commentary on each strength and how to address your followers' four basic needs using your Top-5 strengths.\n\nI encourage each CEO I coach to know and leverage the Top-5 strengths of their direct reports and their board chairs. Understanding strengths is not an option, I insist. Instead, it's one of the 20 critical core competencies in the Team Bucket, one of the 20 buckets in my book, Mastering the Management Buckets.  Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit",
    "Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:\n\n1- \"Three key finding emerged from this research: 1) The most effective leaders are always investing in their strengths. 2) The most effective leaders surround themselves with the right people and then maximize their team. 3) The most effective leaders understand their followers' needs.\"\n\n2- \"What great leaders have in common is that each truly knows his or her strengths - and can call on the right strength at the right time. This explains why there is no definitive list of characteristics that describes all leaders.\"\n\n3- \"The Four Domains of Leadership Strength: Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building, Strategic Thinking. We have found that it serves a team to have a representation of strengths in each of these four domains...Although individuals need not be well-rounded, teams should be.\"\n\n4- \"As you can hear int he stories of these four leaders, they have exceptional clarity about who they are - and who they are not. If any one of them had chosen to spend a lifetime trying to be \"good enough\" at everything, it's doubtful they would have made such an extraordinary impact. Instead, they've all been wise enough to get the right strengths on their teams, and this has set up their organizations for continuous growth. Unfortunately, very few teams are truly optimized around their strengths.\"\n\n5- \"What strong teams have in common: 1) Conflict doesn't destroy strong teams because strong teams focus on results. 2) Strong teams prioritize what's best for the organization and then move forward. 3) Members of strong teams are as committed to their personal lives as they are to their work. 4) Strong teams embrace diversity. 5) Strong teams are magnets for talent.\"\n\n6- \"For a team to create sustained growth, the leader must continue to invest in each person's strengths and in building better relationships among the group members.\"\n\n7- \"...followers have a very clear picture of what they want and need from the most influential leaders in their lives: trust, compassion, stability, and hope.\"\n\n8- \"Perhaps the ultimate test of a leader is not what you are able to do in the here and now - but instead what continues to grow long after you're gone.\"",

    "I first listened to this audiobook. It was difficult for me to get into at first, but about half way into the book I began really enjoying the information shared. I decided to buy the paper copy to be able to highlight important information and have on hand during my 5 am journey. I have been able to implement some of the practices and look forward to rereading the book and implementing additional practices.",
    "First of all, The 5am Club is written like a fictional story, and that threw me off a little when I started reading it. The fictional story got a little over the top silly at times, but it kept things interesting, I guess.\n\nBasically, we start with a seminar that’s happening and then follow two main characters as they go on a life-changing trip learning from a billionaire and the teachings of “the Spellbinder.” Again, Sharma keeps things interesting!\n\nThe basic idea of the book is that you’ve got to get up at 5am and start your day off right. Doing this will change your life. He goes into what to do with that time in the morning and then how to kind of focus your day.\n\nI found it inspiring. When I started reading it I was already in the habit of getting up around 5am and doing an hour-long workout program. Since the program is for 80 days, and I don’t have an extra 40 minutes after my workout to do the other two pieces (besides exercise) that he says to do in the morning, I can’t quite start doing what he recommends, but I’m doing my own version of it. I was so inspired by this idea that I am now reading The Miracle Morning as my follow up.\n\nI am NOT a morning person as some people have asked me when I mentioned reading this book. I love my sleep and I hate waking up early. However, as a busy mom with a full-time job and lots going on in my life, I do see (and have experienced) the benefits of getting up early and taking time for yourself in the morning. I am starting to implement some of the things he teaches and hope to continue this practice through the year to see where it takes me!\n\nI didn’t love the style of the book, but I did love the message and recommend this book for anyone interested in personal development.",

    "Having read the Monk who sold his Ferrari and other Robin Sharma books, I was excited at the prospect of reading another. When it arrived and I went on my travels to Sri Lanka, I thought it would be the best travelling companion. This poorly written, badly edited book was a real struggle to get through. Sure the message is a good one, but the ridiculous tale that is loosely woven around the points is frustrating to a point where I almost gave up.\n\nThe language is abysmal, he seems to enjoy coining new phrases and words which are just atrocious and frankly unnecessary. The number of quotes from other people that appear \"on the back of a t-shirt\" or written here and there is such a lazy way of padding out a book and getting a point across. Each character seems to have the memory of an elephant and can recall huge swathes of text verbatim from this famous person or that one.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and buy \"the miracle morning\". It is by far a better book and essentially conveys the same points (but with an even better toolkit for when you go to sleep at night). Sorry Robin, you've seriously missed the mark with this one.",
    "As a Muslim, I have been rising before the sun for many years as I try not to miss my morning prayer. But I have been inconsistent in staying up after doing my morning prayers So, I bought this book to get some practical advice re how I can consistently stay up after the prayers. It has been very helpful and am trying to apply the learning. Still a long way to go but I really loved the book. I wonder whether Robin knows about the morning routine of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Lot of the things I have read hear has been covered in the practical teaching of Prophet Muhammad.",
    "Ever since I joined PGIMER, Chandigarh as a postgraduate resident, automatically I had become a life member of 5 AM Club. Whatever I am today, I attribute it to this 'keystone' habit of mine. Robin Sharma's new book, \"The 5 AM club\" has further reinforced my belief in rising early in the morning.\n\nRobin Sharma has emerged as a master storyteller ever since his first book \"The monk who sold his Ferrari,\" published way back in 1997. I read that book sometime around the year 2000. And ever since then, I have become his ardent fan. I have the entire collection of his books, and personally, I have been benefitted in every walk of my life. (I hope he does not ask for a royalty!)\n\nRobin created a lot of buzz around this new book for the past four years, and he has lived up to the expectations. \"The 5 AM Club\" is not a story. It has all the lessons required to succeed in our personal, family and professional lives. Robin compels us to change for better, with his signature quote, \"Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.\" He has introduced several innovative infographics to help readers understand his masterly concepts as he passionately narrates his story. There are also several cinematic twists and turns to keep the readers bound to the book. And of-course there are many of his game changing formulas. The book can easily be made into a motion picture as it follows Aaron Sorkin's 3-act structure. And now Robin has become a poet also! There are 2 - 3 beautiful poems.\n\nHere are the three most important take-home messages for me from this brand new Robin's page-turner:\n\n1. \"Life's is too short to play small with your talents.\"\n2. \"Your excuses are seducers, your fears are liars, and your doubts are thieves.\"\n3. \"The moment when you most feel like giving up is the instant when you must find it in you to press ahead.\"\n\nRobin has been my Dronacharya, and I hope this review of this Ekalavya for his book will be an apt Guru Dakshina (Royalty!).\n\nDr. Prahlada N.B\nChitradurga.",
    "This book transformed my life. It is packed with strategies and there is an free app you can download once you finish to support you on your journey. The descriptions for each strategy really helps you buy into them, in addition to spiritual thinking on why some things in life don’t work out.\n\nI scanned through the first few pages of the book where it goes into the story of the millionaire, spellbinder, artist and homeless person. The early part of the book was not that interesting for me. I flicked to where it got into the teachings and that’s where the book came alive for me. I’ve never underlined so much in a book!"

    "An inspiring reminder that anyone can be a \"leader\" and that it is a designation of how you act and what you do, not a level in a hierarchy.\n\nFive practices of exemplary leadership\n\nModel the Way - People see and key off what you do and how you role model behavior. In order to do this, you must clarify your values, understand how your values connect with the organization/group you're joining, and be humble and low-ego enough to not ask others to do work you wouldn't do yourself.\nInspire a Shared Vision - Craft a future state that is clear and compelling. It should be detailed enough that others can start to see it for themselves. The best example of this is MLK's \"I have a dream\" speech. Since you can't achieve much on your own, you need others to join your cause and jointly share this vision.\nChallenge the Process - Every great leadership story requires overcoming some obstacles. While inertia is a strong force, you need to identify where changes in process are necessary and enact those changes. It helps to start small and build it through validation.\nEnable Others to Act - Great leaders empower others to step up and become leaders themselves.\nEncourage the Heart - There is an \"inspiring\" quality to leaders who can tap into a deep human motivation. People also being led by positive, encouraging people who make them feel valued and appreciated.\n\nWhat people look for in a leader\n\nHonesty - says what they believe to be true (not two faced), speaks the hard truths\nFuture thinking - spend time thinking about and the future and have a stance on where things are going\nCompetent - do what they say they will do\nInspiring - evoke a higher purpose",
    "One of the prides of my library is my copy of The Leadership Challenge: How to Get Extraordinary Things Done in Organizations by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner, which I bought back in 1987. It’s a 1st edition.\n\nTom Peters wrote the foreword. My first underlinings are in the preface, and there are so many little post-it tabs stuck in the sides that it looks like a yellow forest. Each of those tabs represents one or more underlinings of a key idea.\n\nThe Leadership Challenge is truly a business book classic. But as amazing as the book I own is, and as much value as I’ve gotten from it, it’s not the book I go to today when I’m looking for a comprehensive overview of how leaders work in organizations. For that, I go to the 6th edition of this same book. The 6th edition is a different book from the 1st edition, and it’s a better book. It’s the result of what the authors have learned along the way. Here’s the way they put it.\n\n“With each new edition, we get clearer about the leadership actions that make a difference. We reiterate what's still important, discard what's not, and add what's new. We contemporize the framework and freshen up the language and point of view so that the book is highly relevant to current circumstances and conditions. And, we are more authoritatively prescriptive about the best practices of leaders. The more we research and write about leadership, the more confident we become that leadership is within the grasp of everyone. The opportunities for leadership are boundless and boundaryless.”\n\nMost business book classics are written once, and then stay pretty much the same forever. They’re classics because they continue to deliver value. This book is different because the authors have taken the time, made the commitment, and done the work to make each edition better than the last. If there’s a 7th edition, I’ll buy it.",
    "This is a great book for anyone looking to gain some tips, tricks, and insights on management and leadership. I've been a manager for 20 years and it is a good reminder on how to get more from your direct reports, and help to make sure everyone's on the same page. Great resource for experienced managers and BSBA students alike!",
    "I am in an Organizational Leadership Masters program and this is one of the main textbooks for one of my classes. I find myself completely immersed while I am reading, and I look FORWARD to reading (which is rare with \"textbooks!\"). This book answers all every single question I have had about why my leadership was struggling or failing in the past - providing concrete examples and case studies of people who successfully applied the principles. The authors write well, they inject humor, and their enthusiasm is contagious. If you own a small business, if you are a teacher/facilitator of any kind, if you do project management, or if you lead any kind of team, YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. There are a million books out there, but this one is so approachable, so practical, so fun and easy to read, and it's in its 6TH EDITION. That says a lot. Not only does it mean that people keep wanting to read this book, but it also means that the information is totally up to date, describing leadership scenarios we are all dealing with right now, in 2019. Thank you Kouzes and Posner. Amazing work. You have given me hope, reinvigorated my sense of purpose, and provided me with applicable practices I can use within my teams, projects, and organization.",
    "I’m happy I discovered this book. Although originally written some time ago, I love the updates the author has done but even without them, this book would still be relevant.\n\nI am planning to use this book not just as reading material but as reference material. I am positive that I’ll be coming back to it time and time again.",
    "I was recommended this book by a business coach and it really delivered. A huge amount of what is in here can be seen as the foundations in many leadership courses and seminars. Really inspiring, useful and straightforward. Best book I have read on this subject.",
    "Just got a quick look into the book and already in love with it. Very well written, simple language that doesn’t need to feel tired of reading. It will def help me with my master!",
    "Thank you for the prompt delivery and in good condition. I have almost read the book it's a very good read and what I like about it, is that it gives accounts of people who are just like you and I and not mega stars in any given field. Thoroughly enjoying the book. Thank You.",
    "An easy read, relatable examples. Perfect for what I needed it for",
    "Inspiring and just want you need to enhance your understanding of modern leadership."

    "The United States of America has fallen so far and so fast in the less than two years of Biden's regime that it beggars belief. As with most things similar, it's a natural human tendency to try to describe this adverse event to coincidence or incompetence. But a principle I learned as U S army combat officer has been nagging at me the entire time. if something happens once it can be an incident, twice a coincidence, but three or more times it's due to enemy action. The string of adverse events starting with COVID has crippled the USA and the free world and bodes much worse in the future. While we can’t be sure that its release in Wuhan was accidental or deliberate, we do know that its rapid spread worldwide was deliberately fashioned. What was astonishing was how the so-called elites responded by ruthlessly suppressing scientists and others who discussed natural immunity and effective therapeutic treatments. This wasn’t accidental and went way beyond coincidence; could it merely be incompetence? But then some intrepid people following the money were branded as conspiracy nuts. Next, the 2020 election was “managed” and the Afghanistan withdrawal was botched. More incompetence? Adverse event followed adverse event until it was impossible for any reasonable person to not entertain the notion of causation. Now Kevin Freeman has produced “According to Plan” that ties together the deep roots behind current events, roots that stretch back to Khrushchev pounding his shoe at the UN and U.S. mainstream journalism morphing from factual reporting to “analysis”. Freeman goes step-by-step in bite-sized chunks through a huge number of the facets that brought us to the point where the COVID “plandemic” kicked off a long-developed globalist plan to remove the USA as the main obstacle to their grand design. Read this book to understand how we got where are. So, what are we going to do about it? Freeman addresses that as well, stressing that the unlimited power seized by the current US regime (whoever runs it) must be curtained. He lays out practical steps within the US Constitution. I would argue that his basic thesis is that these incompetent Pigs (to use his “1984” analogy) prematurely took the wraps off and we still have a limited time to reverse their deliberate destruction of the USA and enslavement of its people. Will it be enough? We’ll never know if we don’t try. Please read this book; the preface by Ben Carson alone is worth the price."

    "I liked the author’s podcast interview by the respected, data-driven and the whimsical Mad Fientist. I bought this book for two important reasons: it was self-published and the author’s persistent reference to Jack Bogle’s genius. I support self-published financial authors because the traditional publishers deploy editors to tweak the author’s voice, and original story, to make the final “processed” book more sellable. Instead, self-published authors do not have to satisfy shareholders or generate sales, so the author’s message about Bogle’s investment philosophy and the company he founded, Vanguard, remains organic for the readers’ best interest.\n\nThis book is perfect for beginners, and some seasoned investors who are sick and tired of searching for that short-term investment miracle. Collins stuck with Bogle’s purest message from the beginning to the last word. As a Bogle devotee myself, I appreciate his courage to stand up, write a terrific book and argue effectively for the powerful and low-cost indexing strategy and against the delusional appeal of day-traders, hedge fund managers, active management strategies, timers, or individuals who claim they can successfully speculate and win big. Far too many normal investors get caught up in those phony, but exciting fantasies and lose. The new guy or gal investor gets the skills to construct a simple portfolio you understand, and then have the courage and the confidence to permanently ignore the media’s seductive financial noise machine.\n\nThe Simple Path to Wealth's basic message to beginners is well-known in the Do It Yourself (DIY) and ESPECIALLY for the Youthful Financial Independence (aka FI and FIRE Financial Independence Retire Early) community.\n• think long-term\n• live below your means\n• plan ahead with a fully diversified portfolio (except international stocks, more on this below)\n• invest in Vanguards low-cost index funds\n\nSooooo, what is not to like? I’ll admit it’s a boring plan, and not all DIYers embrace it. But I love my boring plan and it’s exactly where the power of what we can do lies—after setting up our plan, we must be patient.\n\nCollins writes much about psychology, for good reason. The power lies with us. It's not us versus the big intimidating stock market. With time and experience, we learn to be psychologically tough for long periods of time. In the movie Wizard of OZ, Glenda told Dorothy that she “always had the power to go home again?” It's the same for us investors. All of the features of constructing a balanced plan remains under our control. It fairly easy to learn. But the hard part is the unfair and counterintuitive psychology. Thinking long-term is the best antidote. Over time the growth will pay enough of a return to meet or beat the inflation rate. Meeting or beating inflation is a simple, realistic goal, and psychologically attractive. This book shows you how to like saving with minimal time and effort to discover the investing process.\n\nPatience, psychology, and philosophy are a difficult sell. Many investing aficionados are more interested in the adrenaline rush and chasing the opposite sex than building wealth over time. The market is not something to conquer or control. It is simply made up of wonderful organizations of hardworking people, called publicly traded corporations. The author explains how to harness all of that positive corporate energy, and just flow with it, whether it goes up or down, and over time it goes up. The author addressed the tough sell challenge with elegance and subtle toughness.\n\nThe author discusses investment costs, taxes, tax-deferred retirement plans offered by employers, the retirement years and strategies to keep from running out of money. My favorite chapters are “Why I don’t like Investment Advisers” and “Some final thoughts about risk.” Financial advisers are an easy target with hundreds of reasons not to like. Most of us DIYers will never need a financial adviser, for two good reasons: Collins writes “Nobody cares about your money more than you do,” and “you can learn to manage your money yourself with far less cost and better results.” From my personal experience, knowing how to save investment costs alone was enough to pay cash for the Tesla Model S.\n\nOn the subject of risk, my favorite part, and I quote as the author was speaking to the zombie apocalyptics among us especially the financial media: “Major Armageddon extinction events, like the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago, have happened about five times. So that’s about one every 10 million years or so. Are we really arrogant enough to think it’s going to happen in the geological eye-blink we’ll be around? That we’ll be the ones to witness it? Not likely.” Economic Armageddon ain’t going to happen either.\n\nThere are a few minor omissions. The author is not well known, so he needs to talk more about himself about what he did. I felt like he had more to say as examples of his fears of risk and the mistakes he made. All of that would have made the book even more authentic and organic. What was the role of his wife? What exactly did the author and his wife do for a living? He did report that he worked as a financial analyst. So, was he in the financial industry? He did not explain why he had an overly aggressive portfolio for an individual in his 60s. He did not share his diversification plan, except that he doesn’t own international stocks (he explains why).\n\nConsequently, I give him an A for telling us how to set up a portfolio and his rationale, but I give him a B for not showing what exactly he did and for how long. His rationale is spot on, but portfolio construction and asset allocation strategies and information can be found in many books (The Boglehead Guide to Investors, any book written by Jack Bogle or his followers, Ferri, Swedroe, Roth, and Bernstein).\n\n• Some other minor items that I found perplexing and discouraging for people starting out. On page 246, he writes, “Save and invest at least 50% of your income.” What? I reread this twice, and could not comprehend why the author wrote this. In my working career, I could not even contribute the maximum allowed in my 403(b) plan let alone save 50% of my income (No, I never had new car payments because I could not afford car payments and invest too). Yet, I reached financial independence at age 61. 50% of one’s income is overreaching and dangerously discouraging (unless you are a highly elite and talented employee with a 7 figure income). For the rest of us, just start with what you can afford. For example, I started at age 37 with $200 a month in my 403(b), and that was a lot out of my meager income. But I kept it up for 24 more years.\n\n• Back to his strategy about avoiding international stocks. The author knows he will get pushback, and he probably has heard my argument for international investing many times. Mr. Collins is just following Bogle's advice about keeping it simple. But one can have it both simple and fully diversified worldwide by one fund. Diversification means investing in all available stocks, worldwide. So, let’s take advantage of these opportunities to invest in just one fund, the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT). The author won’t have it. IMO, the author might be reflecting his age and the Familiarity/home bias that is so frequent with the silent generation. The author writes investing in the United States domestic market is enough diversification because of the worn-out 21st-century global connections argument. He offers what appears at first glance valid reasons, but they are out-of-date, and one about excessive costs is flatly wrong. Vanguard's Global fund charges .14%. I don’t know about you, but the opportunity to invest in all publically traded companies on the planet is inexpensive!\n\nAlso, I am 74 years old and old enough to remember my elders saying that is too risky to invest in foreign stocks. We are well into the 21st century and the world has changed. Don’t you think that international corporations want to grow and prosper too? Of course. Don’t you think opportunities for diversification have evolved for the better? Yes. I want as much diversification as possible to reduce equity risk, and reduce volatility. I might even get higher returns, but that’s not part of my expectations. The global index funds or ETFs make full diversification in just one investment a synch.\n\n• Another minor objection is his downplaying the Roth IRA. I think he over-complicated with trying to predict the tax rate to decide to use or not use the Roth IRA. It’s futile and a waste of time to guess the future. Not having to pay capital gains taxes after investing in the Roth IRA is one of the best strategies for us regular investors (You can run the numbers on a brilliant Excel program created by The Finance Buff). After running the numbers on the Excel program, you will be thoroughly convinced to include the Roth IRA in your plan.\n\n• One last objection. I recommend to readers who don’t have a “lump sum” that is, a bundle of money to invest already, that you ignore the “Why I don’t like dollar-cost averaging” chapter. I had to use DCA during my entire working career investing in my 403(b). Because I started from NOTHING and had less than $50,000 for years. If you have a lump sum to invest, follow the author’s advice. But I think I can speak for most investors who have little choice but to use DCA. His opinion about DCA was more discouraging than encouraging.\n\nCollin’s strong opinions about some of his investment ideas represent more of his individuality than sound investment practice. Of course, the author never intended to be discouraging. I am just responding as a reader with a few of my opinions about his outstanding work. That’s perfectly fine for him as his opinions worked for him and they might work for you too. My opinions worked well for me. In the final analyses, he follows the “Boglehead” way. For that, I am delighted he wrote a great self-published book showing once again the work of the legendary investor, advocate, and teacher, Jack Bogle. Outside of these minor differences of opinion, Mr. Collins earned a well-deserved five stars.\n\nIn sum, if any author self-publishes a book about investing, I think it is important to readers to know that the message is organic—no other agenda item hangs in secret, other than to explain and layout a simple plan which will connect with new investors and get them results.",
    "My husband and I finally woke up at 50 to realize we were not even close to ready for retirement and completely uneducated about finance, asset buckets, retirement accounts, investment accounts etc. etc. Basically scared and totally overwhelmed!\nWe realized we needed to educate ourselves yesterday. Either that or work until we were dead.\nStarted pouring over YouTube and devouring ever finance book we could read.\nSpent two years self educating, racked up hundreds of study hours, which lead to completely reorganizing the investments in my husbands 401k (I’m still totally sick over how much money in fees we’ve lost over the years in not having our 401k invested properly).\nBesides readjusting our 401k we also maxed out our Roth’s, HSA’s and purchased rentals instead of a single family house.\nWe also started living way below our means, no debt, all cash, or don’t buy it. Mortgages being the exception.\nNeedless to say, we started at 50, now we’re both 60 and retired and everything worked out beautifully.\nWhat I didn’t realize is that I could have saved myself almost two years of frantic study and stress if I had simply read this book to start with!!!\nI’m bummed we didn’t find the book sooner, but on the other hand we were thrilled to discover we had come up with the same conclusions and plan in this book.\nThat being said, even if I had read the book first I would have wanted all that study just to make sure it was correct, and believe me it is! At our age we could NOT afford to make any mistakes.\nThe finance world and the financial advisors want you to believe all this is VERY complicated, it’s not, it can be very easy and almost set it and forget it. I say this as it applies to the average mid-income, middle class investor. Obviously if you’re worth millions your world gets far more complicated!\nI’ve now purchased this book for my children and all of our friends. It really is fantastic and simplifies the entire subject of investment.\nIt does not really touch on real estate though. If you have “time” you really don’t need to own the real estate and be a landlord if it’s not your thing. You could easily be financially independent following just the advice in this book. In our case we chose to buy rentals to not only diversify our portfolio, but to add to our cash flow on top of Social Security. Having the real estate income also allows us to not have to dip into our stock (Index funds) compounding interest longer.\nBuy the book, you won’t regret it!\nPS. I also followed “Our Rich Journey” on YouTube. I’ve found a lot of there advice to be very sound. Good luck on your journey to financial freedom, it’s worth it!!!!",
    "This book is a game changer for anyone looking to learn and start financial independence. JL Collin shares a simple and straightforward path on how to start your financial independence journey. The lessons provided are, as some have pointed out, basic and simple but that is what makes it so valuable. As a beginner you are not overwhelmed with financial terms and complex plans. JL Collins with his calm and guiding voice (audio book) provides you with plain-spoken foundational information that allows you to create your base knowledge of financial independence. Once you have that foundation built, you can then pursue higher level financial independence strategies and adjust your plans to meet your life's journey.\n\nI bought the book for my siblings and have shared with them the numerous videos you can find online of JL Collins being interviewed about this book and his financial independence philosophies. I go back to this book continually to remind myself of the base-knowledge as I pursue my financial independence. I highly recommend this book.",
    "I've been devouring financial self-help and working on my financial literacy but, while the books I've read had valuable information about mindset shifts one needs to make to grow wealth, none were as helpful in terms of practical instructions for beginners like myself. Hands down one of the most tactically helpful books I've ever read.",
    "Who would’ve thought it’d be as simple as VTSAX and chill? I’m glad he updated the book to 2020. The Next Door Millionaire is also good but the numbers are from 1990s so the prices of goods like cars and houses are way off from 2022. Highly recommend if you’re into personal finance!",

    "J. L. Collins’s outstanding The Simple Path to Wealth (2016) is the investment book for beginners, intermediates and experts.\n\nCollins’s message is to find financial freedom: the ability to never work again, if you don’t want to, and have enough money “F-you money” that your investments provide appropriate income for you to retire early and live comfortably. The book’s majority focuses on a simple investment strategy. Collins’s simple strategy is all an investor ever need. He also provides clear, pithy advice on how to live, such as “Avoid debt”. Simple yet telling. What surprised me most, and what I benefited from the most, was his reassuring view to the behaviour of investing. He tells the truth at every stage, and doesn’t pull any punches, such as the market will drop, and you will see your investments half. But, as always, he’s the anchor of sanity, and says we need to hold our nerve when that happens, to actually buy more during those downturns and ride out the bad times, as the good times come a lot more often and provide great returns.\n\nThe highlight here is Collins’s experienced, uncle’s voice. He writes in a way that is friendly and smart. A voice to trust. Collins’s been there, made the mistakes, dusted himself off and seen the light; it’s almost as if he took the hard route in order to pass on his knowledge so that we don’t need to make the same mistakes, and we can follow him on the right path.\n\nThe Simple Path to Wealth is a rare book that is both thoroughly enjoyable and wise in its teaching. I adored reading every word and learning everything I need to know about investing in the stock market. I’d recommend this book to everyone, but especially people who say, “I know nothing about stocks and shares.” All they need to do is read this short book and follow its simple message. A superb book in a sea of unhelpful, impenetrable finance books.",
    "You have to bear in mind that this book was written with U.S. investors in mind, but the principles are the same. (Obviously ignore the chapter on tax as UK rules will be totally different) It's written in very simple terms and is easy to understand for the non professional investor. It makes you realise you can invest very successfully, very cheaply, and with very little hassle, without having to be an expert, and without having to continually monitor your investments. In fact it becomes quite clear that the less you monitor / fiddle the better your outcome is likely to be.",
    "I first heard of this guy after stumbling across an interview he did with 'Google Talks' or something like that on YouTube and I really liked his demeanour and straightforward but friendly advice on investing. So I checked out his blog site and ordered the book. As someone who is brand new to investing, it's really refreshing to read such an engaging book that although is very US-centric in parts, still holds some very valuable information and advice for those starting out or even more seasoned investors. Collins' style is warm, witty and engaging and I will certainly be revisiting this again.\n\nWell worth your 'investment' :-)",
    "Amazing book - a thoroughly enjoyable read and the most comprehensive guide to investing and financial independence. JL Collins genuinely wants to impart his years worth of investing knowledge to make life more rich and secure for all. I wish I had read this book years ago, but feel so fortunate that I've read it at all. As others have mentioned, it's very US focused, but the principles hold well and if you follow them your life will absolutely be better off for it.",
    "This book's advice is more or less consistent with personal finance community's wisdom, but summarised in one short book.\n\nThe proposed portfolio - 1 ETF for wealth accumulation stage and 2 ETFs for wealth preservation stage - is much simpler than what the majority of people have.\n\nThe downside is that a lot of specifics the book covers, especially on tax optimization, are tailored to America, but author offers enough guidance that you could implement the same ideas in any other country."

    "Tim Ferriss is where it all started for me, the concierge of knowledge. One day I began reading Tools of Titans and it led me to his podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show, the first podcast I’ve ever listened to. And now few years later all the podcasts and book recommendations that began from Ferriss and his guests have contributed into a healthier, happier, and more mindful lifestyle for me.\n\nAlong the way, I read the Tools of Titans twice, read Tribe of Mentors, listened to a shitload of his podcast episodes, listened to many more podcasts that interviewed him (the one on Cal Fussman’s podcast is my favourite), and I of course subscribed to his 5-bullet Friday. But I’ve never read this book yet, the OG of Tim Ferriss’ philosophy. Until now.\n\nAs Ferriss himself admitted in one of his many interviews, he has since evolved away from some of the ideas in this book. He said that some points even become irrelevant and obnoxiously wrong (although for the life of me, I cannot tell which ones).\n\nBut still, it’s the last (or to be exact, first) piece to complete Ferriss' jigsaw puzzle of philosophy. It provides the big picture on everything that he believes in and his tools and methods to do them. Funny how his first book is the last one that I read but somehow can neatly summarized everything that he’s been doing for so many years. Now that’s consistency.\n\nSo what’s the book really about? In a sentence: eliminate, simplify, automate, and delegate.\n\nIt is a fun, weird, witty and very informative book, written in an unmissable Tim Ferriss signature approach: having out-of-the-box hypotheses, test them himself (the ultimate human guinea pig), and then he provides us with references for links, types of gadgets or devices used, and many other list of stuffs that work out.\n\nThe book is also full of tips and tricks with plenty of real-life stories and case studies, to assist us in so many things in life - from minimalism, to organising our day, to building a business - in a pretty detailed manner that makes the book a true guidebook for a lot of practical things.\n\nBut it is not one of those “get rich quick and retire young” kind of scam, as the title of the book might implies. But instead, it's about making our work efficient and automated in order to free up time for us to pursue other things, such as our bucket list or simply to live a relaxed life. This, is the core premise (or the goal) of the book.\n\nIndeed, contrary to most personal finance books, the goal of this book is not necessarily to get rich monetarily. As Ferriss remarks, “Gold is getting old. The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.” That’s right, the goal is instead to have an abundance amount of the most precious commodity: time.\n\nOne of the ideas that Ferriss advocates is to have “mini retirements” spread out over our lifetime, rather than having a big finale at the end of our lives (when we’re already old and not in our prime physical years) or to retire young (which is an unrealistic option for a lot of people). And as Ferriss shows in the book, mini retirements doesn’t have to cost a lot of money, and we can still do it while still functioning and doing an efficient work.\n\nAnother idea that stands out from the book is the way Ferriss approaches any goal in low-risk attainable steps. For example, we can micro testing our product before launching to get the immediate feedback, or borrowing the puppy before we committed to adopt, or postponing our education rather than dropping out entirely (or the work equivalent for it) so that if things don’t work out we can always go back.\n\nBecause “Reality is negotiable” explains Ferriss, and “Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or broken, and it doesn’t require being unethical.” And the book has this stretching feel about negotiating reality out of the usual norm.\n\nThe funny thing is, the book looks like a perfect precursor before the pandemic, because it is exactly what eventually happens to a lot of people, especially for the remote office thing. Had I read this earlier, I would’ve been skeptical of the feasibility of the ideas in this book. But as it turns out, it is proven to be effective during the pandemic and the ideas in the book are working out very well in this era of new normal.",
    "I had seen the uber-orange cover of The 4 Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss all over: Bookstores (duh!), backseats of cars, airplane terminals, frat houses and more. Yet despite its proliferation into the hands (and Kindles) of millions of people all over the world, and its catchy headline, I had yet to read it. In fact, I had no inclination to read it whatsoever.\n\nQuite frankly, I had no idea what it was about. Plus the title made it sound like it belonged on an infomercial and not in my book collection.\n\nThings changed when I started listening to the Tim Ferriss Show podcast just a few weeks ago. The podcast is fantastic and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it; I highly recommend it.\n\nFrom what I’ve noticed, if I enjoy reading someone’s articles or website, I generally enjoy their podcasts (the same holds true vice-versa). So when I saw that it was available for only $1.99 on Kindle I didn’t hesitate one bit.\n\nCan I really only work 4 hours?\n\nThat’s what everyone wants to know. For the most part, no it is not feasible for most. In fact, Tim repeats in his podcasts and presumably other mediums that The 4 Hour Workweek is not to be taken literally. Rather, it drives the point home of what the book is really about: Optimizing your time, eliminating distractions, and finding passive streams of income to allow you to do minimal work while having maximum freedom.\n\nIt’s a solid concept. In fact, there really is little basis for the traditional 9-5 schedule:\n\nHow is it possible that all the people in the world need exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn’t. 9– 5 is arbitrary.”\n\nThe idea behind this book is to essentially turn the idea of working hard on its head:\n\nBeing busy is a form of laziness— lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective— doing less— is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.”\n\nMany books of this nature are simply filled with fluff, woo-woo, and other law of attraction platitudes, but The 4 Hour Workweek is absolutely filled to the brim with productivity tips. This makes the book worth the price of admission alone (that goes for the full price hardcover too!)\n\nThere are a few concepts that he really stresses throughout the book and that will allow you to eliminate and optimize.\n\nThe first of which is the 80/20 principle, also known as the Pareto Principle. This principle states that 80% of results (profit, happiness etc.) comes from 20% of output. Once Tim discovered this principle, he applied it to his nutritional supplement company so that he could focus on the select few clients that brought him the bulk of his income, and to eliminate the pesky customers who were nothing but trouble.\n\nSure, it cost him some income, but it allowed him to reduce his stress exponentially and freed up a plethora of time.\n\nA second major principle is Parkinson’s law, which states:\n\n… that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill.”\n\nThe best approach to Parkinson’s Law is to\n\n1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/ 20).\n\n2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.”\n\nThere are a plethora of other tidbits of wisdom throughout, such as:\n\nCheck e-mail twice per day, once at 12: 00 noon or just prior to lunch, and again at 4: 00 P.M.\nAt least three times per day at scheduled times [ask] the following question: Am I being productive or just active?\nMore is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it.\nGetting Your Own Personal Assistant\n\nOne of the most engaging and laughable topics in the book was the chapter on virtual assistants (VA). I say laughable because it’s actually incredibly feasible to have a 3rd world virtual assistant, and I couldn’t help myself from laughing at the idea of having a team of Indians heeding my every beck and call.\n\nConsider this:\n\nIf you spend your time, worth $ 20-25 per hour, doing something that someone else will do for $ 10 per hour…”\n\nMakes sense. Plus there are other good reasons to consider getting a VA:\n\nGetting a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn how to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the most critical of NR skills: remote management and communication.”\n\nThe Original Internet Entrepeneur\n\nWhen I began to read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, I noticed something: I had read this before. But it wasn’t because Aurelius was plagiarizing content 2000 years in the future, rather it was the inverse.\n\nI’ve noticed this phenomena with The 4 Hour Workweek in that much of the content seemed all too familiar with the Digital Nomad and lifestyle design communities and advice of today. But seeing as it was written originally in 2007, one could say it was the first of its kind.\n\nIn fact, the proliferation of internet entrepreneurs are likely a result of this book.\n\nOn that note, look where Tim Ferris is today. He’s not lounging on a beach in Guatemala making money off his supplements. Rather, he’s busting his ass in Silicon Valley helping startups turn into massive success stories.\n\nThis is no fault of his; I just think many readers of this book and these internet entrepreneurs lose sight of this. They get caught in finding ‘passive income’ and settling for 1-3K a month; just enough to make do in a foreign country of their choice.\n\nThis is what I wanted for so long, but now this doesn’t seem like enough. I’d much rather be doing what Tim is doing now as opposed to what he recommend in his book.\n\nDon’t Follow This Book Like the Gospel\n\nAgain, the 4 Hour Workweek isn’t designed to be taken literally. This is a pattern throughout the book.\n\nIn fact, much of the information regarding internet marketing and asking a boss for a remote work agreement is completely useless for me and may be for you. Yet, overall I was really impressed with the book. There was plenty of solid, actionable advice throughout. In fact, I’ve already marked this book down as one I will have to read again to internalize the concepts that stood out to me.\n\nhttp://masculinebooks.com/2015/05/26/the-4-hour-workweek-by-tim-ferriss/",
    "Total and utter waste of words on paper - too many words at that, and too many papers.\n\nI've listened to Tim's podcasts for good few years, and respect his interview skills and the type of people he invites.\nBut that does not make him a writer - if that were the criteria then all radio/tv broadcasters/new-readers/weather-reporters will be writers too. Too much content thrown into the book in a false hope something somewhere may be of use to someone.",

    "The Economist magazine calls this a \"first-rate\" business book and I agree. Charles Duhigg tells of people - individuals, businesses, and other organizations - who carry out routines and act on habits in recurrent situations. The book puts a spotlight on people who succeed at shedding some habits and bringing new ones to life - in themselves and in people around them. In these pages lie a powerful concept and illustrative stories.\n\nHabits can be efficient. When a habit is activated, we don't have to think so much about all the steps and breaths we take. Habits can be simple or more complex, making short work of such activities as: brushing one's teeth while thinking about the workday ahead; driving a car while listening to the radio; or tending to customers, fielding their requests, and responding routinely in a warm, appreciative manner. Routines can do a lot of good when it comes to maintaining desirable habits. But things can get challenging when we would like a habit to be changed.\n\nA big part of the value in this book is its parade of human stories about how people have succeeded in replacing old habits with new ones. There are a few stories, too, about people who tried but failed to change a bad habit. Along the way, the author sketches a do-it-yourself model. He talks about people identifying existing \"habit loops\" which may include external triggers of time, place, people, and situations. Then, the idea is to interrupt and redirect activity toward the desired goals, eventually forming new habits.\n\nIn some examples, small \"wins\" are shown leading to bigger wins as people build skills and confidence in new ways of doing things. And in stories of organizational or cultural habits, positive changes are shown sometimes to set off a ripple effect, where new habits spread to more people in a kind of social contagion.\n\nCharles Duhigg is a New York Times journalist and a graduate of Harvard Business School. He draws together a sampling of psychological research and real-life examples in business and other organizational endeavors. \"The Power of Habit\" delivers Duhigg's report in the form of a book full of good stories about people who exemplify the concept of \"habit\" in action, including direct interviews with some of the players in the stories. With this Duhigg presents a psychological concept of habits that a general audience might apply in everyday business and personal life. This book, if it reaches a large readership, may follow in the grooves of what journalist and psychologist Daniel Goleman's books did to popularize \"emotional intelligence\" and \"EQ.\" (Goleman focuses on business applications of emotional intelligence in his 1998 book,  Working with Emotional Intelligence .)\n\nDuhigg's stories are interesting in their own right, easy to understand, and memorable. They run the gamut from sports to neurosurgery, and from marketing toothpaste to overhauling the managerial culture of a heavy industrial corporation.\n\nFor example, chapter 2 \"The Craving Brain: How to Create New Habits,\" showcases breakthroughs in consumer marketing (and in one case, the dental health of a whole society) connected to habit changes. The examples cover a variety of marketing obstacles and breakaway solutions including Pepsodent toothpaste, Schlitz beer, and Febreze household deodorizer.\n\nChapter 5, \"Starbucks and the Habit of Success: When Willpower Becomes Automatic,\" talks about staff training programs that have been credited with enhancing customer service and tuning up whole organizational cultures. Examples besides Starbucks include Deloitte Consulting and the Container Store.\n\nPerhaps the most colorful and intriguing business story in the book is about the managerial successes of Paul O'Neill when he was CEO of the aluminum company Alcoa. (He later went on to serve as U.S. Treasury Secretary.) This is told mostly in Chapter 4, \"Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neill: Which Habits Matter Most.\" When O'Neill became CEO of Alcoa in 1987, he spearheaded the company on a headlong drive to achieve an error-free standard of employee safety. He rallied employees up and down the hierarchy, and across functions, to the cause of becoming \"the safest company in America... [despite that]... employees work with metals that are 1500 degrees and can rip a man's arm off.\" (p. 98)\n\nAt first, Alcoa's investors and employees alike were skeptical, seeing O'Neill's radical quest for superiority in employee safety as too narrow, quixotic, and off-center. O'Neill conceived of the safety charge as a focal point that would trigger all sorts of changes in routines and habits of accountability throughout the company. Preventing employee injuries became a \"keystone habit\" in Duhigg's lingo, that would set off a ripple effect leading to an upswing in total corporate performance.\n\nIt worked. Within a year, Alcoa's profits reached an all-time high. Over a 13-year run with O'Neill at the helm, profits and the stock price both increased by 400%. Time lost to worker injuries declined to one-twentieth the U.S. average. Duhigg's book cites interviews with O'Neill himself and other Alcoa people who were there, and mentions that Alcoa stands as a case study in business schools.\n\n\"The Power of Habit\" shines a bright light on organizational habits, but not only that. Duhigg serves up stories that point to individual habits, with relevance for personal success, such as interrupting a snacking habit or ending addictions. I see Duhigg's concept of habit loops as compatible with and complementary to the work of food and marketing psychologist Brian Wansink in his excellent book,  Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think  (2006). At the other end of the scale, Duhigg talks about habits changing at a societal level of attitudes and behavior, offering an analysis of the civil rights movement's Montgomery bus boycott as an example.\n\nThe one disappointment I find is a lack of chapter summaries and sub-chapter headings. While the book certainly is accessible \"as is,\" such aids would make it easier to tie together diverse examples, remember themes and links, and go back to them later. The Audible.com version in particular is harder going without summaries and sub-headings because one is not looking at pages with the chapter heading in the upper right, nor is the listener just a page flip away from glancing at the book's table of contents. The Audible.com version also could do a better job of mentioning the printed book's many visual diagrams for listeners who are interested enough to cross-refer.\n\nThe book begins and ends with fitting references to the 19th-century writings of an American philosopher and psychologist, William James, who elucidated the concept of habit before there was much science behind it. James was a prime mover in establishing two major streams of modern social science and philosophy: 1.) behavioral psychology - that is, putting a scientific focus on observable behavior and developing interventions to help people shape their lives according to their better ideals; and 2.) the philosophy of pragmatism - which for James meant evaluating scientific theories according to their \"cash-value.\" In James's pragmatist view, a good theory is one that does good work in the minds of those who use it.\n\nJames saw \"habit,\" like Duhigg does, as a core aspect of human nature. Duhigg draws attention to success stories in habit replacement, from dental hygiene to aluminum manufacture. In keeping with the philosophical pulse of James the pragmatist, I give Duhigg's \"The Power of Habit\" a five-star rating for its eye-opening reports on useful research, chock full of real-world examples. Plus the book is written in a style that is vivid and inviting.",
    "A study by Duke University researchers in 2006 found that more than 40% of the actions people performed each day weren't actual decisions, but habits.\nIn the past decade, our understanding of the neurology and psychology of habits and the way patterns work in our lives, societies, and organizations has expanded in ways we couldn't have imagined 50 years ago. We know why habits emerge, how they change, and the science behind their mechanics. Duhigg applies these insights in three contexts – the individual, the organizational, and societal.\nHabit replacement or eradication is virtually impossible without an understanding of the three-step loop of habit formation. First there is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical, mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.\nWith time, this loop – cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward – becomes more and more automatic. When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making which is a good thing because without the loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutia of daily life.\nSimply understanding how habits work makes them easier to control.\nIn the early 1900’s the health of Americans teeth was in steep decline as the nation had become wealthier, and people started buying larger amounts of sugary, processed foods. When the government started drafting men for World War I, so many recruits had rotting teeth that officials declared dental hygiene a national security risk. At the time only 7% of Americans had a tube of toothpaste in their medicine chests. A decade later that number jumped to 65%.\nThe change was caused by advertising produced by Claude Hopkins. He had been approached by a friend who had discovered a new toothpaste, a minty, frothy concoction he called Pepsodent. The success story, as told by Hopkins, required educating the nation on the importance of toothbrushing and then to have them choose Pepsodent continuously. Hopkins projected the mucin plaque that forms on teeth as a “cloudy film” that obscures the whiteness of your teeth and the beauty of your smile. The cue was the feeling of film on one’s teeth, the routine was brushing, and the reward was a beautiful Pepsodent smile, just like Shirley Temple and Clark Gable. (More careful investigation identified the fresh sensation after brushing as the reward rather the promise of a beautiful smile.) It became one of the world’s best-selling consumer goods and remained so for more than 30 years.\nThe golden rule of habit change that emerges from a plethora of research is that if you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you need only insert a new routine. You cannot extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it. Duhigg describes how the golden rule has influenced the treatment for alcoholism, obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and hundreds of other destructive behaviours, and how an understanding the loop can help anyone change their own habits.\nOrganizations have been effectively transformed through the understanding of habits. Duhigg sites Alcoa and Starbucks as examples of how leaders identified keystone habits and built them into their organisations with profound impact on the bottom line.\nAlcoa, the giant American aluminium manufacturer after enjoying decades of success, was beginning to make misstep after misstep. There was some relief among shareholders when the Board announced the appointment of a former government bureaucrat named Paul O'Neill as CEO and scheduled an opportunity for investors to meet him. Investor relief turned to horror as O'Neill announced that he intended to make Alcoa the safest place to work in America – no mention of boosting profits, lowering costs, new “synergies,” “rightsizing,” “co-opetition” or other buzz words that are the standard in a new CEO’s speech. He even pointed out the safety exists in the hall in which they were gathered.\nMany thought he would kill the company and immediately sold their holdings, only to deeply regret it when within a year profits hit a record high. When O’Neill left the company its net income was five times larger than when he arrived.\nO'Neill had identified a keystone habit which he drove relentlessly through the organisation. He told staff, unions and managers that he was happy to negotiate with them about anything, but that there was one thing he would never negotiate with them and that was worker safety in Alcoa’s very dangerous environment. “If you want to argue with me about that, you are going to lose.” He demanded weekly reports on safety issues, participated in safety investigations, and fired very senior executive jeopardising a joint-venture safety violation.\nThe obsession with safety created an environment committed to excellence and discipline. The genius of choosing this keystone habit was that no one would raise objection, not staff, not unions and not management.\nWhen Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, returned to take control of his faltering 17,000 store enterprise, he put in place to keystone habit very similar to that of O'Neill. Among other changes, he placed great emphasis on the courteous manner in which baristas served every cup of coffee to every customer, every time. The training processes utilises the best insights into habit formation and focused on the development of self-discipline under the trying conditions of a quick service coffee shop.\n“We're in the people business serving coffee. The entire business model is based on fantastic customer service. Without that, we're toast.” The solution for Starbucks was to turn the self-discipline required to exhibit nothing but courteous service into an organisational habit. Their financial results are testimony to the efficacy of the approach.\nThe implications of this book are wide-ranging and powerful. Of the many books that have come out recently dealing with behavioural psychology and sociology, The Power of Habit is one of the most accessible and entertaining.\n\nReadability Light -+--- Serious\nInsights High -+--- Low\nPractical High -+--- Low\n\nIan Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy",
    "Before I begin my book review, for those who are planning to purchase this book, they must know what this book WILL NOT offer you (in case you’re looking for below points):\n1. This book will not help you inculcate habits or help you in forming new habits\n2. This book will not dramatically change your life (in case you were hoping so. If you wish to change your life dramatically, you’ll have to help your own self)\n3. This book will not help you get rid of your bad habits.\n\nNow that we’re clear with what this book doesn’t offer, let us look at what this book offers:\n1. The book will tell you how habits work and how are they formed (the scientific approach). So it does not directly help you in forming new habits or getting rid of bad ones, but you can try applying the scientific approach described in the book and see if it helps you or not.\n2. The book will help you understand the power of habits among individuals, organizations and societies through powerful and impactful examples\n3. The book will describe various instances and stories around products, instances, and individuals etc, to emphasize on the importance of habits and how we can use habits to our advantage.\nThe book helps you understand why habits are at the very core of anything you do, how you can change them (scientific approach), and what impact that will have on your business, life and society.\n\nThe book is primarily divided into 3 parts\nPart 1 – Habits of Individuals\nPart 2 – Habits of Successful Organisations\nPart 3 – Habits of Societies\n\nThe book is written by Pulitzer-prize winning author Charles Duhigg, and was first published in 2012. It is one of the bestseller in the ‘Self-help’ category. Duhigg wrote this book when he got fascinated by the intelligence of a US army major in Iraq, who controlled numerous riots by persuading the town’s mayor to keep food vendors away from gatherings. When people couldn’t satisfy their hunger with food, as they usually did (put of habit), they just left. Duhigg published this book after a lot of research, 8 years after this incident.\n\nNow that you know what led to creation of this book, let’s look at the book summary:\n\n1. Habits work in 3-step loops: cue, routine, reward. The cue is what triggers you to do the habit. The routine is the behavior you then automatically engage in. Lastly, you’ll receive a reward for completing the routine. Example: You get up every morning (Cue), make coffee (routine) and have a rich tasting coffee with a great aroma (reward).\n\n2. You can change your habits by substituting just one part of the loop, the routine. The trick to changing a habit then, is to switch the routine, and leave everything else intact.\n\n3. Your most important habit is willpower, and you can strengthen it over time in 3 ways. These three ways are:\n- Do something that requires a lot of discipline. - For example a tough wake-up regimen or strict diet will make you constantly practice delaying gratification and thus give you more willpower\n- Plan ahead for worst-case scenarios.\n- Preserve your autonomy - When you’re assigned tasks by someone else, which you must do, your willpower muscle tires much quicker.\n\n4. Keystone Habits are those habits which help you transform other habits. Figuring out these habits and working on them can create great transformation. Example – Getting up early can be a keystone habit that can have a positive impact on your other spheres of life such as having breakfast daily without skipping it, reaching work on time, having more time throughout the day for various tasks etc.\nThe author describes this with wonderful example of Alcoa’s transformation by Paul Neill.\n\n5. Every small habit is like a small win. And a series small wins will help you form a routine/habit. Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favors another small win. Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.\nThe author describes this with the story Michael Phelps, the world renowned swimmer.\n\n6. Transformation is always easier in groups, rather than alone or in isolation. Example – If you have a gym buddy, you’re more likely to hit the gym, than skip it.\n\n7. Good leaders seize crises to remake organizational habits. In fact, crises are such valuable opportunities that a wise leader often prolongs a sense of emergency on purpose. The author describes this with transformation of a subway station after a major fire broke out killing many people.\n\n8. People’s habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event. To encourage people to practice new behavior, it needs to take advantage of patterns that already exists within them. Author uses example of the hypermarket chain Target, and how it uses customer’s demographics and spending habits to extract key inferences that help them sell relevant products to these consumers.\n\n9. Social change and movement only happen with the existence of the weak link – the change as a whole within a group of people without a direct connection – and the strong link – the change of people around with close relationship (peer pressure). The author describes the movement in Montgomery against racial discrimination and how the movement gathered momentum.\n\n10. Habits emerge within the brain and often, we don’t have the ability to control them, but we’re conscious and aware of them. With that said, it’s still our responsibility to cultivate our own habits and take charge of our own life.\n\nThe book is filled with multiple stories and instances that reiterate how important habits are and how we can use them to our advantage. I hope this was helpful! Thanks.\n\nFavorite Quote from the book:\n“The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.” – Charles Duhigg",
    "Believe me or not, but everything i’m Writing here is true.\nI’m a 20 y/o pretty normal male, living in England\nAnd this book has completely changed my life.\nI was a regular smoker of both tobacco and cannabis, and the routine change taught in this book, and the methods of distraction taught in this book has helped me so much. I just want to say Thanks to Charles for making such an enjoyable book, which has taught me a lot about habits.\n10/10 would read again.\nCallum",
    "“Self-help books” are like chain restaurants. There are too many of them, most of them are rubbish, but you can’t deny that they are useful.\n\nHabit is a book that is extremely useful. We start off with some obvious but solid reminders of how what we perceive as excellence is habit. It’s not about “grit” as some other books would say.\n\nSimply setting a reminder to go to bed and putting your trainers next to your bed every night is a better way to get exercising than watching motivational videos on YouTube. Humans look for the way way out. Make things easy. Create a reward loop and you will develop a habit.\n\nAfter a solid start the book falters and diverges quickly. Stories become way too drawn out and - I would argue - not relevant to the reason most people buy this book. We get a long chapter on how supermarkets are monitoring our shopping habits via reward cards and can tell if your are pregnant from your food grocery list.\n\nWe have a chapter that massively drags on how a cassino kept a gambler coming back but stimulating her habit and reminding her of the rewards (debt in this case).\n\nLike many self help books, you want to throw it out the window at times. But it’s got a solid thesis. I now keep my trainers next to my bed and have created a habit I never thought feasible. Thus the book is worth it’s weight of gold. It’s just got a core of lead to go along with it.",
    "Habit is a choice that we deliberately make at some point and then stop thinking about it, but continue doing, often every day. Author in this book examines why some people and organizations struggle to change while others seem to rediscover themselves by building a compelling argument around the power of habits.\n\nThis book is divided into three parts. Each part explains a different aspect of why habits exist and how they function.\n\nThe examples used in this book are so powerful and relevant that reader will feel a lot of wow moments. This is one of the books which we need to read again and again.",
    "Everyone knows that it’s a really good book by Charles Duhigg, no doubt in that. But this sellers is giving a duplicate version of the book which is having very rough paper quality and poor print. It’s really a shame that such seller exists on amazon which sells product at 4-5 times costlier than offline.\nYou can easily purchase such low quality printed book at 50-100rs from people selling outside metro station in delhi or at traffic lights in any city or from any local bookstore.\nAlso you can NOT RETURN THE BOOK ONCE PURCHASED.\nIt’s better to buy the ebook or kindle book than investing 400-500 on such a cheap quality book.\nPurchased at 456 rs.\nSeller- uReadStore"

    "Ego is never neutral. If it is too small, you give away the farm. If it is too large, you eventually lose the farm. This superb book by Ryan Holiday, focuses on the more common affliction of the talented, ambitious and confident – an ego too large.\n\nAs the book sets out to prove, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego. Holiday saw this unfold in slow motion with the demise of Dov Charney, founder and chairman of the huge, but failing American Apparel. He saw this unfold in his own ostensibly spectacular career, and in the careers of ancient historical personalities, as well as the contemporary ones that illustrate this sobering book.\n\nThe ego he is referring to is the unhealthy belief in our own importance, our arrogance, and our self-centred ambition. It is that petulant child in every person, who chooses getting his or her way over anything, or anyone else. Holiday believes that ego is “at the root of almost every conceivable problem and obstacle, from why we can’t win to why we need to win all the time and at the expense of others.”\n\nThis problem is now more acute than ever. The culture of the developed world fans the flames of ego. It has never been easier to boast to millions through free social media. Motivational speakers mislead by telling us to think big, live big, be memorable and “dare greatly”, because that is what this great company founder, or that championship team, supposedly did.\n\nThroughout the rest of your life, if you fit into the category of the talented, ambitious and confident, you will be at one of three phases: aspiration, success, or failure. In each phase you will need to do battle with your ego, and the mistakes it can cause.\n\nHoliday’s book leads the reader though each of the phases. The first is when we aspire - and whatever one aspires to, ego is the enemy. A common ego ploy is a belief in oneself that is not dependent on actual achievement, but on intense self-absorption, and endless self-promotion.\n\n“Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It’s more ‘Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am.’ It’s rarely the truth: ‘I’m scared. I’m struggling. I don’t know,” Holiday explains.\n\nMost valuable projects we chase are painfully difficult: launching a new start-up, or mastering a new skill. Talking, on the other hand, is always easy. While research does show that goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse the visualization and the talk, with actual progress. The more difficult the task and the more uncertain the outcome, the more talk costs. Great work is a struggle. It’s draining, demoralizing, and frightening. “The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other,” Holiday claims.\n\n‘Facts are better than dreams,’ Winston Churchill asserted. Appearances deceive. Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same, and impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive.\n\nThe second phase kicks in when you are successful. Here the enemy of sustained success takes a different form, and requires a different response.\n\nThe theory of ‘disruption’ posits that at some point every industry will be disrupted by some trend or innovation that the incumbents will be incapable of responding to. The question then is why can’t the businesses change and adapt?\n\nHoliday believes that this mimics why successful people fail – they have lost the ability to learn. Learning requires true humility and this can be seen from how people observe and listen. The humble don’t assume they know. As such, the remedy for avoiding the ‘I know it all’ ego trap in phase two, is straightforward but initially uncomfortable: “Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you’re the least knowledgeable person,” he recommends. This aids the development of one ego antidote – humility.\n\nEgo fragments, closes options, and mesmerizes. It clouds the mind precisely when it needs to be clear, and a second potent solution for this is sobriety. This acts as both a counterbalance, and as a prevention method.\n\nThe German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, both during her rise and especially during her time in power, has consistently maintained her equilibrium and clear-headedness, regardless of the immediate stressors or stimuli. When Russian president Vladimir Putin once attempted to intimidate Merkel by letting his large hunting dog barge into a meeting (Merkel is not a dog lover), she didn’t flinch and later joked about it. As a result, Putin was the one who looked foolish and insecure.\n\nA German writer observed in a tribute on her 50th birthday that unpretentiousness is Merkel’s main weapon. The successful, who like Merkel, maintain their equilibrium and clear-headedness, have normal private lives with their spouses. They lack pretence, they wear normal clothes, and for the most part are people you’ve never heard of, which is the way they want it.\nThe third phase, failure, is an inevitable stop on the journey to success. “There is hardly the space to list all the successful people who have hit rock bottom,” Holiday explains. Ego not only leaves us unprepared for failure, but often contributes to it in the first place.\nHumble and strong people, who maintain their equilibrium and clear-headedness, don’t have the same trouble with failure that egotists do.\n\nWhat matters in the failure phase is that we can respond to what life throws at us. When we fail, many questions arise: how do I make sense of this? How do I move onward and upward? Is this the bottom, or is there more to come? How did I let this happen? How can it never happen again?\n\nThe experience of failure almost always comes from some outside force or person, and it often involves things we already knew about ourselves, but were too scared to admit. However, from the ruin, the opportunity for great progress and improvement can emerge.\n\n“When we lose, we have a choice: Are we going to make this a lose-lose situation for ourselves and everyone involved? Or will it be a lose… and then win?” Holiday asks.\n\nPerfecting oneself is what leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around. To be a success, requires that we are humble in our aspirations, gracious in our success, and resilient in our failures. Studies of truly successful individuals show them to be grounded, circumspect, and unflinchingly real. No truly successful person is delusional, self-absorbed, or disconnected.\n\n“When we remove ego, we’re left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility, yes—but rock-hard humility and confidence,” Holiday concludes.\n\nThis book should be read, and then re-read intermittently.\n\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High --+--Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of Strategy that Works. .",
    "If ego is nothing more than a Freudian concept to you, then you may not have any idea how it’s holding you back right now. But don’t think that author Ryan Holiday aims to bore us with the same stale pop-psychology tropes that most books on the Self-Help shelf use to fill out their pages. What the author has provided us is actually a great work of modern practical philosophy.\n\nThose familiar with Holiday’s last book, “The Obstacle is the Way,” will know exactly what practical philosophy means. Eschewing the commonly held view that philosophy is the province of academics in classrooms bloviating about abstract concepts, Holiday follows the Stoic tradition that puts philosophy firmly in the realm of everyday life. It’s about learning to deal with destructive emotions, unpredictable circumstances, self-interested people, and yes, ego, without succumbing to them. It’s philosophy as a way of achieving a better life.\n\nIn “Ego is the Enemy,” Holiday moves beyond the clinical definitions of ego and places the concept firmly in the realm of the practical. To be sure, the clinical and the practical in this case have some common ground. Modern psychologists define the ego as a critical part of identity construction, and further, an egotist as someone excessively focused on himself. Holiday defines ego along those lines: “an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition…It’s when the notion of ourselves and the world grows so inflated that it begins to distort the reality that surrounds us.”\n\nThe idea that becoming untethered from reality is the primary symptom of an ego out of control is the thread that unites all three sections of this book. Holiday expands this idea throughout the three sections that form a continuum - Aspire, Success, and Failure - to show how this form of ego plagues everyone from the ambitious and striving, to the wildly successful and those who have been crushed by personal and professional defeat. In our own lives, we are always somewhere on that circle of aspiration, success and failure.\n\nTo this end, Holiday goes right to the sources of practical wisdom: the primary sources of great practical wisdom – Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Aristotle, and Martial to name a few - and the biographies of those who apply that wisdom to great effect or ignore it at their own peril.\n\nThis is where Holiday’s other key influence, strategist and author Robert Greene, becomes apparent. Like Greene, all of Holiday’s chapters start out with a short, pithy title sets the direction of the advice contained within the chapter. From there, Holiday mines the stories of great men and women who have either applied the advice laid out in the chapter title or ignored it and shows us the consequences of both.\n\nFor example, in the chapter titled, “Restrain Yourself” in the Aspire section of the book, Holiday launches right into the story of Jackie Robinson. As the first black player in the newly integrated MLB, Robinson faced discrimination and outright abuse at the hands of everyone from his own teammates and opponents, to hotel managers and restaurant owners and, of course, the press. At any point, Robinson could have lashed out, fighting back to defend his dignity against the injustices he faced.\n\nBut Robinson knew that if he fought back even once, it would end his MLB career and set the prospect of full integration of the league back for a generation. As Holiday writes, “Jackie’s path called for him to put aside both his ego and in some respects his basic sense of fairness and rights as a human being.”\n\nNow, it’s likely that few of us will face the kind of treatment Robinson did, but the lesson here is that when we have ambitions and goals, we’re likely to run into the kind of people that Robinson did. The kind who react to your striving with cold indifference. The kind who aim to weaken your will with taunts and jeers. The kind who will go out of their way to sabotage you and undo all your efforts.\n\nHoliday concludes here that ego tells us to snap back at these people and demand the respect we think we deserve. But that won’t earn it from anyone. We must ignore this impulse, no matter how badly we’re treated, and continue to work on our craft and ourselves. We must forget what we think the world owes us and focus on building our base, developing our skills and continuing to learn.\n\nThe rest of the chapters follow this same model, and plumb the depths of modern and ancient history to show us how those who put their egos aside achieve great things. Think of New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick spending years doing unpaid grunt work and film study before finally getting a chance to put his knowledge into practice. Think of the great conqueror Genghis Khan seeking greater knowledge and expertise from those he defeated, rather than forcing them into silent subservience.\n\nYet, others turn themselves into cautionary tales. Howard Hughes was a mechanical genius who inherited a successful family business, and then squandered all of it through a lack of focus, entitlement and paranoia. John DeLorean had a great vision for an automobile company, but never built the solid foundation of leadership skills he would need to run a successful company.\n\nHoliday gives us a healthy dose of both kinds of stories, and that’s what makes the advice in this book stick with us. Ultimately, practical philosophy is meant to be used in our daily lives, away from the safety of our reading chair. Holiday’s aphoristic style of advice, bolstered by memorable stories is what gives us the tools we need to remember this wisdom when our egos start to take control of us.\n\nHoliday positions the three states of our lives – Aspire, Success and Failure – as being a never ending continuum. We must put our egos aside as we aspire to our goals, aside when we achieve them, and aside again when we flame out and have to start over. At each stage, ego threatens to knock us off the continuum altogether and lock us into an unproductive state of stasis.\n\nTaming your ego is never easy, but it is essential when we are confronted by failure or bolstered by success, as we all will be in our lives. Ego can easily let both conditions become debilitating: With success, we think we can stop being humble and working hard. In failure, we can become paralyzed, blaming others for our rotten luck and ignoring the fact that it’s on us to right the ship.\n\nEgo is always encroaching on us, even after we think we’ve beaten it back. As Daniele Bolelli puts it, a floor doesn’t stay clean because you’ve swept it once; you must sweep again and again. With this short, accessible book, Holiday gives us the tools we need to do just that.",
    "What Mr. Holiday is telling us is that the motive of this \"ego\" is self-grandeur (destructive) at any cost, irrational, emotional, beyond reason, unexamined, preservation of a fictional \"ideal\" self. This ego is your enemy. When do you stop examining, working, and reflecting...never.\nI have one minor criticism; Mr. Holiday says he is a student of history and yet some of his quotes and examples from history are a bit of a stretch. His books are a great devotional tool for self-reflection and meditation. We could all enjoy a cup of tea and a quick read to carry us through the day.",
    "Ryan Holiday is a phenomenal mind. He breaks difficult concepts down into digestible nuggets of wisdom. He uses real life examples both OLD and NEW, to cement his points. To add, he crosses over various industries from sports to entertainment to politics- that help get the major points across. It is one of the most fascinating history lessons I’ve ever been apart of. Throughout the whole book, he is extremely genuine and vulnerable, even using some\nof his own personal examples to highlight some\nhis points. Ryan Holiday & Ego is the enemy he inspired me to be more than what my ego would like me to be- but to be a person of love, virtue, balance, and wisdom- that is where true success is. I am 22 & attend UCF, I truly do wonder why reads like these aren’t mandatory. If you are breathing air, I recommend you getting this book. Huge s/o to the selfless, detailed work of Ryan Holiday- thankyou!",
    "Reading Holiday's book on ego may challenge you, it may make you wince with revulsion and think \"Surely, I'm not like that, am I?\" but odds are, ego is holding you back.\n\nIt makes you feel resentful and angry, like your boss isn't recognising your greatness. That eats you up inside and only makes you upset and stressed all the time.\n\nInstead, Holiday teaches you the lesson, through many stories and examples, that you'll actually feel better and perform better by recognising your ego, catching when it tries to rear its ugly head, and focusing on what you can do for others instead.\n\nThis book has had an immeasurably positive impact on my life. I work harder and generally feel much happier in everyday life. Thank you Ryan.",
    "This book changed my life.\n\nI first read this 4 years ago following my brother's strong recommendation. As a result, I have aimed to be more 'balanced'- a concept I am still trying to understand- which has meant at work keeping more calm under the body when dealing with stressful situations and being more grateful for every day things.\n\nBut it also has made me less driven- which upon reflection today- I am not sure is particularly good.\n\nThere is a case for passion (though the book states passion is retarded). Passion helps wake me up in the morning- see that there are struggles ahead- but part of this is to drive myself really hard- and with this persistence sometimes my best solutions come (for example when writing essays- I often discard idea after idea until one is reached not through being balanced but by real struggle). Perhaps one of the best things in life is to solve a problem that you initially thought was difficult- and that is through really applying yourself and believing you can do this (whether you can or not). Sometimes it really does help to build one's confidence by telling yourself- by really going for whatever activity (being able to drive) with raw power and doing whatever you can- then you are able to master the problem. You can do this!\n\nAlso- perhaps to think in each moment in life whether one is doing the most balanced thing- is paralyzing. Rather than doing the thing you love, letting this take you wherever, and end up in a new spontaneous place? This level of balance sounds soul sucking. And I have felt this.\n\nMy first impression of Ego is the enemy is that the book is near flawless. But over time, as well as seeing the most recent film of Little Women- has really shifted this. in Little Women, the main character is extremely passionate about writing- and I think it is that which is part of the beauty of the character- and in addition that passion I feel must have contributed to her great plays.\n\nWhat I think now is one rather has enthusiasm than none at all. Perhaps I might choose passion over balance- but the best formula may be that driving passion occasionally being tempered by other values.\n\nLooking forward to your comments",
    "First off, a real stoic would never tattoo anything on his forearms.\n\nSecond, it goes on and on about some peripheral characters from American history without mentioning many much more relevant people who tackled and defeated the ego throughout history.\n\nThird, nicely wrapped up between the lines, still gives an impression that success is to \"make it big\" a.k.a. the American dream. It just needs to be done tactically and with patience, that is pretty much the main advice.\n\nFourth, politics again. I was wondering when I would read something against the Russian President Vladimir Putin. It came on page 146. Of course!\n\nFinal: anyone serious about stoicism and philosophy in general will find this book rather silly. I regret the paper it was printed on and am currently using the book to level a table in the garage. Fits perfectly.",
    "I have to say that I expected something different from this hyped book. I was expecting a practical guide on how to work on reducing the influence of ego in my daily life and my decisions. Instead, I found it was more of a collection of anecdotes from history about failed egomaniacs and successful quiet leaders.\n\nFor a non-fiction book, it's surprisingly unpractical and non-scientific. This would be my biggest criticism.\n\nYet I would recommend it to those who want to be inspired to keep doing great work and to hang in there, even though gratification and rewards still might be miles away. For me, it's less of a book I need to read front to back to grasp the concepts, but more of a book I can pick up whenever I need a small hit of inspiration.",
    "I was looking for organised, informative advise on how to recognise and disarm egotistical beliefs and behaviours. Reading this was a bit like sitting next to smart guy in a bar, who had a lot to say but also had a lot to drink. I found the tone aggressive and uncomfortably personalised - ironic when he touts stoicism as the best route. Seemed like he assumed his audience were men (mostly) - in fact, it seemed as if he was shouting at himself in a mirror throughout most of the book. I wish him all the best and I hope he finds peace."

    "Written for a wider audience than the normal book on economics, this is a good and useful exploration of the role interest plays, or should play, in modern life. Those in business, students, investors, bankers, politicians, and anyone else trying to make an honest dime will benefit from reading this book.\n\nThe author, Mr. Chancellor, is no fan of the actions of Central Bankers and politicians who are prone to keep interest rates near zero. The value of keeping market place decisions honest (a role in large part supplied by the commercial availability of reasonable interest rates) is underscored by multiple harrowing examples of bubbles occurring when economic forces are artificially channeled into stupid investments.\n\nI'm not sure that I am convinced by all Mr. Chancellor's arguments and thinking, but I agree with him that John Locke's comment about good intentions (p. 314) applies to his efforts here.",
    "This book is a gift for my husband, a microeconomist. The book is as described. EArrived packaged beautifully and on time. Great book and great fulfillment.",
    "Longtime financial commentator Edward Chancellor has written a sweeping socio-economic history of interest rates going back to the ancient Sumerian civilization of over 4000 years ago and the Code of Hammurabi up to the present. Chancellor correctly notes that interest rates represent the “universal price of time” that links the present to the future and is essential in valuing any asset.\n\nHis concern is that when politicians and central bankers underprice the cost of money all kinds of bad things happen. Those bad things would include asset bubbles, commodity price inflation, income inequality, uneconomic investment, the monopolization of the economy and food riots leading to political destabilization. But what is the correct price? Chancellor relies on the work of Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, Irving Fisher, Friedrich Hayek, and Knut Wicksell. He leaves out the work of my late and great economics professor Jack Hirshleifer with his “Investment, Interest and Capital.”\n\nSimply put on a micro foundation basis the interest rate is determined by society’s rate of time preference and its ability to increase output overtime. Thus, from the point of view of output growth the real interest rate should equate to the real growth in GDP. However, when money, credit and central banking are introduced you dramatically increase the likelihood of overshooting and undershooting the neutral rate of interest.\n\nChancellor criticizes central bankers for their seeking economic stability via inflation targeting. Low inflation in product markets usually makes sense, but sometimes it masks inflation is asset markets giving rise to bubbles. It here where Chancellor brings in Hyman Minsky’s work on stability leading to instability. Thus, it was the Great Moderation of 1982-2007 that led to the crash of 2008.\n\nHe is especially critical of Fed chairs, Bernanke, Yellen, and Powell for them violating Bagehot’s rules for acting in a crisis and for all of them keeping interest rates way to low for way to long which gave rise to the maladies listed above. With respect to Walter Bagehot, in a banking crisis the central bank should lend aggressively on good collateral at a penalty rate. To be sure our central bankers lent aggressively, but not all on good collateral and certainly not at a penalty rate which opened the gates to a populist rebellion against the bankers.\n\nBy keeping interest rates too low for too long, the Fed totally distorted the relationship between the present and the future which made hitherto unprofitable investments lucrative. Thus, instead of investing in new assets businesses and individuals bid up the price of existing assets to the detriment of long run productivity. And remember who owns existing assets, the already wealthy.\n\nWhat Chancellor gets wrong is that he focuses too much on the policy rate. The relevant interest rate is the long-term rate which is tied to the long-term growth in the economy and the long-term rate via the term premium is usually higher than the policy rate. Further, necessary short-term reductions in the policy rate to manage a crisis and/or a recession should not affect long term rates all that much. However, when central banks promise to keep rates low forever, the long-term rate will converge on the short-term rate. Thus, the error of the Fed was not to lower the rates in a crisis but keeping them low well past the crisis.\n\nEdward Chancellor has written an important book that reflects Austrian economics over Keynesian economics, but I suspect it will gain popularity overtime as the credibility of our central bankers continues to erode.",
    "There are some interesting assertions in the book that would lend greater enjoyment by viewing the source. Unfortunately, the 451 pages are all text — so not only no links, but also no way to find them by scrolling to the end pages.",
    "The book has enlightening history on the various explanations of interest - is it the price of money, risk, relative power, time? The 2nd part of the book takes a close look at the impact of ultra-low interest rates. They are supposed to stimulate growth, but do they? You might not agree with all the arguments but I found it really worthwhile to read and consider them.",
    "I genuinely love the book.",
    "The Price of Time, in the best case, is a misnomer. The book is not a story of interest rates despite the occasional attempts to weave them into the narrative. Its first part provides summaries of a few most celebrated historic bubbles, followed by a long, unstructured diatribe on the state of current markets, economic structures, and policy frameworks.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with these topics. The author's attempts fall short because of how the content appears manipulated, like the title of the book, to emphasize his discomfort with the way things are. The author is right in pointing out numerous current ills from the extreme and rising inequality to market valuations, corporate abuses and policy adventurism, real-life reflexivities of financial events and externalities including climate damage, etc.\n\nThe author is not alone in listing these issues. These topics are covered continuously by a rising horde in a far more effective manner almost daily in books and journals. This book has little primary research. Worse, its reliance on the points made by others is so inconsistent that the arguments often lose credibility.\n\nFor instance, the author would lament the lack of creative destruction in one paragraph but have long sections on individual companies that go bust. He would appear to favor the Austrian school of thought and Hayek, but still, have digs at Greenspan's connections with Ayn Rand or the regulatory failures in controlling the powers of today's giants in some other sections.\n\nThe inconsistencies are worse when the author discusses two sides of any interest rate level. The book would criticize how low rates hurt the pensioners relying on interest income, but mind savers benefiting from rising wealth levels of financial instruments. The author never realizes how much the two groups overlap and why retirees worldwide have not gone up in arms against low-interest rates decades later. Take another argument in the same vein: the author would criticize low-interest rates for luring students and consumers of all types to borrow but would still want funding available to these groups all the time for the betterment of the masses.\n\nOnce again, the conclusions are not wrong. The problem is the ad hocism in the arguments used to support them. It is ok to use quotes from both Marx and Smith or Keynes and Mises to point out any unsustainability, but when it happens too often, it all begins to jangle. For example, the author does not like central banks because of their lack of policy framework. He seems to believe in the Austrian worldview that argues against fiat money, seen as the leading cause of the boom-bust cycle in the prices of financial assets and possibly also real-life goods/services. The book does not like cryptocurrencies, though - and for all the right reasons. Somehow, the author sees a solution in government-issued digital currencies...go figure!\n\nThe damage because of the lack of consistent argument framework is most when the author has to turn prescriptive. Mercifully, the book has little to offer on alternatives, although there is a section full of platitudes at the end.\n\nA final word: History provides hardly any examples of economic successes without attendant financial/property market boom-busts, a point that goes unacknowledged. Every bubble-bust-prone system has not progressed consistently over the long term, but it is difficult to think of any society that has grown well over decades without boom-bust cycles. Unfortunately, perhaps.",
    "The Price of Time is a recently published book by Edward Chancellor. Its subtitle is “The Real Story of Interest” which makes it very topical as bank interest rates are being raised in both the USA and UK in an attempt to damp down inflation. After an era when interest rates have been at their lowest levels in the last 5,000 years, and have even gone negative in some countries, a historic review of the impact of interest rates through booms and busts is certainly worth reading. But this is a difficult book in some ways.\n\nIt's too long at 400 pages for one thing for all but the most avid reader of economic history. Why do publishers (in this case Allen Lane part of Penguin) insist on their authors padding out their manuscripts to such length? This book would have been much better at 200 pages than 400. It attempts to cover too much ground and in too much detail while not getting the key messages across.\n\nIt covers some ancient history but really gets going in a good explanation of how Scotsman John Law rescued the French economy in the 1700s by lowering interest rates and issuing paper money – similar to the modern Quantitative Easing. But thereafter that economic experiment ended in tears. The book covers the economic booms and busts in the Victorian era forward through the depression in the 1930s to the banking crisis in 2008, and the reaction of Governments.\n\nThe book attempts to answer the question of whether there is a natural rate of interest, i.e. one that would apply if the Government did not intervene as the have persistently done throughout history – from the imposition of usury laws, through debt forgiveness to modern central bank base rates.\n\nWhy is interest paid? Because an investor holding cash needs some return for the uncertainty of being repaid when money is lent. If the risk is higher then the interest paid has to be higher to attract lenders. In times of economic uncertainty such as wars, interest rates are raised.\n\nHistorically when there was a surplus of cash in the economy, interest rates would fall as there might be more lenders than borrowers. High interest rates are likely to reduce economic activity as borrowers are put off from investing in new developments such as buildings or machinery. Low interest rates should encourage economic activity and the circulation of money as opposed to the hoarding of assets.\nGovernments have taken a stance in recent years that lowering interest rates must be good to maintain a healthy economy but the result has been asset inflation. From stock market booms to house price inflation, if you can borrow money at very low rates it encourages speculation and the borrowing of money to buy assets.\n\nLenders also need a return to cover the future value of the money lent. If inflation is high, then interest will be high. Recently the Bank of England has had an inflation target of 2% while interest rates have been less for many borrowers. That made little sense. Inflation has now got out of hand but real interest rates are still effectively negative. That is essentially irrational.\n\nThe book covers the history of Government and central bank interventions in interest rates and the economy, often with unintended consequences. In that regard, it is a good education on what should or should not be done. One message is clear – artificially low interest rates are as bad for the economy as high interest rates.\n\nThe book is very well researched with numerous apposite quotations. I would recommend it to anyone interested in economic history and the trends that have made the modern world. But it could do with being shorter and having a more defined structure.",
    "This book is both a fascinating history and, in its later stages, a piercing critique of recent monetary policy trends. Chancellor does a a marvellous job of killing a few sacred cows and upending some key points of widespread economic consensus. Recent media coverage contrasting this book with Ben Bernanke’s new book has completely failed to engage substantively with Chancellor’s material. There is much more here than the FT and Economist make out. Should be required reading for economics undergrads and postgrads.",
    "Someone needed to write this book and Edward Chancellor has done an outstanding job."

    "I must read if you want to know how to win in life!",
    "This book isn’t for you if you don’t take accountability in your life. He’s going to say a lot of stuff you don’t like but need to hear. Most people complain about this book because they’re so used to blaming others and not putting themselves on that same pedestal. Absolutely love this book! Changed my look on life and self confidence ❤️",
    "No holds barred recipe for success, mostly shown through example. Although it is geared towards the top 1% competitiv and those who want to get there, there are many takeaways for everyone who wants to achieve anything.",
    "Great read",
    "Confess that I only got a few pages into this, but couldn't really take any more. Basically people are either coolers, closers or cleaners and you get lots of examples of the behaviours that characterise these personality types. Gems like \"A cooler is liked, a closer is respected, a cleaner is feared then respected for doing exactly what everybody feared he'd do.\"\nI'm not sure if the author taught this mindset to Kobe Bryant, developed this theory from observations of top athletes or just needed three convenient ways of saying \"good, better, winner\".\nTeenage-me would have spooned this stuff up, but as a grown up I find it hard to buy into all these psychological insights that seem to built on barstool anecdotes.\nPlus the author is just too much: \"Like my friend and client Charles Barkley... threw a guy through a plate glass window... told the judge \"I wish I'd taken him to the third floor and thrown him.\" Oh behave!",
    "It sounds like a great concept, and the author clearly has credentials, but really this book is of absolutely zero use. Well, unless you want to just read about a series of anecdotes about basketball players (about whom I know nothing about, but that shouldn't really be a problem).\nThere's nothing about how to actually gain the Cleaner mindset. At times he skates close to giving some useful tips, but then just name drops and moves on.\nAnd ultimately I couldn't take the Closer, Cooler, Cleaner concept seriously. I mean really? Are those the best names he could come up with or just the first ones that popped into his head?",
    "Disappointed with this as showed so much promise from an author who has worked with the greats of basketball.\nThere were a few key takeaway points for the real world, but overall this book was just self promoting the author & was directed at other basketball stars that might want to use him.",
    "This is a great book about peak performance. Tim Grover has built his career working with some of the top athletes in the world and making them even greater. He divides athletes into three categories:\n1. The Cooler\n2.The Closer\n3. The Cleaner\n\nCOOLER\nA person that you give a job to, and you will get the desired result. You will not get anything above that or extraordinary. The desired result will be satisfactory, and in the borders of what you asked for. You are not going to get anything exceptional.\n\nCLOSER\nCloser is a level above cooler. Closers are people that you can give a task to do and they will deliver great results back . They will deliver it the majority of the time, as long as not too many variables are thrown at them.\n\nCLEANER\nThis is a whole new level, a “ I do not think” person. They are so well prepared, they do not think and just do. They spend hours and hours of time (years actually) getting prepared, that no matter what is thrown at them they are going to deliver that end result at all times, over and over and over again. They will be exceptional at it. Their instincts are so dead-on, that no matter what variable, what problem is thrown at them, they can adjust on the fly and have the ability to get themselves in the “zone”.\n\nTim Grover talks about a few of the athletes he has worked with, from the late Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. Reading this book made me also think of soccer super star, Cristiano Ronaldo and how he is a cleaner too. These lessons from sport can be applied in business too. This is one of the best quotes I got from the book: \"A great leader knows the best way to get people to raise their performance is to put them where they can truly excel, not just where you want them to excel. Cleaners don't block others from reaching the top with them, if they're capable and ready.\"\n\nOverall a great read, especially if you are one of those people wanting to keep doing better and better.",
    "Q. What you will learn after reading this book?\n1. Mentality of great basketball players\n2. Their daily rituals\n3. Their mental strength through tough times\n4. How you can toughen your mind to become great.\n\nQ. Best thing about the book?\nThe blunt style of author. Tim uses straight forward approach. No bull_hit no indirect message. Just pure simple easy ways to become great.\n\nQ. Any criticism about the book?\nIf you are a self help reader then you won't find it that much helpful. Author is giving general advice by relating it with basketball players.\n\nGood read though"

    "Good quality, clean, like new book",
    "There is some good stuff in here.\n\nI like Knaflic’s focus on intentionality. For her, the defaults are something that should be avoided, or at least justified.\n\nI like how she looks at the presentation of graphic information as a story arc. There is one thing that you want to focus on to create actionable decisions. This is best, as she describes, if you are presenting. There are limitations if you have a static document that has information for multiple stakeholders.\n\nThe book is accessibly written with a clean font and plenty of examples.\n\nHowever, I do have to push back a bit. She follows Tufte in trying to eliminate data ink. Part of the intentionality is that you have less and less information on the page and every thing you includes helps tell your story. For me though that leads to a sameness. You want your audience to not have to think so hard. You want to make sure they don’t have their eyes glaze over. But that means that everything is very simple with a muted palette. The author notes that some of these are just her preference, but the mode of thinking has become influential. Part of me wants my audience to do some work in understanding the text I put in front of them. It means a level of engagement that I worry a too-simple graph leaves out.",
    "Essential, mandatory, elemental, critical, indispensable.",
    "I'm new to project leadership so I've been trying to read at least one book about managing, data, and design every month to get fresh ideas about how to do my work and where to take my career (hence my new Goodreads shelf, tech-boss-babe-reading-list). STORYTELLING WITH DATA went on sale recently for $4.99 and I decided to snap it up since graphs and charts aren't exactly my strongest point as someone who tends to be more verbal and less mathematically inclined.\n\nSome of the complaints for this book are that it teaches the basics. That might be disappointing for people who take to this sort of thing easily or have been doing it for years, but for newbies like me, it's really great. I like how the author included \"before\" and \"after\" examples, as well as examples of what \"good\" and \"bad\" displays of data look like.\n\nMy one complaint is that she doesn't really talk about tools. She says it's to make the stuff he talks about more relevant to everyone, by keeping things simple, and she does link to templates and other sources that give more in-depth how-tos with specific software, but I guess I was kind of hoping for a \"Graphing on Excel for Dummies\" checklist, so I will admit to being a little disappointed.\n\nOverall, though, this has some really great lists of what to do and what not to do and it will help people who do not think abstractly or mathematically tell \"stories\" with data in a way that makes sense.\n\n3.5 to 4 out of 5 stars",
    "One of the best story telling books I’ve bought so far. The examples included are practical and easy to understand. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who’s looking to improve their story telling skills or data visualization skills",
    "I find this book very useful and have stuck with reading through it (just finished chapter 5, so I'm more than halfway through) even though the binding sucks, and the book seems to be falling apart. Although none of the pages have fallen out, it's no fun to read a book with a broken spine.",
    "Don’t be fooled by the title. It’s not about visualising business information and modelling it’s about visualising KPIs. I’m sure it’s a fine book. Just not what I wanted.... it’s bar and line charts not how to tell a story using the core data. My fault. Didn’t do my homework!",
    "I was recommended this book, but unfortunately, it doesn't live up to expectations. This will be helpful for you if you have no common sense and have never met a good graph before. If you're looking to improve from creating basic graphs, this won't help you. The overviews of the different graph types were basic, I would argue many of the author's examples of a 'good graph' could still be improved, she tries to argue pie charts are rubbish through showing an awful 3D pie chart, then explaining 3D in itself is rubbish (duh!). Then also tries to argue for ethics in data on the principle that you shouldn't mislead because you'll be figured out by a smart audience member (not because it's principally wrong). Big book with big text, not much substance and will be reselling. Would highly recommend 'Better Data Visualizations' by Jonathan Schwabish instead.",
    "If your job is to talk with people about numbers (any numbers: profit and loss, salary, election results, number of stars in the universe) then this book is for you. If you have created a chart to explain something, but not sure if people will understand what you're trying to tell them then this book is for you. If you work with Excel, Power BI or any other tool to visualize data, don't stop on readying books about ETL and Power Query, Excel formulas, data modeling and DAX. ETL, data modeling, formulas/calculations - all this steps you're doing for one reason - to make it possible and easy for you or other people to get useful insights from the data. To make data easy to understand, to extract useful insight you need to visualize the data. To visualize the data doesn't mean to drag&drop data fields onto a chart. It means to make meaningful visual representation of the data. And you need to read good books about data visualization to understand the concepts. And this is the first book to read. Easy to read book based on real life examples. This books will help you understand why colorful visualization is not the same as insightful visualization, why you need to think carefully about each line, each caption, each color on your data visualization. After reading this book you'll be crying looking at the thousands of colorful pie charts (with tens of similar size sectors colored using all possible colors) posted in the internet by people who know how to create a chart using a software, but don't understand (yet) what is the purpose of this data transformation into a visual object. Read the book, and make the world of data visualization better. If you need more practice, read another book of the same author - \"Storytelling with Data: Let's Practice!\". Cole is a great teacher of the science (and art) called data visualization.",
    "It is difficult (if not impossible) to manage what cannot be measured. Yes, there are “intangibles” (e.g. empathy) that have unique value and importance. Quantifying the so-called “soft skills” (e.g. listening) also poses challenges. However, the fact remains that data visualization can enrich and extend a narrative’s impact, especially when the objective is persuasion or resolution rather than entertainment.\n\nWhat Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic provides in this volume is an abundance of information, insights, and counsel that can help almost anyone to master the skills needed, in Knaflic's words, “to visualize data and tell stories with it” in order to turn the data “into information that can be used to drive better decision making.”\n\nThese are among the several dozen passages of greatest interest and value to me, also listed to suggest the scope of Knaflic’s coverage:\n\no Thinking like a designer (Pages 15-16 and 127-150)\no Importance of context (19-33)\no Selecting visuals that will be effective (35-69)\no Graphs (43-49)\no Bar charts (50-59, 156-158, 161-162, and 236-237)\no Visuals to avoid (61-68)\no Voiding clutter (71-98)\no Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception (74-81)\no Lack of visual order (81-86)\no Focusing on an audience’s attention (99-126)\no Preattentive attributes (102-116)\no Affordances (128-138)\no Hierarchy of Information (135-138)\no Accessibility (138-145)\no Storytelling (165-185)\no Storytelling with data process (187-205 and 242-255)\no Case Study 2: Leveraging animation in the visuals you present (210-218)\no Case Study 4: Strategies for avoiding the spaghetti graph (227-234)\n\nI agree with Knaflic: “There is a story in your data. But your tools don’t know what that story is. That’s where it takes you — the analyst or commentator of the information — to bring that stay visually and contextually to life. That process is the focus of this book.”\n\nThese are the specific learning objectives on which she focuses, each preceded by “How to….”\n\no Understand the context in which the story is presented\no Select an appropriate visual display of the data\no Eliminate clutter\no Focus attention where it is most needed\no Think like a designer\no Tell the story (setting. characters, plot, conflicts, resolution, etc.)\n\nPresumably Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic agrees with me that the most effective storytellers are aware of an unspoken question that every member of the given audience has in mind: “Why should I care?” or perhaps “What’s in it for me?” The story format will help to engage their interest but there must also be substantive support of the message. That’s where the data component is decisive, for better or worse. If you need help with creating visualizations “that are thoughtfully designed to impart information and incite action,” look no further.",
    "I’ve never been any good at making charts created in excel or Google sheets look any good and assumed it was just something I was no good at. This book has made a dramatic improvement to not just my charting skills but also to how I structure information in presentations. I’ve gone on to use this book as a reference book whenever I’ve encountered something where I’m struggling to represent numbers as pictures."

    "Rich dad poor dad put the new things in your head, cash flow quadrant organize it!",
    "Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant is the sequel to Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. I was skeptical at first, but I ignored the negative reviews and got a copy, and I don’t regret it. Once I started reading, I couldn’t put it down.\n\nKiyosaki follows his previous book by continuing to emphasize the importance of a “different kind of education” that is founded on an understanding of money. He introduces the Cashflow Quadrant, which, as the name indicates, has four sections: Employees, Self-employees, Business Owners, and Investors. Each quadrant has advantages and disadvantages, and as the author explained, they’re not created equally. It’s crucial to understand each quadrant’s strengths and weaknesses before making a change if you want to maximize your odds of success. Each quadrant has its unique language and requires a specific set of skills to thrive in that role.\n\nWe have all heard the saying, “The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” Most people don’t understand why and how this works. It’s not merely because the rich are rich: they use money differently than the majority. The rich do not work for money to spend it on liabilities. Instead, they invest it on assets that’ll make more money, and as a result, their wealth multiplies. The poor and the middle class, on the other hand, work for a limited income which they spend on liabilities like mortgages, cars, loans, credit cards, and consumer electronics. They often avoid investing because “it’s too risky,” but as the author wrote, and I agree, it’s riskier not to invest.\n\nAnyone can achieve financial success and freedom by increasing their financial IQ and reforming their view of money. A great start is reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad. The majority of us believe that the solution to our financial problems is a raise in salary or winning the lottery, but as Rich Dad often says, “More money will not solve the problem if cash-flow management is the problem.” Debt has become the norm for the U.S. population, and not the right kind of debt that can be used to make a profit, but the kind that keeps you in the rat race.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about this book that I found lacking in its predecessor, were the Rich Dad teachings. You’ll notice more references and lessons from Rich Dad than in the previous book. This book is pure one-on-one financial mentoring.\n\nI do disagree with Kiyosaki on one topic: frugality. Kiyosaki doesn’t believe in frugality. Instead, he believes that “expanding your means” is a better strategy because it forces you to find ways of making more money. Although expanding your means is a good strategy, combining it with frugality would amplify your wealth accumulation faster.\n\nOverall, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to not only improve their financial situation but change the way they think about money.",
    "If you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, then this is the next book to read. It dives further into the quadrant he touches on in the first book.\n\nI see these two books as less about gaining wealth (while that is still a big factor) and more about how to view \"how money is made and by whom.\" Once you get your head around that, the world changes forever.\n\nI'd rather make money work for me than work my life away for money. Wouldn't you? I'd rather make a few smart investments and nurture those lines of income than live paycheck to paycheck. I'd rather live comfortably and enjoy my life than struggle to make ends meet and watch my life pass before my eyes.\n\nIt's not about riches... it's about wealth. It's not about greed... it's about smart financial planning. And guess what? Everyone's invited. Money is color blind. If you can do wonders with it, people will give it to you to make your magic happen. It doesn't matter who you are. Cashflow Quadrant shows you why you need to go from E to I regardless of who you are.\n\nGood luck! Great book. Easy read. You'll never look at making money the same way again... (unless you've read RDPD, in which case... you're already on that journey.) OH!!! And older versions are just as good as the newest one. You won't miss out on anything if you buy the cheapest one. (((Plus, his predictions pre-2008 are crazy and on the mark!)))",
    "As everyone else is saying, this book is a continuation of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, which a lot of people name as an eye opening book.\nCashflow Quadrants has some very interesting points that are very useful for motivating us to find passive forms of income. However, this book is very repetitive to the point of frustration. Also, there are some contradictions that make it difficult to take everything as gospel, especially when it comes to \"Living below your means\", which Robert both advocates in one chapter then turns around and derrides in another.\n\nI do think this book is worth a read, with a discerning eye. There are some things in here that sounds like total huckster territory (like promoting MLMs and promoting his own class program and expensive CashFlow game)... Read it with a skeptics mind and you will pick up on some very useful stuff!",
    "I red this book few years ago. now I am running a nice company. I love it.",
    "Definitely a very valuable read for someone beginning in the world of finance. Robert is giving away the game in this book!",
    "You need to read this book! It is not the best read, not the most enticing and you should read Rich dad poor dad first. You will not gain a world of knowledge from this book either but you will reinforce basic knowledge and gain a fresh and encouraging view on your personal finance situation after reading it. You will also view your employment from another perspective and probably start mentally simulating a path through the quadrants. My advice, read it after Rich dad poor dad, read it fast preferably in a couple of days and understand it. Make parallels between the book and your own life, start thinking differently, get a piece of paper and a pen and ink out possibilities and paths you could take with the ideas from this book.",
    "I read rich dad poor dad and was skeptical about purchasing this one in case there was repetition. This book is so much more in depth than rich dad poor dad. It has opened my eyes even wider. I completely recommend this book to anyone who is serious about changing their life and getting out of that job.",
    "My only criticism is that it covers a lot of the same ground as rich dad poor Dad, but its well written and is an engaging read. Recommended.",
    "Self education is a best education, schools just gives you a basic survival guide, sled education brings to me a fortune 🥠 👍",
    "The second book to read, very worth while. Teaches you some life lessons. Easy read and great to go back to if required."

    "I'm not a Reese Witherspoon book club member. I'm a working mother and wife (I found Fair Play through a recent finance podcast). Two years ago I hit a similar breaking point to the author's \"blueberry meltdown.\" After 13.5 years of marriage, to a man willing to share the work, I woke up and realized he was treating me like a doormat - I'll spare you the details.\n\nI tried and tried strategies to improve my situation. After a few failed mini-efforts (including trading lives for a week to promote empathy), we finally landed on a system that is extremely similar to the cards recommended in Fair Play (we use assignable to-do lists in the Wunderlist App). Every strategy in the Fair Play system is part of our own. We’ve needed it all — the dredging of work from the shadows to the light, the value setting, the ownership from conception to execution, the avoiding using your spouse as back-up for everything, and even the built-in time-off for self-development. We hit bumps. I worried what my in-laws thought — but we stayed the course.\n\nIt worked, and we are better than ever (and, yes, that means more and better sex, too). The system freed us not only from the nit-picky day-to-day misery but also from the feeling we could never leave the house. We found free-time. My husband revels in the friendships and activities he can leave his family for, guilt-free. I traveled for 10 days of business last March (with manageable preparations for my “cards”), and all they missed were hugs.\n\nThe first 100 or so pages of this book set the context for the issues women (largely) are facing. This is the context I lived. It's definitely a downer. I say this to say, that if you need a ‘why' to get yourself moving on this Fair Play plan, then read it. But if you can buy into the plan without it — SKIP it (for now). For husbands/back-up partners: It's hard to stare a problem like this in its face, and still have the energy to do the work. Do the work for your family. Do the work for your daughters (and sons). Do the work for yourself. There are so many issues in life that we can not control: This is one we can.\n\nFair Play will lift women's spirits. Fair Play will make them feel loved. Fair Play will give them back their energy and joy — and they, in turn, will bring their true gifts to you and the world. It is truly one area where you can take a small step for a woman, and a giant leap for MAN- and WOMAN-KIND. (I’m only sorry I can not go back in time and take some cards for my mother.) For what it's worth, it's not men's fault. We are all working hard. Through discussion, we raise our shared-expectations. For some partners in a family it will feel like more work in total. Early in the process, old resentments can sometimes target the system, making things worse. But, if you can get to a place where both partners sincerely try, you will be busier AND happier. TODAY.\n\nIf you choose to play, the time you spend on Fair Play tasks (the grind; emotional labor, etc.) will be what allows you, on your death bed, to look back and say, \"I’m glad I was there for my family.\"",
    "Very interesting and I’d love to see her book and game for parents and teens and young adults at home and how to divide responsibilities! Looking forward to reading Unicorn Space now!",
    "Let me start off by saying that today's book is one that many not be popular in many Christian circles. Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live) by Eve Rodsky is not a \"Christian\" book. In fact a lot of people would probably deem it a feminist text and move on. But, before I jump into that, lets talk about what this book is.\n\nFair Play is an acknowledgement that in most marriages the majority of work inside the home falls primarily on the shoulders of women. In fact, modern women are being CRUSHED by the weight of everything that they are rightly and unjustly expected to do for their families.\n\nFair play is a system that helps couples to balance out the work load. The best part about this book is that Rodsky says clearly how to do that. In a lot of marriage books this idea is summed up as, \"have a conversation with your spouse about responsibilities\" and then they move on. This book IS the conversation you need to have with your spouse, it is also the conversation on how to make the changes needed.\n\nI will say that when my husband and I used this system we had to add in categories because we are a military family and we homeschool. Both of those qualifiers have specific needs and requirements that this book just didn't cover.\n\nNow, as to the idea that this book is unbiblical... if you have read the Bible, sharing one another's burdens and having dominion over your sphere of influence is not a male/female thing. It is a Christian thing. There isn't anything in the Bible that says a man can't help with household chores. The word of God places a great deal of significance on treating one another with respect and a great many Christian marriages could use this book to help get out of some ugly, un-Christlike patterns.\n\nOverall, I give Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live) five stars. I have come back to this book often and I have already loaned it to a friend. While it isn't a Christian book, there isn't anything in the text that compromises my theological standard.",
    "This is a great book, so much work has been put into it. I found it to be very fair for both sides and would recommend to any couple. I have bought 3 as wedding gifts with the cards. The author has thought of most everything and I even found myself saying \"I didn't know I got to count that as work\" because yes buying birthday gifts, wrapping and getting kids to parties is a lot of work!!",
    "Who among us working moms has not felt the pure rage that arises when we've worked a full day at the office but also made the orthodontist appointments, looked into summer camps, put \"find a new math tutor\" on the list, got up at 5 to do the laundry, prepped dinner, cleaned up after breakfast, thought about school application deadlines for the following year, gave the cat his medicine--basically pulled a full-on Alice from The Brady Bunch--while our partner MAYBE drives a kid to practice a couple days a week or loads the dishwasher and then expects a medal plus a TV news crew to come cover it? I want to scream just thinking about this situation that used to be mine. BUT then I read this book and I'm happy to report -- Eve Rodsky has our back! This book saves marriages, sanely. Most partners actually want to be involved 50/50 and FAIR PLAY shows exactly how to do that. Step by actionable step, backed by research and real-life examples. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.",
    "We are a professional working couple with 2 under 4 and I saw this book recommended and I thought it would be a good idea to re balance the work load as I was constantly overwhelmed. It’s only really good if your partner doesn’t do much at all in the house and is extremely reflective and on board for change. I also feel like it was a bit derogatory towards men, it also didn’t account for same sex couples. In my experience sharing this with friends the man has never responded well to the book (which is an issue in itself.) There is no doubt there is a terrible divide in jobs in most households, with women doing so much more (typically) however this doesn’t really solve the problem. Treating your husband like a child doesn’t really work in my opinion. Save yourself some money and just divide jobs in the house. However I think there is great advice is about what the author explains is CPE which means if you’re responsible for a job then you have to conceive the idea, plan it and then execute it. I think that really helps the overwhelm but apart from that, not a good balanced book for couples who are looking for help.",
    "The book constantly assumes you're a woman and sometimes seems more focused on talking about how husbands are useless rather than the actual advice.\n\nIt's weird since in the first chapter she goes about saying how she thinks this will help all kinds of families and co-parents, but then goes through the rest of the book ignoring anything other than a heteronormative dysfunctional couple.\n\nThe method and advice is AMAZING though, so if you can get past the previous stuff, it's really worth the read.",
    "4 wave intersectionality at its worst. Seems intent on telling you how the natural power dynamics of the oppressive man make you the victim.\n\nLazy writing, lazy arguments, childish mindset. Returning.",
    "I really enjoyed this book. I find the idea of turning the management of the household into a game that you both win very interesting. It can be a bit repetitive at times but still a very good read",
    "The tips in this book and method suggested are excellent. I just wish it wasn’t so strongly geared towards women - mostly who are the stay at home or primary parent. I don’t like the way the author degrades the male partner in many of her passive aggressive comments. If I gave this book to my husband to read he would really take offence to that and it would turn him off the idea. I wish they would just generalize this book more so the partner who isn’t pulling their weight is not always the man. Would appeal to an even larger audience and same sex couples as well. No need to put down men as a general whole to make the excellent suggestions this book provides."

    "Fossil Future – Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas – Not less\nAlex Epstein ©2022 (468 pages)\n\na short Book Report by Ron Housley (6.5.2022)\n\nHere is a book that will get attacked the loudest by those who won’t read it. It is a book that questions the catastrophic predictions expected from climate warming; and it is a book contending that killing off fossil fuels could kill off human flourishing itself.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time that a book will have been condemned by those who refuse to read it; but it could be the first time that human flourishing itself was at stake.\n\nAlex Epstein beckons us to take a serious look at the benefits of fossil fuels as our culture is persuaded to embrace a “net zero” goal of abandoning fossil fuels altogether.\n\nEpstein uses the concept of “Knowledge System” --- referring to the chain of information: from the scientist-researchers, to the synthesizers of the research, to the disseminators of research, to the evaluators of research. He points out that these components of the knowledge system are separate entities; and they are each populated by “designated experts.” He shows a clear picture of how information becomes skewed from the moment it leaves the scientists’ hands and becomes processed by an army of synthesizers, disseminators and evaluators. It’s sometimes like a long game of telephone, as information is packaged for various audiences. It is fascinating to see how information presented to us by mainstream disseminators and evaluators often fails to represent what the scientific research itself suggests.\n\nThere is much discussion of the mainstream knowledge system, how it operates on the problematic standard that we should eliminate human impact on the earth; and how it also operates on the questionable standard that the earth is somehow a “delicate nurturer” — i.e., that the earth is clean and safe, except for man making it dirty and dangerous. The mainstream knowledge system embraces both of these operating standards, but rarely states them explicitly.\n\n135 PAGES OF BENEFITS\nA central message here is that regardless of where we stand on the “climate change” controversy, most of us are blind to the vast scale of benefits attributable to fossil fuels. Epstein invests an entire 135 pages breathing life into the picture showing the vast scale of fossil fuel’s positive impact on our every-day lives; he paints a picture that most of us had never before quite conceptualized or appreciated.\n\nAmidst all the talk about negative “externalities” of fossil fuels, we rarely consider the “positive externalities” — which turn out to be incalculably massive.\n\nCLIMATE DENIER — VS — BENEFIT DENIER\nCommon in the national conversation around fossil fuels and their impact on the planet, we hear one side accuse the other of being “climate deniers;” but we don’t hear the other side invoking the “benefit denier” charge. My impression is that both sides have been largely unaware of the magnitude of benefits that are threatened with the calls to eliminate fossil fuels. This book may be the first time most of us will have asked the question: what do we as a species stand to lose if we abandon fossil fuels in our futures? The tentative answer is that we stand to lose all pretense at attaining flourishing or fulfillment on earth. Epstein’s discussion of fossil fuel benefits makes the prospects chillingly real.\n\nCLEAN VS. DIRTY\nOn page 150 we get this: “…fossil fuels haven’t taken a naturally clean environment and made it unnaturally dirty….they’ve taken a naturally dirty environment and made it unnaturally clean.” Fossil fuel’s role in giving us a clean environment is but one small instance of benefits, in all the pages comprising the wonders that fossil fuels bestow to humans. Many of us will find ourselves astonished as we reacquaint ourselves with the myriad of crucial benefits. These are the gazillions of every-day benefits that we not only take for granted, but which were totally unknown to mankind for most of history. These are not only sanitation, medical care, housing, education, recreation, plentiful food and water, technology, but the very ability to achieve fulfillment during our stay on earth.\n\nEpstein makes the point that “the natural unimpacted state of the planet is not conducive to human flourishing” (p 122) and that our abundance is the result of our massive productive ability, which in turn cannot occur without “ultra-cost-effective fossil fuel energy.”\n\nHUMAN FLOURISHING — VS — NO IMPACT\nEpstein encourages us to examine questions about using fossil fuel energy from the standard of “human flourishing,” and not from today’s standard of blocking any impact on nature.\n\nHe points out that the standard of not impacting nature presumes nature to be “stable, sufficient and safe;” but it is not. Instead, he insists, nature is “dynamic, deficient and dangerous” (p. 98) The human flourishing contention is that we can cope with nature as deficient and dangerous — but only by “massive, intelligent human impact on nature.” (p. 103)\n\nWe live in a culture where the knowledge system drives public decisions. It is a knowledge system implying that the benefits of using fossil fuels are trivial, and easy to replace; but those benefits would be impossible to replace. It is a knowledge system which is heavily anti-energy, in spite of energy’s important role in human flourishing. It is a knowledge system invested in ignoring the benefits of fossil fuels while catastrophizing the side-effects. It is a knowledge system that opposes mankind impacting nature.\n\nAs long as the knowledge system continues to oppose mankind impacting nature, Epstein argues, we will risk being on a course to ever less human flourishing.\n\nATMOSPHERIC CO2\n“…today’s CO2 levels are less than one-tenth of the planet’s historical high points — which were some of the most life-friendly times in the planet’s history.” (p. 265)\n\nThe whole conversation addressing atmospheric carbon dioxide carries the implication that higher levels bring disaster. Yet in the history of earth, that has not been the case. So why is it supposedly the case today?\n\nAnd why did historical CO2 concentrations far greater than we have today not result in catastrophic warming, but resulted in the Cambrian explosion of planetary life, instead?\n\nDitto for ignoring the temperature history of earth. History is riddled with ice ages and interglacial periods of warming, all without human produced carbon dioxide. How could there have been such severe fluctuations when man wasn’t yet on the scene to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide?\n\nEpstein is contending not only that the national conversation ignores these important questions about planetary history, but that it also ignores the vast “climate mastery” over fossil fuel side-effects which have developed during over a century of growth.\n\nTHE FUTURE\nAs long as humans have free will, their governing knowledge systems can be rational or irrational. Epstein’s book takes a serious look at the prospect that a couple degrees of temperature change could result in catastrophe for the planet; and he takes a look at how opinions are nudged by the dominant knowledge system.\n\nMost importantly he examines how today’s knowledge system supports “the view that continuing fossil fuel use has no real benefit” (p. 242), a view supported “at the highest levels of influence.” Epstein vividly describes “the apocalypse of fossil fuel elimination” (p. 392) and beckons us not to view it dismissively.\n\nIn the final analysis, Epstein is asking us to reconsider the basic assumptions and framework we use when looking at questions about the climate and fossil fuels; he is looking beneath the surface — at the mental processes at work. He is encouraging us to consider full context, even though our culture favors a more narrow view.\n\nFossil Future is Epstein’s attempt to present a more comprehensive picture of what we’re up against. I hope I’m not over-optimistic in wishing a fair hearing for his book.",
    "What are the true benefits and true costs of humanity's use of fossil fuels? This book is a splendid framework for debate on these issues.\n\nAlex Epstein lays out a case that the true benefits are enormous and the true costs are manageable, sometimes to the point of only mild impacts.\n\nI don't have the expertise to pass definitive judgment on Epstein's claims but what I'll call the enormous true benefits side of the case seems very strong and straightforward.\n\nWhat I'll call the manageable true costs side of the case also seems rather strong to me, but I would frankly urge readers to buy this book to engage with Epstein's argumentation, especially on the issue of the possible cost frequently known as Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (\"CAGW\"). (Epstein doesn't use this particular phrase/acronym but to me it's a fairly widespread term of convenience to describe what folks usually really mean when they talk about \"global warming\" or \"climate change\".)\n\nCAGW may be caused by humans putting too much CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby triggering harmful greenhouse effects. Of course natural climate change, of which global warming seems to be a current trend, is always in play, but the whole point of this discussion is that we are directing our collective attention to the climate change that we may be causing -- anthropogenic -- and which may be very harmful -- catastrophic -- to ourselves and the planet.\n\nIn order to start the ball rolling on this engagement with Epstein's thinking, let me lay out some of his main points about the greenhouse effects from chapter 9, \"Rising CO2 Levels: The Full Context\".\n\nEpstein proposes that there are two possible types of greenhouse effects: first, a well-documented & mild greenhouse effect due solely to increases in CO2; and second, a speculative, \"significantly amplified\" greenhouse effect that would be caused by the impact of increased CO2 in turn causing a massive increase in production of water vapor (which is another greenhouse gas). I'll call the first type the direct greenhouse effect and the second type the significantly amplified greenhouse effect. The significantly amplified effect includes the direct effect as a pre-condition.\n\nEpstein proposes four points squarely relating to the direct greenhouse effect, that there are \"four basic truths about the history of climate\" that lead him to conclude we are not headed for a CAGW disaster.\n\"1. The global climate system is near historic lows in CO2 and temperature. 2. We have no near-term mechanism of reaching even one fourth the historical high of CO2. 3. Life on Earth thrived at far higher CO2 levels and temperatures in the past. 4. Planetary warming is concentrated in colder parts of the Earth -- it is not truly global.\"\n\nFurther to these points is the \"unanimous consent in mainstream climate science\" that the relationship of increasing CO2 to increasing the direct greenhouse effect is a \"diminishing, logarithmic effect\", such that the greenhouse effect \"from CO2 by itself translates into about 1o C every time the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere doubles.\" The attached graph may help illustrate this proposed effect.\n\nSo Epstein writes that the first type of greenhouse effect -- the CO2 greenhouse effect -- is \"a diminishing effect that on its own would not lead us to expect concerning warming in the future.\"\n\nConcerning the second type of greenhouse effect, he continues, \"Claims that warming will be far more rapid than the [direct] greenhouse effect suggests are based on a significantly amplified greenhouse effect.\"\n\nAnd more: \"The main mechanism posited is that the greenhouse effect of CO2 in the atmosphere will greatly amplify water vapor creation in the atmosphere, which could cause much more warming than the CO2 acting alone would. This kind of reinforcing interaction is called a positive feedback loop.\"\n\nBut: \"There are three crucial things to recognize about the positive feedback loops that supposedly contribute to a significantly amplified greenhouse effect: (1) they are limited by the diminishing nature of the [direct] greenhouse effect, (2) even extreme projections of warming would be masterable, and (3) the extreme projections are highly speculative and unlikely to come true.\"\n\nI hope that this small sample of Epstein's thinking -- as clumsily rephrased by me -- will prompt you to get this book and study it. The stakes are enormous and the more eyes we have on these issues the better.",
    "An importantn contribution to the climate change debate.\nComprehensive, includes a scientific and moral rebuttal of all the green fanatics basic anti-human rhetoric.\nI was especially pleased to read his exposure of the fraudulent central pillar of the green cult’s “computer climate modelling” argument.\nAs someone who worked in computer training simulators for many years , I absolutely KNOW that this is a wide open area of abuse of the facts, replacing them with pure fantasy.\nWell done Alex.",
    "Everyone needs to read this. I see the climate catastrophists are already dishonestly reviewing a book they have not read and disingenuously trying to cancel its author. If that is not reason enough to buy this book, here is another - it is genuinely brilliant.",
    "This is a somewhat over-hyped ridiculous book, which endlessly quotes the author.\nAE makes 'straw men' arguments throughout- where he creates extreme scenarios and then attacks those, despite these never been said or written. For example, he bases an early foundation premise on the lack of electricty in a hospital 'Africa' on an unverified blog and bases his argument on that. The hospital is not named nor is there a date for when this is supposed to happen.\nThe countries of Africa get barely a mention in the book, despite huge programmes in renewables and solar energy being implemented 'there'.\nThe author , in Chapter 9 makes a big point about levels of carbon dioxide being good for 'life'. He is very careful not to say 'human life'- plant life may well benefit from carbon dioxide. Omissions are important.\nThis leads me to the biggest gaps in the argument.\nAE not once addresses how his 'mastery methods'- which of course are not outlined in specific detail, just waved at- will lower the rising global temperature or lower the rising carbon dioxide level.\nThis is a central point, for the future use of fossil fuels, which he ignores.\nHe also does not address the impact of rising CO2 or temperature on countries, infrastructure and people, meaning there can be no justification for continued fossil fuel use.\nThe author is a philosophy graduate, in no way qualifed or experienced to write on energy matters. And it shows. Far too many general vague points- for example, he spends 3 pages outlining why fossil fuel machines will help people have 'thinking time' (for real, this isn't a joke) and how that will be a benefit. Avoiding of course the impact on the labour market. Another 3 pages are spent describing what a 'tool' is.\nThis is a book that can easily be dismissed by simply looking out your window and seeing the impact of the climate crisis. Yet supporters are lapping this book up, despite not having read it themselves, which is peculiar.",
    "\"Fossil Future\" by Alex Epstein is about how to think about energy. Epstein points out that by the standard of valuing human life and prosperity, fossil fuels have made the world a better place. This is because fossil fuels provide concentrated, cheap, reliable energy that is suitable for many purposes including transport, electricity generation and industrial heat: it gives people a lot of power to change the environment to make it better for human life. By contrast, renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy are dilute, expensive and unreliable and so their adoption instead of fossil fuels would destroy civilisation by depriving us of the energy needed to power our lives. Epstein also considers other sources of energy such as nuclear energy which could be improved to make it a better competitor to fossil fuels if environmentalists would get out of the way because it is safer and more concentrated even than fossil fuels. The book explains why the institutions most people rely on for their information, such as the media and the IPCC, say that fossil fuels are bad and renewable energy is good and how to use the information they provide to improve your knowledge instead of accepting what their public spokesmen say.",
    "Mr Epstein's message can be summed up in a few simple paragraphs, his evidence in maybe a dozen more. This tome drags on for over 400 pages. Repetitive does not begin to describe what a drag this book is. It needs severe editing, we do not need the silly headlines that break the flow of what little narrative there is. It's a shame because Epstein is probably on the right of this climate change deceit. This could have been an important book but it fails the readability test badly. Maybe Americans, to whom Epstein is clearly addressing his message, like this style of badgering they are welcome to it."

    "I read the book many years ago. Gave an updated book us a gift.",
    "Really loved all of the content. One of the best books I have read on this subject.",
    "Recently graduated with a master's degree and faced with writing a CV and other tasks. I'm not new to these exercises, competing them for the career change really helped me hone in on what to write for the teaching philosophy, cover letter, and other surprise requests that came along with applying for a new job field.",
    "The content of this book was fine, but there were some serious technical issues with the Kindle version.\n\nFirst of all, there were at least four or five occasions when I got an error message stating that I would have to go back to the Amazon website and download the book again. It was not possible to use the book at all without doing so. Amazon recommended reducing the font size, which I did, but the problem persisted.\n\nSecondly, when I used the \"go to\" feature and went to page 148, then when I would try to go to the next page, it would take me back to page 124 instead. I tried this countless times on numerous occasions and it always happened. So, then I decided to use the \"go to\" feature to get to page 149. But whenever I tried to do that, it took me directly to the end of the book. This always happened on many attempts. The only way to access page 149 was to go to the beginning of the chapter and flip through every single page. Chapter 6 starts on page 110, so that was 39 pages I had to flip through one at a time.\n\nThirdly, some pages, like the example of how someone else did the flower exercise, were just too small to read on the Kindle version, and I am not aware of any way to make it larger.\n\nI have never experienced these first two issues with any other ebook ever, and I read 66 books in 2021, most of which were ebooks. On Amazon, this book is specifically listed as \"Great on Kindle\", so I expected better. I contacted Penguin Random House weeks ago, but no one has gotten back to me.",
    "Few books have ever provided me with the kind of clarity this book has as to what direction I need to pursue a professional future. This should be a must read for anyone contemplating how they are wired and how their wiring fits with a \"real\" job. I wish I had read this in the later part of my collegiate journey (the first time). Read it. Do the exercises.",
    "I've been looking for the most recent edition of this book.",
    "Quick delivery and the book in excellent shape as described.",
    "Excellent resource for life’s work search.",
    "This book claims to be all things to everyone (unemployed, graduate , 30+ years) and ultimately serves none well. Having devoted a significant amount of time reading and doing the exercises it feels like a management consultant selling your thoughts back to you - you will learn very little. 2 hour job search is a significantly better , briefer and actually enjoyable read - and doesn’t claim to tell you what you should do - which this book does not.\nSave the money and time , go elsewhere.",
    "I bought this book 30 years ago, followed the instructions in it and am still enjoying the fulfilling career it led me to. And I continue to purchase this book for others. I just bought it for my grown children and hope they both receive huge benefits from it. Really, this is one of the most meaningful and important books I have ever read. Highly recommend.",
    "Way back in 1995 when I was looking for a job a friend of mine gave me this book. I found it to be super valuable with many great ideas. Over the years I was pleased to give current editions of this book to people who were job searching. In 2022 I am pleased to be able to once again give this book to a friend.",
    "Thoroughly enjoyable and useful book to find your true north once again! Highly recommended read!"

    "This is hands down one of my new favorites! I couldn’t put it down. Any free time I had, it was in my hands.\n\nThis book is full of so much knowledge on how to properly feel/work through all the emotions. I’m so grateful I stumbled across this on a podcast from someone that recommended it on School of greatness.\n\nI can’t wait to purchase more of Thibauts books. Beautifully written and so easy to read. I will forever recommend this book to everyone!\n\nThank you!",
    "What i liked about this book is that it gave me the ability to really understand the emotions I feel. This book taught me that do not take emotions serious and they are not me , just the person experiencing the emotion. That made me feel ALOT better about the emotions I feel on a day to day basis. The work book at the end of the book helped me to better organize my thoughts and emotions and to better understand why I Feel the way I feel day to day.",
    "Not too much I didn't like.I've read similar books in the past ! A great book.A doctor or I should say a psychiatrist told my mother something during a phone conversation. I was in a psychiatric ward in a facility three thousand miles away from my home ..Buffalo,Newyork.Mrs. Surncey your son Clifford has suffered from what we call an Emotional Episode. When I was younger i been enjoyed watching soap operas.The Young and the Restless and of course now instead of General The VA hospital",
    "Love this book it’s easy to understand and practical. I feel this book is one for our library ;where we can always re-read when we get caught up in life and forget about ourselves and what really is important for our own emotional well-being.",
    "I like the fact that it's an easy read and makes so much sense . Very thought provoking. It makes you want to examine your motives and emotions.",
    "For the most part this was an easy to read, well put together book. I found it helpful in my process of learning to deal with my emotions and not taking things personally. The place I got lost was the chapter on Enneagram. It was too confusing without knowing which number I was. It also felt forced and not this authors natural flow. However that aside I felt it was an excellent addition to my healing process.",
    "This book is an easy read with actionable sets to implement into one’s daily life. The suggestions in this book are assessable, they make sense to help a person navigate the tough times.",
    "I honestly believe that my emotions control me with this book has helped me control my emotions. The workbook is in the back of the book it is very helpful to keep track of what you were reading",
    "It seems as though this author simply read a dozen or so self-help books and reorganized some of their recommendations. There is almost no insights as to how emotions work. There are almost no references to scientific literature and there is no evidence that the author has any deep level of knowledge on the subject.\n\nI see from reviews that many people seem to like the book, perhaps it works well for people who very much like simple books without much depth.\n\nThe book is quite short, but the content could actually be delivered concisely in about 10-15 pages. There just isn’t much material.\n\nWith that said, there are some good points in it. The chapter explaining that other people do not really spend time thinking or judging you is good.",
    "I have made detailed notes of the book. It is truly excellent - each chapter is short enough and powerful enough to give you some real strategies to master emotions. I like the first part of the text where the author puts emotions in context and firmly suggests we all can master emotions when we understand how we manufacture them through our thinking. It is great self empowerment book. I believe the book was worth the price simply for the chapter on self motivation. He also provides a free workbook which you can download. Beware the website is not that user friendly so you may have to email the author to get the workbook. I emailed him straight away and the workbook was in my in tray the following day.",
    "This book is amazing it’s literally like my little bible at the moment. I suffered a huge breakdown in recent years and it really compromised my ability to function, I was always lost in my thoughts and I was suffering horrendously. In a couple of month this book has taught me more than what the secondary mental health services have ever managed too and I’ll be forever grateful for that. I’ve read this book through fully three times and I’m constantly going back too certain sections too refresh myself and it’s always close by. I struggle to retain information so the fact everything is laid out so simply but yet described perfection is amazing. If you are looking at gaining some understanding of how your thought process works and how to better managed your thoughts and feelings then this really is the book for you.\n\nMany thanks to the Author him self Mr Thibaut, you have helped me so much on my personal development journey, thank you",
    "I've waited until I've finished reading the book (strugglingly!) to write a review, and I'm really sad to say that this book was a total disappointment. It is filled with a very simplistic view of how to fix things that it made me completely go crazy, such as \"if you suffer from X, do meditation\": there's no problem with such an approach, but (1) what I'm I supposed to learn from this recommendation (\"Oh thank you so much, now I will do meditation and will heal!\") (2) there are thousand of books on meditation, each long pages and pages of content, and here this practice is reduced in one word \"meditation\": what am I supposed to do? Buy another book? Then what's the goal of this book? (The previous is just an example -- the book is filled with these sorts of \"advice\".) Most of the things written in the books are found elsewhere, where they described much better -- the book is merely a recollection of some sort of \"recipes\" found here and there without any logic and reported in just one sentence each. From an editorial point of view, the book is poorly organized, to say the least. There are some chapters that are 1 or 2 pages long (especially in the first part of the book) with absolutely no meaning or with overly simplistic advice \"Do it, trust me!\". The chapter on Procrastination, for some obscure reason, is instead very long and filled with 16 pieces of \"Advice\", with no logic or order, and I had to force myself finishing that chapter. Another thing that is very annoying about this book is that the author often refers to other parts of this book such as \"more info on this can be found on chapter XXX\", with absolute no reference at the page where to find this information, which makes the search (assuming one is interested in searching the content) overly complicated. The book is also full of \"exercises\" that no person on earth can do, such as \"keep making a list of when you do this and this, keep a list of when you think about this, keep a list of what you are doing at this time, etc etc\": how are people supposed to find all the time to write this stuff? Similarly, there is a continuous reference from the author to the \"workbook\", which is on the back of the book which is irritating (why should I go back and forth? just split the content of the workbook and put the split content at the end of each chapter for simplicity!) and, as said above, no time for such stuff.\n\nI hope the author of this book reads this review, as he recommends people to write a review once finishing reading the book as feedback/comments are useful, so here is mine: I've spent a considerable amount of time/effort into reading this book, and I haven't found anything useful or worth remembering at all. I believe that writing a book is a practice that requires lots of skills and knowing the profession in depth and to take this work (=being a writer) seriously -- it is not just that anyone can write a book as they want to \"help people\" and that's it. Who is gonna give me the time back I've spent reading this book?\n\nFor people who are wondering whether to buy this book, if you are interested in self-development, just spare your money and time and buy some decent book, e.g., \"Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world\", \"The Chimp Paradox: Mind Management \", or \"The Art of Living\" or even any Eckhart Tolle books (although not my favourite author, but still better that this book) are a much better choice.",
    "I bought this book on a whim with the mindset that it could give me a lil insight in to emotions (which I thought I already knew how to manage). Well it turned out that i let my emotions get the better of me regularly, and wasn't even realising the implications! Through out the book he gives detailed examples and exercises that you can do to manage emotions, and they've helped me a lot with my day to day dealings with people and situations. This book really left a impression on me, so much so that I bought it for a close family member currently going through a difficult time. Even if you feel like you have a strong grasp on your emotions, this book is still well worth the read! I'm sure I'll come back to this book periodically for help in tough situations. Deserved 5 stars!!!"

    "I am a small business owner who chose to break off from the traditional healthcare model to practice medicine differently. As someone who does not have any experience with business and managing cash flow... this book was life changing. I went from not even understanding if I was going to survive a small start up business, to being confident my business would not only survive, but was thriving. The principles in the book are basic, which is exactly what I needed. My CPA understood why I was using the Profit First model and supported me. It gave me peace of mind that I could afford to pay myself and that I was not overspending on my business expenses.",
    "This book changed my outlook on where my money should go. I started my business with very little overhead so most of the money was profit. I had all this money in the bank and no clue what to do with it. I was afraid to spend it or pay myself so it was just there. After reading the book and setting up all my accounts it so much clearer how to allocate the money. I was able to pay myself with no fear. Now we are expanding and will be adding some overhead while also adding profit. I’m excited to take Profit First to the next level.",
    "I love efficiency! And in general an envelope system is a great way to do that...but with actual physical envelopes, it gets a little cumbersome.\n\nThis year, I implemented Profit First in my business as I read this book. It was one of the first books I read.\nI love the siplicity & actionable steps that Mike provides. Some people have complained that there's nothing ground-breaking here but I tend to disagree.\n\nMost people I've worked with as a small business systems consultant need a little help organizing most parts of their business. That includes their money. Whether they're just starting out or have been in business nearly 10 years, some haven't quite figured out how to manage the money in a way that allows them to have some left over at the end. And at the same time, removes the hassle of physical money management (envelopes and cash). Each account makes your numbers visible at a glance!!!\n\nThis book gives you a system to do just that. Turning a money gobbler into an organized set of pre-assigned buckets for each of your business dollars.\n\nFor someone who loves both numbers and systems, the Profit First method has given me both. Got to say that having the ability to actually draw a profit in the first quarter this year and KNOWING what that amount should be has been powerful! The emotional ups and downs of running your own business can be challenging. And seeing that profit account grow gives you something to look forward to as you work through the good and the rough days of owning a business!\n\nMike provides guidelines for how to handle the lingering questions about managing the $$ that come up for a lot of business owners. I've shared this book with multiple business owners since reading and implementing it in my own business.\n\nIf you're in a spot where you're unsure about how to organize your business finances or haven't taken a profit distribution in years, or haven't ever even had a profit to speak of, this book is a great place to get started!!\n\nDefinitely worth reading! Really glad I implemented it!\nI've even started using this as a client gift during my process and systems work with clients. And so far, everyone I've sent it to has given it rave reviews as well.",
    "I heard about this book on The Kelly Roach podcast and immediately purchased it. I just launched my personal styling business in 2020 and new I needed to get a handle on my business finances. Having used the envelope system back when I first started getting an allowance as a 12 year old, I have always been a fan of the concept. This is more than that and makes complete and total sense. I know it will be a great system to get my business finances healthy and thriving moving forward. I wish I had this on day one, I'd be so much better off. -- Shannon A.",
    "Update: May 11, 2019 ***\n\nI was just browsing Amazon and came across this book again. I thought it would be helpful to give an update. My first review was probably October 2018. The advice / method in the book really worked for us and it has helped us so much that I tell every business owner about the method.\n\nI went back and reread the book in December to make sure we were doing it right. We were but we tweaked some things in Feb. (Like I take profit out every month - 100% of what I saved) We still do our cash flow and pay bills 3 times a week - doesn't work for us to do it 2 times a month. Too many bills since we do a lot of manufacturing. Although we are now starting to get ahead of bills by a week or two so when that happens we reduce how often we sit and do cash flow and pay bills.\n\nWe started out doing 3% profit and now were are up to 8.5%\n\nFor the first time ever I wasn't angry about paying taxes. Having a separate account to save for that is brilliant. We save for end of year taxes, payroll taxes and estimated taxes. We had $8000 or $9000 extra in the account after April 15 so we moved that money to pay off our Line of Credit (taken out a few years ago when we owed so much in taxes and had not saved)\n\nI don't wake up with the sick feeling every day wondering if enough money is coming in to pay the bills.\n\nWe made some other changes to stop the roller coaster since we do manufacturing we get a lot of money in and then a lot of money out.\n\nWe pay payroll every week - not every 2 weeks.\nWe moved other things to pay once a week instead of every month or 2 weeks. Just\nhelps us (having payroll taxes in another account that is saved for helps as well since that was a big expense once a month)\n\nPersonally we also set up accounts differently. I pay my car payment once a week (1/4th of a payment), my line of credit also once a week. I also put in 1/4 of my mortgage into a savings account since they only let me pay them once a month. All of that reduces strain and the roller coaster balances.\n\nUnion bank is trying to charge me fees for so many transfers per month. I've been in talks with them as I'm not happy that they are charging me when it is in between my own accounts and it isn't a cost to them however since we are far more stable and profitable now, I am starting to reduce how often I transfer the funds out of income into Profit 1, Taxes, Sales Tax, Profit 2 (college account) and then to Operating expenses. It was every day before but now we are getting down to 2 times a week.\n\nHope this helps! By the way, I'm still shocked it works or makes a difference. I thought we were frugal before so I'm not sure how we are seeing more profit but we are.\n______\n\nMy husband and I have had a business for over 14 years. We first read and started implementing the plan in the book about 2 weeks ago. I found the book helpful. Some solid new ideas that I've not read anything else. It did help us to pull out taxes and a small amount of profit first before putting the rest into an operating expense account. We used to take an owners draw when we had a large positive swing in cash flow. Later we'd be scrambling to pay payroll or sales tax . Now I feel like I have a bit more control over our income and expenses. Basic premise is about changing human behavior. When you make more you tend to spend more. You wonder where the cash went at the end of the year and you're upset that you owe a lot in taxes and dont' have the money. Overall I feel like we have a better pulse on our cash flow and can do something immediately if we notice that it has dropped too far. The Author recommends doing bills on the 10th and 25th. I think that might work for us in 6 months or a year but for now 2 times a week is better while we get things back under control. Hope to finally get into a habit of once a week in the next month. We pay ourselves and our employees once a week now because it made cash flow more even and our employees appreciate seeing a check once a week too.\n\nDont' expect the author to be. an accounting genius - you'll be disappointed however the ideas he has come up with do seem to help. It is about human behavior and changing it by putting some checks and balances in place.",
    "I LOVE this book! I've been following the work of T Harv Eker and Ann Wilson regarding how to manage my personal finances for a number of years, and this book takes the simple idea of Paying yourself first to another level, specifically for your business.\n\nI trained with KPMG Chartered Accountants in the 80's so I'm familiar with the idea that Revenue - Expenses = Profit, but the simple idea of rewriting this as Revenue - Profit = Expenses, seems so simple and yet it's a huge paradigm shift.\n\nI bought the book initially on Audible, read it in two days, then bought the hard back on Amazon, and then signed up for the course with Creative LIve. I also wrote to Mike with a question, which he responded to within hours, twice. The one thing that surprised and delighted me this morning was that someone who I perceive as being an expert, could be so approachable, and so freely respond to my question, with no agenda. I feel extremely grateful to Mike for his work and his prompt, thoughtful reply. I've been recommending the book to all my friends and fellow entrepreneurs. It is now one of my favourite finance books. A must read for anyone in business.",
    "Oooof. This book made me take a long, hard look at my finances and I did not like what I saw.\n\nSome books are life-changing, and I think this is one of them. I loved it. Because, like many business owners, I often don’t really know what’s going on with my numbers... and that’s a problem.\n\nMaybe this sounds familiar to you: “You’ve done great! You’ve made a profit of [lots of moolah] after taxes and expenses!” And you do a little jig, because how cool is that?\n\nOnly... where is that money? It’s certainly not sitting in a fat pile in your bank account, is it? So you look at your accountant, perplexed, and say, “Wait. I’ve made all that profit... but where is it?”\n\n“Oh, it’s gone,” she says airily. “You’ve spent it.”\n\n“What? How can it be profit then?”\n\nAt which point your head explodes.\n\nWell, this is the book you need to read. It helped me understand exactly what's going on.\n\nThe author has been in exactly our position – and much, much worse. He’s gone from millions in the bank to his last few quid – then lost that. And he’s been as confused as the rest of us.\n\nSo he wrote this book to come up with a system that works for real humans. Because (sorry accountants!) most of us business owners do not and will not ever think like accountants. We will not sit for hours poring over statements and spreadsheets and profit and loss calculations. We just won’t.\n\nSo the author came up with the Profit First system. My accountant tells me it’s the accounting system under another name, but that’s the point. He uses normal-people words, ideas, and examples. He takes accounts and puts them in a format I can understand – and gives me a system I can not only understand but will actually use.\n\nWhen you’ve read the book, do the things the author tells you to do. Do the instant assessment of your business. It’ll hurt, but only briefly – then you can start to fix things. This is one of those things you won’t want to do because it’s scary. But once you face the music and know exactly what’s what, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted.\n\nThis is a beautifully simple book that takes a complicated subject and makes it easy to understand for those of us who can't get their heads around traditional accounts.",
    "The problem is that the 'programme' of Profit First involves opening a bunch of extra bank accounts (one for profit, one for tax, one for expenses etc etc) so that you are putting money aside and not over-spending what you don't really have. And - that's a huge ask and I'm not going to do it. In a nutshell. The palaver involved in changing direct debits and standing orders, setting up new ones, dealing with 5 extra cheque books and bank cards for my 5 accounts... Phewie, there's just no WAY I'm getting into all that!\n\nI get the basic premiss: Put the focus on profit. Know what your profit really is, after expenses, so you don't over-spend and go from elaborate spending to scrimping and saving, backwards and forwards...\n\nBut I think I prefer the simpler system, which is: Constantly try to save more money. Reduce expenses as low as they can go. It's working for me anyhow.\n\nIn short: If you're not prepared to do some pretty radical stuff involving your finances and bank accounts, don't bother getting the book.",
    "Well. What can I say. Some books leave imprints on your heart and you are never the same. And, Profit First is one of those books.\nThis year am committed to understanding and managing my finances and making a profit in my business.\nBy staying open and listening to my heart and taking the first steps, reading Profit First and watching the YouTube videos...and opening my Profit First account...I feel confident in achieving my heart's desire.\nMike has written a gem of a book which shows you how easy it is to manage your finances. I am excited and will be 're-reading and applying the techniques and mind set shifts as I go along.\n\nHighly recommend this book if you are looking for ways to reduce your debt and live a profitable and fun life, without stress or struggle. Thank you.",
    "Wow, this is the book I've been searching for since I started my business nearly 10 years ago!\n\nFinance has always been one of the biggest challenges of growing a business and I've always found it way too complex.\n\nThe other big problem is that all you focus on is making profit, and you only find out if you've made a profit retrospectively.\n\nWhat I love about the Profit First system is that you focus on ensuring you make a profit from day one.\n\nWe've also believed in the idea that you need to re-invest to build the business and while that has been a success, I can now see that we could have continued to grow the business, provide a great service to our clients and achieve what we wanted, while still making a healthy profit along the way.\n\nI honestly wish I'd read this 10 years ago... It's a top 10 must read business book for me and I've read a lot.\n\nFocus on making a consistent profit and the rest becomes a great deal easier..."

    "Everybody in the world of technology talks about the Metaverse. But no two people among them seem to agree on what it is, how it will be built, who if anyone will control it, and when it will become a reality. Tech investor Matthew Ball sets out to address this problem in The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything. Building on his own tongue-twisting definition, Ball shares his views on all these questions. Just don’t be surprised after reading the book if you still don’t have a clue what the Metaverse will be like if and when it comes into being. And, despite the promise of the book’s subtitle, you won’t know much about “how the Metaverse will revolutionize everything.” But you will know the right questions to ask.\n\nQUESTIONS YOU MAY NOT WANT TO ANSWER\nMany readers will confront the same challenge I did when reading this book. As Ball sees it, online gaming will be front and center in the Metaverse. My own experience in this field is limited to a single game. Solitaire. So it’s difficult for me to look toward a day when I will adapt an avatar to make my way through the precincts of the Metaverse. Ball’s account implies we’ll all have to do that, assuming the Metaverse replaces the Internet as we know it today. Why will I need to take on a fictitious role to buy books for my Kindle on Amazon? What’s the point? And will I have to wear a headset or goggles, which seems to be in the cards, too? I’m sure many who read this review will have the same questions. And Ball doesn’t answer them. But he gets credit for raising them.\n\nA TONGUE-TWISTING DEFINITION OF THE METAVERSE\nBall devotes the first third of his book sharing his definition of the Metaverse as he envisions it and then, word by word, unpacking it. In fairness, once you’ve passed that point, the definition makes sense. For the record, though, here is is:\n\n“A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”\n\nIf you understand all that on first reading, you’re better attuned to the online world than I am. And I began doing business on the Internet more than thirty years ago.\n\nYou may notice that Ball’s definition makes no mention of Web 3.0, which many people seem to confuse with the Metaverse. Wikipedia’s definition may help dispel that confusion: “Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.” As Ball notes, those concepts might be features of the Metaverse. But the Metaverse won’t necessarily displace the World Wide Web.\n\nTHE COMPANIES AT THE FOREFRONT IN DEVELOPING THE METAVERSE\nAs the author makes clear, none of this is possible today. And it may not be for many years to come. However, he describes a mind-boggling array of hardware and software approaches under development to make Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices more accessible and less costly. Apparently, dozens of companies are engaged in this work. The biggest players Ball identifies include both the usual suspects (Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft) and the leaders in the online gaming industry. Those Ball sees in the forefront are Nvidia (which makes the chips that power online gaming), Sony, Unity Technologies (a leader in online 3D visuals), Roblox (which makes popular online games), Nintendo, and Chinese technology company Tencent.\n\nAnother source names an overlapping set of eight companies that are investing big-time in the Metaverse. Microsoft. Meta (formerly Facebook). Google. Nvidia. Unity Software. Shopify (an online e-commerce platform). Roblox. And Qualcomm (a semiconductor company working with Microsoft on Augmented Reality). But, as Ball makes clear, hundreds of companies have set out to compete in this space.\n\nOUTSTANDING QUESTIONS\nBall’s account raises several big questions:\n\n** Will the Metaverse swallow up the Internet as we know it today, or simply represent a new, three-dimensional layer atop the Internet? Or, for that matter, something entirely independent of it?\n\n** Will an independent, nonprofit entity come into being to write and administer the standards for the Metaverse, as is the case with the Internet today? Or will it become solely controlled by profit-making corporations?\n\n** Which, if any, of the big companies now investing heavily in the Metaverse will emerge bigger and stronger? And will any of them shrink to second-class status (or even go out of business)?\n\n** Will it be necessary to don Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality headsets or goggles to enter the Metaverse? Or will some form of brain-to-computer interface emerge as a less intrusive alternative?\n\nBall advances an answer to the second of these questions. “A ‘corporate internet,’ he writes, “is the current expectation for the Metaverse. The internet’s nonprofit nature and early history stems from the fact that government research labs and universities were effectively the only institutions with the computational talent, resources, and ambitions to build a ‘network of networks,’ and few in the for-profit sector understood its commercial potential. None of this is true when it comes to the Metaverse. Instead, it is being pioneered and built by private businesses, for the explicit purpose of commerce, data collection, advertising, and the sale of virtual products.”\n\nA GRIM WORD OF WARNING\nBall is pessimistic about the impact of the Metaverse. “[F]ears of a Metaverse dystopia seem fair, rather than alarmist. The very idea of the Metaverse means an ever-growing share of our lives, labor, leisure, time, wealth, happiness, and relationships will be spent inside virtual worlds, rather than just extended or aided through digital devices and software. It will be a parallel plane of existence for millions, if not billions, of people, that sits atop our digital and physical economies, and unites both. As a result, the companies that control these virtual worlds and their virtual atoms will likely be more dominant than those who lead in today’s economy.” A grim forecast, indeed.\n\nTHE ROADBLOCKS ON THE WAY TO THE METAVERSE\nThe author cites numerous technological challenges that confront those who are now attempting to build the Metaverse. Chief among them is latency. That’s the difficulty of transmitting enormous amounts of data at speeds high enough not to frustrate users. But there are many others. “We are far from being able to replicate the density and flexibility of the ‘real world,'” Ball notes. But he implies that the business practices of Apple and Google today represent a much bigger roadblock. Ball cites Apple’s in particular. “Apple does not want a Metaverse comprised of integrated virtual world platforms, but of many disparate virtual worlds that are interconnected through Apple’s App Store and the use of Apple’s standards and services.” If the former happens, Apple will lose money. A lot of it. If the company instead manages to nudge the Metaverse in the direction of the latter, it will add trillions to its market capitalization and cast an even larger shadow over Planet Earth.\n\nBut Ball seems to view it as equally likely that other players will emerge on top. “The Metaverse offers the opportunity to disrupt today’s gatekeepers, such as Apple or Google, but many fear that we’ll just end up with new ones—maybe Roblox Corporation, or Epic Games.” Heaven forfend!\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMatthew Ball is the CEO of Epyllion, a diversified holding company which makes angel investments, provides advisory services, and produces television, films, and video games. He is also a Venture Partner at Makers Fund, Senior Advisor to KKR, Senior Advisor to McKinsey & Company, and sits on the board of numerous start-ups. The Metaverse is his first book. Ball is also an “Occasional Contributor” to The Economist, holds bylines at Bloomberg, The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and wrote the August 8, 2022 cover story for Time Magazine.",
    "This book is divided into three parts, with 15 chapters, and a total of about 309 pages not including the Notes section.\n\nIn the Introduction, Ball describes some of the ways that the financial sector and even governments of the world have already begun to prepare for the changes brought about by the Metaverse. Ball cites recent IPOs and statements by large corporations as evidence of upcoming changes, and also gives some historical examples of anticipating the effects of new technology.\n\nIn Part One – “What is the Metaverse?” Ball explains some basic concepts and covers the history of early proto-Metaverse ideas and software. He acknowledges the early contributions of science fiction writers, and documents the importance of games like Second Life. Ball also includes some warnings about attempts by corporations to control the Metaverse, and confusion about what a Metaverse-centered future will look like. In Chapter 3 Ball gives his own definition of the Metaverse and elaborates on each part of his definition.\n\nIn Part Two – “Building the Metaverse” Balls starts to get into some of the technical challenges that will need to be overcome to bring about this new generation of technology. Balls discusses bandwidth and latency issues, CPUs and GPUs, and game engines and Integrated Virtual World Platforms. He explores interoperability issues, and future hardware development. There are also chapters on payment systems and blockchain technologies, and here Balls goes into detail about some potential paths the monetization of the Metaverse might take.\n\nPart Three- “How the Metaverse will Revolutionize Everything” focuses on predicting some of the changes that will come with a Metaverse-centered culture. Ball discusses timelines, MetaBusinesses, and lifestyle and entertainment products. He briefly discusses changes to fashion, industry, and even sex work. He predicts Metaverse winners and losers, and analyzes which current tech giants are in the best position to take advantage of Metaverse opportunities. Finally, he wraps up this section by contemplating issues of identity, rights, and government concerns in this future Metaverse world.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading this book. Balls covers a wide range of potential issues with this new age of technology, all while drawing insights from previous technology-induced shifts in modern culture. He gives predictions about what will happen and who will stand to benefit the most, and his historical examples really serve to illustrate his points. This is a great book to read if you want to start thinking about what the future of technology will look like, and it is written in a way that is very accessible to most people.",
    "Reluctantly, I have to admit this is an interesting and worthwhile book. My starting position was a sceptic of the claims for the metaverse, but I tried to approach it with an open mind. I'm still sceptical about many aspects, but Matthew Ball convincingly puts across a bigger picture that encompasses far more that the demos we've seen so far.\n\nMy initial scepticism was based on experience with Second Life, the 3D virtual environment started in 2003. In its early days, lots of people over-hyped this - big companies set up a presence in it, we were told we would be attending lectures, concerts and meetings this way... but it simply couldn't deliver. My mental picture of the metaverse was primarily an enhanced Second Life, and I think a lot of people see it that way (including some of the big online companies) - but Ball's vision is of something distictly different.\n\nHe gives us a picture of a metaverse that, like the internet is universal, not the property of a single company. Everything within it shares standards (again, like the internet) so, for example, an avatar from one company's part of the metaverse can be transferred to another, just as we can move a JPEG picture from, say, Facebook to a Microsoft app. He also envisages having good, real-time rendered 3D worlds that are synchronous (i.e. everyone sees the same things happening at the same time without buffering), persistent (so things are still there when you leave and come back) and have what he calls 'continuity of data' - so things like payments, identity and more are shared throughout.\n\nWhat he's describing is something more like a three-dimensional visual internet. I say visual, but just as quite a lot of the current internet is not visual, even though we tend to think of elements like web pages and streaming video, similarly Ball's metaverse would have plenty of non-visual components - it's just the 3D visual environment is a key aspect of what makes it next generation. One of my biggest bugbears with virtual reality (VR) is the need for clumsy headsets - I'm not convinced they will ever become mainstream outside of gaming. Apart from anything else, when I sit at my desk with a couple of conventional screens in front of me, or use my phone, I'm also interfacing with the real world - I can see the birds outside the window, the delivery van arriving and pick up my coffee without spilling it down my shirt because I can't see it. Ball thinks a lot will use VR goggles, but points out the metaverse will also work with ordinary screens - and that many may prefer these or augmented reality glasses as and when the tech is up to it.\n\nThat 'as and when' is a big proviso that Ball makes. He points out the huge advances required over the current internet. This is partly because the internet is not a real-time system. It uses a packet switched protocol, breaking data up into chunks that are routed separately before reassembling them at their destination. Streaming companies can use this to deliver video because they can buffer information and, in the end, it doesn't matter if you lose continuity for a second or two. But if one member of metaverse situation drops in and out, or falls behind a couple of seconds, the whole thing is ruined. There are also the problems that many still don't have access to fibre optic internet connections, especially outside of the US (this is a very US-oriented book), which are necessary for fast enough data transfer - and even our best servers simply can't store and deliver the sheer quantity of data required at fast enough speeds to make the metaverse feel synchronous and persistent. It would require a huge amount of effort and money - and there is little evidence that the current big internet companies play well enough together to even consider making it happen.\n\nI like the way Ball gives us insights into a lot of the technical issues and the technical solutions (mostly) games manufacturers use to get around those issues (sadly, in ways that probably won’t work for the metaverse). But there is far too much focus in the book on games, other than as the engines that will provide some of the key enabling metaverse technology. Just as the internet is not mostly used for games - and most adults only play non-immersive games like Candy Crush - so the majority of the big picture metaverse would not be about gaming. Ball tells us about millions of new gamers joining the fold, but seems to forget that a lot of us who were gamers grow out of it.\n\nThis is not the only fault here. Ball has a tendency to lay out detail ploddingly - he's not a great writer. And his physics can be dodgy. He tells us light's speed is constant, as opposed to constant in a particular medium, and he thinks light changes direction in optical fibres by refraction rather than reflection. The whole metaverse thing still comes across as over-hyped. In his introduction, emphasising our moves forward in tech, Ball writes 'Throughout [the summer of 2021], competing efforts from billionaires Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos were under way to bring civilian travel to lower orbit and usher in an era of space elevators and interplanetary colonisation' - unless intended ironically, given the trivial nature of that civilian travel, the mention of space elevators rings alarm bells for promising far more than can actually physically be delivered.\n\nThe other big problem is that although Ball recognises some of the drawbacks and limitations of the metaverse, he doesn't really address these, but rather dismisses them pretty much out of hand. For instance, having mentioned the benefits of video calls during the pandemic, he claims without any evidence that a virtual meeting in the metaverse is more effective. But for me, the huge benefit of a video meeting over a phone call is seeing people's faces and body language. A set of metaverse avatars around a virtual meeting table gives no more real visual feedback than the phone call. Admittedly Ball suggests that in the future they might fully reflect your actual facial expressions, but is that likely in any reasonable timescale? And if it is, it would surely also be possible for the avatar to be AI controlled to fake facial expressions - you have no idea if what you see is real. Ball lets his enthusiasm overcome sensible logic sometimes.\n\nBy the end of the book, I could see how different Ball's vision of the metaverse as a revolutionary next-generation internet was from silly little virtual reality meetings or kids' games like Minecraft. But I also understand the vast issues that need to be overcome, which Ball outlines so well. What was missing for me was a cost/benefit analysis showing me what would be gained from making the dramatic investment and effort necessary for Ball's real metaverse to come true. I suspect we're more like to see more silo-based mini-metagalaxies that entirely miss the point.\n\nEven so, the book was an eye-opener, as Ball's picture was so different from the demos we've seen and existing environments, and it is decidedly impressive technically. As such, it's well worth a read.",
    "I read this book a week after it came out after it was recommended to me by a few people. I was pretty skeptical given the hype around the term but I was very happily surprised. Whether or not you are personally excited about the metaverse, you will come away with a much better understanding of all of the technology you use today and how different companies are trying to improve it. I also now understand why so many people are trying to build this metaverse and why we don't need to focus on whether we like Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook. I also feel like I understand how the metaverse will not just be a game, but also involved in marketing, schools, gyms and more aspects of our lives. Really recommend for those who are interested in the topic, as well as those who want to learn why others are.",
    "Overall the book which I've been reading is definetly worth reading it highlights the coming metaverse technologies that will change the world. Its incredibly detailed and easy to understand the core concepts the author is trying to explain. I'm gonna recommend this book to my friends and people with similar interests. Its a great book and I recommend it to other amazon customers aswell who would probably enjoy it.",
    "“Metaverse” it’s such a new concept that it took us decade to get a grasp of it, and will take us few more decade to perfect it. You want to fast forward few decades and ‘see’ the future? Read this book.",
    "If you are involved in the Metaverse industry in any shape or form, this book is a must read !!!"

    "A good visual for all of us as to the effects of our words!",
    "I Iike the pictures in this book the study",
    "I think this is a nice book, but it is not good for young kids. I think the scenarios mentioned in the book would be better understood by older children.",
    "I only recently realized I purchased this book for my daughter 10 years ago! She’s 16 now and has a little sister who is 4. This book was the perfect visual to explain feelings, how to treat others and set expectations for how to be treated. Wonderful illustrations and “hidden/no so hidden” message for the young and older. I am so happy we have cared for this book over the years.",
    "So perfect for my almost 8 year old. He got the concept right away, asks me to read it to him often and now we can talk about how full each of our buckets are.",
    "Having two boys at home they say some pretty out of the normal things; well my oldest came home calling his brother a bucketdipper and well my mind went somewhere else and at that point of course I had to research where this word came from ... and this is why I ordered this book. My oldest who is in Kindergarten was read this book in class and was taught that when saying or doing something not so nice thet was \"bucket dipping\" which hence the term \"bucketdipper.\" Now there are many reasons thet someone can be a bucketdipper the book goes on to show many examples. The example I found extremely useful for children to understand which was when someone is hurt they hurt others; I loved this exampl of a bucketdipper. When someone is a bucketdipper they not only dip into another bucket but they also dip into their own hence not really helping themselves by choosing to be men or have a bad attitude. Now the point is to be a bucket filler the bucket fillers when filling others buckets also fill their own as it feels good to help others feel good. This book allows children to self reflect and think about how to not only earn stickers or checks for their own end reward but how to help others most importantly and feeling good about it as a reward in itself. I highly recommend the collection of these books as it is a great lesson for adults and children alike anyone can benefit from self reflection at any age.",
    "M daughter loved this book. She always ask to read it for school! She actually learned about showing compassion and filling others buckets up.",
    "This is a great book for adults as well as children.",
    "I bought this book for my Year 2 class at school after some of the girls were falling out with each other too easily. We have read this a few times and also created a \"class bucket\" - the children really engaged well with the story and two weeks have now passed without any falling out at all! Long may it continue!\n\nThe children are also in the habit of talking about \"their buckets\" and have learnt that they can increase someone's else happiness.",
    "This book is not quite up to what I needed, too American. Better book is Have you filled a bucket today, which I used for a school assembly 350 children it went down a treat!",
    "One of my favourite books that really make children think about empathy and sympathy. I read this to my grade 1 class and the students really enjoyed it. The idea of a bucket of feelings really resonated with them.",
    "My kids and I really enjoy this book. It help explains a difficult concept to children. And, it helps me to get my little children to do things that they don't always want to do (e.g. help their little brother, skype with their grandparents, tidy their toys, etc.).",
    "Loved this book, as did 5 and 6 year olds. Very simple concept and they refer to it daily. It helped make them more conscious of the impact of their behaviour on others."

    "This book review will begin with an executive summary and for those who desire more information or the specifics of details mentioned; a very detailed analysis of this book follows the executive summary.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis book was read from cover to cover and detailed notes kept throughout. Buy this book only to prepare to take the PMP exam, besides this advice there is no sane or justifiable reason to buy this book. If you have this book and have successfully obtained the PMP, then consider its use as a door stop or place in the trash. Do not be a party to spreading the ineffective and deficient content of this book to some poor unsuspecting and aspiring project manager.\n\nThis book is written similar to a technical manual which makes it nearly impossible to read with the hopes of gleaning useful information. I found it difficult to believe that it was not created with the express intent of inhibiting the clear and easy flow information and knowledge. That this book has essentially spawned an industry of other books, test banks, exam preparation seminars, etc. to assist you in passing the PMP. The PMP exam prep industry is a testimony to the inane structure and content of this book.\n\nThe areas which stood out as this book’s principal failures include change management advice, defining a project, Agile, scope and charter advice, reserves, scheduling, project plans, risks, project status and the Project standard. The largest area of project management failure in this book concerns project scope. This book fails to communicate a clear message as to how scope is developed and once developed what is necessary for the project manager to execute the project based on defined scope. You will read in this book that the project charter authorizes the project manager to apply resources to projects (p. 75), but on page 154 you will read that the project scope statement is the detailed description of project scope and the project charter is not because the project charter only contains high level detail.\nThe PMBOK is confused. A project must never start execution until all scope is identified and the PMBOK gives contradictory guidance. The PMBOK gives project managers permission to apply resources to projects based on a charter, but the charter is described as a “high level” document on page 154. The PMBOK never officially and clearly defines the point at which project scope is defined. A project with undefined scope is not a project. This book is full of similar confusing and bad advice. Do not buy this book to learn project management, it will give you confusing direction and bad advice. End of executive summary.\n\nNow the details:\nContinuing with the scope issues in this book is the development of scope. Page 161 mentions the “100 percent rule” and states: “The total work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is sometimes called the 100 percent rule.” This PMBOK sentence is utter non-sense. Look at it again closely. The sentence suggests that the work you planned at its lowest levels will roll up to higher levels. Tell me, how does this process ensure, as the sentence states, that no work is “left out?” Simply examining project work that is detailed to its lower levels will not inform a project manager that work is missing. I’ll not explain how this process should occur and leave it to the project management geniuses’ listed in this book to figure it out (appendix X12-Contributors and Reviewers-p. 651). That they miss this obvious check every project must perform is your first indication of a highly defective book. I would be embarrassed and ashamed to have my name associated with this book.\n\nOn page 316 is the guidance “to ensure that each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities.” Really? Who does this? You, the project manager? The PMBOK does not describe who makes these suggested assignments or how this should occur. The PMBOK defines “Mega Projects” as those $1 Billion or more (p. 11). OK let’s try to apply the advice of the PMBOK. You are the project manager of a Mega Project which has a budget of $3 Billion. A project of this size during peak execution will have many hundreds of work packages open and executing each month. Do you the project manager have enough time in the day to assign work package owners ensuring they have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities for the many hundreds of work packages each month? (p. 316). This PMBOK advice is absurd and the PMBOK has no concept of work authorization, command or project control. Again, I will not explain how this process actually functions on large to very large projects. Again, we have in the PMBOK a failure to offer useable advice and guidance to project managers.\n\nThis is enough for scope, charter and project organization issues and my notes of remaining deficiencies in this section could go on for many more pages.\n\nThe suggestions and guidance given for project changes are abysmal. A consistent theme throughout this book is that changes must be accompanied with appropriate approvals and changes (p. 120). This advice may sound good, but beware. This vague and cavalier approach to project changes and in particular “baseline changes” is again bad advice. The PMBOK gives the incorrect impression that project baselines (cost and schedule) can be changed at will so long as it is accompanied with approvals. NO! Baseline cost and schedule do not routinely change and the existence of an approved change form does not make routine Baseline changes acceptable. What is clear is the PMBOK has no clue regarding the types and levels of changes and the geniuses’ (appendix X12-Contributors and Reviewers-p. 651) likewise have no idea what types of changes are routine and what changes are rare.\n\nOne last example of the absurdities of project change in the PMBOK: “Approved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequence, schedule dates, resource requirements, and/or analysis of risk response alternatives.” (p. 115). Let’s focus on the part of the sentence “schedule dates.” What are schedule dates? Does this include: Actual Start, Actual Finish, Forecast Start, Forecast Finish, Baseline Start or Baseline Finish? In true PMBOK vagueness they do not specify. But, it is absolutely ridiculous to consider processing an approved change form to change schedule: Actual Start, Actual Finish, Forecast Start and Forecast Finish days. Let’s do this again, you are the project manager of a $ 3 Billion project with hundreds and hundreds of work packages open each month and in the project schedule. A properly statused project will review and revise as necessary all uncompleted work package actual and forecast dates. This ensures an accurate and up-to-date critical path. It is the height of stupidity to consider creating, processing and signing untold hundreds of change forms each month to change project actual and forecast dates. This is just one example of many, many others that could also be exposed.\n\nIt is astounding that the PMBOK’s definition of a project (p. 4) fails to mention that a project must have a budget. This deficient definition continues on page 13 (Table 1-2) where projects are not required to have defined scope and schedule requirements (Period of Performance). Making it worse, on page 13, scope is defined as being “progressively elaborated.” Scope described as progressively elaborated is scope which is undefined and this means the project has no clear definition of what constitutes the project. This poor advice is likely related to definitions used for Agile “projects” which do not have defined scope. Page 131 describes Agile or “adaptative” projects as an effort whose “scope is defined and approved for each iteration.” (p. 131). Any project effort in which scope is not defined at the beginning and when the baseline is set, is not a project. Hence, Agile is not a project. A project must have a defined scope, period of performance and budget all of which must be defined prior to execution. Because the PMBOK has chosen to adopt Agile efforts, it has compromised the definition of a project. But selling Agile books and Agile certifications is good business.\n\nIf you have read this far, congratulations. I grow weary of documenting this highly deficient book. There could be additional pages documents its deficiencies in its focus on internal projects to the exclusion of external projects, scheduling inaccuracies, incorrect Earned Value information, some of the worst project risk advice and equally poor advice on how to status a project.\n\nOne last topic. Let’s examine “The Standard for Project Management - ANSI/PMI 99-001-2017 which starts on page 539. The introduction states this standard “serves as the foundation and framework for A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide).” Well as the foundation, this standard ought to be quite solid and clear, however it is just as poorly written as the PMBOK. What I noticed is this “Standard for Project Management” has a complete absence of “must” and “shall” statements. I call this “Standard” which is not a “Standard.” Because it is absent “must” and/or “shall” statements, this standard essentially requires nothing, which then means the PMBOK is built on a “toothless” and empty standard.\n\nTo make matters worse the PMBOK conflicts with the Standard upon which it is supposed to serve as its foundation (p. 539). The PMBOK describes Risk Management in section 11 beginning on page 395. On page 397 the reader is introduced to the concept of “positive risks”, an absurd phraseology when “opportunities” is the industry standard. However, the PMI Standard on page 586 does not introduce or define “positive risks.” The PMBOK is by definition not compliant to its own standard for creating terms and concepts that do not exist in the Standard. But then again, the PMI Standard is toothless and a “Standard” which sets no “Standards.”",
    "Informative book covering the fundamentals of project management. This Book explains the processes and how they are implemented to effectively manage any project.",
    "I'm not sure that I understand the complaints over the readability of the pages of this book. After reading the other reviews, I went to look at the copy that a coworker had, and it looked fine. I went ahead and ordered, and my copy received looks fine as well. If you look really, really hard, you can see the anti-counterfeiting copy on the page, but I doubt that I would have noticed it if I hadn't known about it. That said, I'm already sorry that I didn't get the electronic version, it would be much easier to read as far as not needing room for a big book opened in front of me, not to mention the ease of searching. Since my work reimbursed me for this copy, I may foot the bill for the electronic version for myself. Regular books seem so dated to me, I feel like it should be stored next to my checkbook, my stamps, and a corded phone.",
    "I just received this book in the mail yesterday and I can 100% validate that this copy is easily readable and the concept is straightforward. I can't speak for those who had terrible copies and copyright printed papers, but I can definitely vouch for the copy I received to be almost perfect in condition and pages were almost purely white, not the grayscale tint some mentioned. As for the knowledge, I can't speak on the general guidance just yet as I have just started getting into it and will take some time diving deeper into it as I progress my studies, but as many have mentioned, it's not a novel. It's a guide and therefore there are some areas where concepts are mentioned a little early in one section and then revisited later on in the book, causing you to go back and re-administer your learning. I recommend you use this \"guide\" along with training material from a solid source online like Joseph Phillips. This will help eliminate trying to read it all the way through and only focus on certain sections that are being covered at the moment to get full utilization from the book. As for now, I will give it 5 stars as I see absolutely nothing wrong with the content, condition, clarity, visibility, and knowledge of the book. I'll update if I notice anything not worthy.",
    "Prior to purchasing the downloadable Kindle version of the PMBOK 6th edition ebook I saw numerous negative reviews and it made me pause and do more research before ordering. I downloaded the free sample and did all my research. The sample was fully functional and so I was able to test all the Kindle features. I tested taking notes, highlighting, bookmarking, searching, zooming in on charts and graphs, and general readability. I did all this on my iPad. I had zero issues and recommend the downloadable version to anyone considering a digital copy of the book.",
    "This has only just arrived but I was concerned by some earlier reviews that said the book is difficult to read. Yes it is printed on grey paper but it is very clear, the diagrams are all in white and are equally clear. I have attached a diagram from the book which is of the same quality as all of them. Maybe the reviews were of a previous edition, or a reprint has taken place. Anyway, I am pleased with it.",
    "Students - stick to the PDFs on your kindles. That's less of a pain.\nAs usual with these \"security features\" that \"look good on paper\", they only serve to annoy legal, paying customers, and are absolutely no problem for people that want to make an illegal copy. Especially given that perfectly clean DRM free PDFs are easy to come by - and all interested parties pay for membership of PMI anyway (and get a legal version with their membership).\nWhat a fail!\nI paid for the printed version for the ease of reading. I have not received that.\nP.S. the scanner that I have used cost me 25gbp new (on amazon, verified purchase), and it is in no way \"high end\".",
    "Don't buy this book, very poor quality of Book. Not properly binded and images and diagrams are also fuzzy overall in the book. Beeing from a printing background I can guarantee these books are scrap or bad copies which is sold in half price due to low printing standards and quality.",
    "This is a great reference books for CPAM and PMP learning/examinations. Have dropped a star due to the wafer thin pages and print that is sometimes difficult to read (as other reviews have rightly highlighted!). For the exams, I would recommend practice exam question books, which are a plenty on Amazon!",
    "Does exactly what it says, its the latest version of the PMBOK. The reason for leaving the review is that I saw a number of one star reviews saying they struggled to read the pages due to them being on grey paper (an anti-copying measure). The pages and type are crystal clear on my copy which I've read under a variety of lights, so I don't know what's happened to other people's copies. Or eyes...."

    "This book and the second volume published by the same author are must-read before a system design interview. There is so much material about system design online (videos, courses, ..) that you need to narrow it down so that you are not lost and confused. These two books will help you achieve this goal. What I did not like is that each chapter has a different format; some present first the APIs, some others the data schema, some others omit them and go directly to the high level design. This is a bit confusing when you want to clear things in your head and prepare for the actual interview. So, you need to do some extra work after you read these two books.",
    "As a software engineer you must know how to design different systems. What things to consider or define requirements clearly? That book will guide through various design principles and examples",
    "Great book - new (not used) copy slightly damaged on delivery.",
    "The book is pretty good. It’s easy to read. There are lots of design diagrams. If you are a visual person, you will love the book. It helped me pass the system design round at FANG.\n\nI read the book twice and take notes. I read all the reference materials mentioned in the book. Reading those extra materials help me a lot with topics I’m not familiar with.\n\nHighlights:\n+ The book has a good set of questions.\n+ Lots of diagrams and clear explanation.\n+ You will learn something new by reading the book regardless of your experience.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- I wish the reference links are footnotes instead of being at the end of chapters. That way, it’s more accessible.\n- Some topics are not talked about too much like security and stream processing.\n- It’s tailored towards junior and semi-senior engineers. Some chapters are not deep enough. For example, I wish the author would talk more about feed ranking and caching in the designing news feed chapter.\n\nOverall, it’s a masterpiece in system design books. However, no book can cover everything in system design. No one knows every system. Here are some of my other recommendations:\n\n-- designing data-intensive applications. Highly recommended.\n-- system design primer github repo. Highly recommended free resource.\n-- Leetcode discussion forum about system designs.\n-- Grokking the system interview course. This is an ok resource but not very deep.\n-- Various youtube channels. I like channels like Tushar Roy, System Design Interview, Success in Tech, etc. There are a lot more but I found them most useful for senior engineer positions.\n-- Various tech blogs: Facebook, Netflix, Uber, AirBnb, etc. Those tech blogs are extremely valuable to help us understand real-life systems.\n-- highscalability website. The website contains lots of real world systems.\n-- InfoQ youtube channel. Many tech companies talk about how they scale their systems at infoQ. I find sometimes it’s quite hard to find useful videos on google but when I narrow down it to a specific channel, it’s much easier to find. For example, I found a lot of useful tech talks about uber there. It’s invaluable when I interviewed there.",
    "you get what you pay for- probably the authors first book- he didnt use an editor- but it explains topics well and i learned things from this book. i am glad i bought it. just keep in mind its written by an engineer, not a teacher, and that shows",
    "Put together in an order that helps explain the process, no big jargon , simple for knowledge intake. Will read again and again.",
    "I was a bit disappointed while reading \"Design a chat system\" chapter. It is described only at high level, I believe there's a lot of problems left undiscussed. But this chapter is after about 70% of the book, everything before was deep enough. Text references instead of links is a great drawback too, that can be easily fixed.",
    "It is the best book that discusses the system design so far!\nI read a few posts from other people, and I think those comments do not really reflect the author's true intent. The author was trying to provide a generic way of how to approach the design issues and provided some classic design patterns. The book is very well organized. In the first few chapters, it tells you the common ways to scale the system and then gradually dive into deeper to show some fundamental concepts and practical ways of how a distributed system should be built. For example, Consistent Hashing is the foundation and has been used so many places, Alex explained very well. Then he discussed how to efficiently compare the nodes and how to detect the temp and permanent failures and recover from the failure. Yes, some of the content can be considered as \"borrowed\" from the paper, but Alex put them together in a very nice and easy way and save you a lot of questions and time. I read the original paper and still get inspired by the book. Another example is the Youtube chapter, Alex used some concepts from facebook paper. But we have to appreciate that he understood the content and put into such an easy way that you don’t need to spend a day to read facebook paper and still only 60% understanding.\nYou also need to think of the first eight chapters are the building blocks of the distributed system, and they are the real challenges. Maybe in no interviews, people will ask the same questions, but these technics are really needed for you to build a good distributed system. For example, there is no global clock in the distributed system; then Twitter came up a Snowflake unique ID with the time concept in it. For example, the unique ID becomes the foundation of generating the short URL and newsfeed. For example, the Merkle tree helps you efficiently compare the difference between the nodes.\nYes, there are some chapters that seem to be oversimplified, such as Google drive chapter, but overall the book covered a lot of patterns that require building the distributed system.\nA suggestion for Alex, organized the book into two sections, the common challenges and practical patterns for the distributed system, then dive into the interview questions.\nGreat effort, I will give my 5 stars!",
    "The book is just fine if you have never read any other book on the subject. Very good intro on how to approach a system design interview but that is all the value.\n\nThe content of the book is not very well written in my opinion, and it not very coherent. it looks like a collecion of blog posts and on most problems it presents it just guides the reader to \"a solution\" without examining the problem at hand at (any) depth...it jsut presents a solution. An unsuspected reader may think that this problem is solved like that, which is not exactly the point.\n\nThe printing quality is really bad (if you are interested in having good books). the images are dim, the text has different intensity on every page (bad printing on cheap paper).\n\nThe diversity of subjects is OK but it is also what makes it incoherent. Some of them are not system design at all..\nOverall I do not think it worths its money at all.",
    "I conduct system design interviews myself. The uses cases covered in the book are impressive however the actual design itself is mediocre most of the times. There is no creativity and it falls short in discussing the various tradeoffs in design decisions.\n\nIt also totally lacks a dive deep on key aspects of the design. For example, design a youtube lacks dive deep on challenges we may face while building the transcoding subsystem.\n\nI would recommend candidates to use this book as a 'syllabus indicator' and supplement their study with other materials freely available on the net and also some good video tutorials on youtube.",
    "In the first few chapters, author covers important steps one should follow during the system design interview. Nothing groundbreaking there, but a reminder to be more interactive and to make your thinking process more visible to the interviewer.\nFollowing chapters investigate, interesting system design problems one by one. Problems covered are from rate limiter, consistent hashing, unique id generation and key value store etc. I thought initial chapters were written well but towards the end where author was trying to cover ‘Design Youtube’ or ‘Design Google Drive’ , it kind of lost its coherence a bit. The diagrams were not properly explained. New concepts were introduced without any proper explanation. Overall, the book is ok, but I wish author has put bit more technical rigor in analyzing and explaining. One major disappointment, for a book of this technical nature I was expecting a proper bibliography which wasn’t there.",
    "This book was not worth my money or time. Overall, it's absolutely basic as far the content and solutions are concerned. Many paragraphs are outright useless. They don't just lack depths, they lack even a basic explanation and are just content-less fillers. The only somewhat helpful thing some of them contain are references to some blog post or another.\nIn regards to language and layout, this book is just badly written, badly edited and filled with errors.\n\nI would not recommend this book at all. It seems to be nothing more than a hastily and amateurishly put together cash-grab. Someone who is very new to tech might find some value in this book, but then again, doing a System Design Interview is not usually expected from someone who is new to tech and what they might learn from this book is too basic to be of real use anyway...",
    "Great foundation for system designs. Thanks to this book, I was able to answer correctly several system design follow up questions at Google and Meta."

    "Moved to another state, all alone, needed to make friends and be able to speak to a variety of ppl, this little book helped",
    "Book was written 20 years ago so some of this is outdated. Overall good book with enough good tips and reminders for anyone that feels awkward in social settings or sales.",
    "I am just a over half way done and find this book pretty helpful. I am making a small collection of what works for me in my current work as I move onward and upward. I work as a server in a restaurant while my wife is finishing up school before we move. Asking the tables if I may take a moment before I tell them the special has shot my specials sales up. giving them a full figured thank you has cracked open even the hardest of customer. I have found this book to be very helpful with the micro moments I have with people as my place of work is extremely fast. I bite the leather between every door step. It may be a few hundred more then your 60 but that is the nature of my beast. I am excited to use a few more of the books content when I go into sales in the future after our big move to CO.\nI am also finding this book helpful in my hobby. I enjoy writing novels but sometimes fall flat in the conversation of my characters. I wanted to read something like this to assist in that problem of mine. I have one (pretty bad) starter book on amazon as well. The book covers restaurant theft in a novel format to not just explain how its performed but give a light situation of when the opportunity generally comes up. My current job and my characters in this book as well as a basic re-write of the last but expanded on are the underbelly of the work force. Write what you know as the old adage goes which applies for Leil and myself.\nWhich brings me to my one and only question. Do you have any suggestions or tips for working with the underbelly of our world, the below middle class group of people? A short list of tip numbers to look out for in this current works or a suggestion for my next book to read would be wonderful. \"How to Talk to Anyone\" has many wonderful stories which mainly put your mental image in that 3000 person large companies and parties with 5 people where the average income is six figures. Sometimes you have to work through the dregs before you can claw your way to a group of people that are more receptive to more than half of these tips you have covered. I'll just say I am forced to talk about weather a lot.\n\nThank you for the book. I know how hard it is to put one together and appreciate your efforts.",
    "Great book learned alot of different ways to communicate been using them as I read and really look forward to what this new knowledge will bring me",
    "By using real life examples makes this an easy read yet also a memorable Book.",
    "It starts off with solid advice that's generally applicable, but the further you get into the book the more elitist and cynical it becomes. Because of my particular job, I’ve interacted with several multi-millionaires. However, they are all self-made construction related contractors so they’re nothing like the elite described in this book. Most of them are all friendly, down-to-earth guys who earned their money by dealing with normal people.\n\nThat makes me think the later advice in this book is for dealing with truly old money. It’s so weird that it comes across as a caricature from my perspective because it feels like the kind of stuff I read in fantasy novels where the nobility are all ultra finicky about social rules with a hair trigger nose-in-the-air attitude. If that's really how people at that level of wealth and connection are, I'll pass.",
    "There is nothing dated about this book -- if anything, the lessons are more valuable as we all become more socially awkward from overreliance on digital communication. Leslie is a genius, and she communicates convincingly and clearly.\n\nI learned a lot! I wish I found her sooner.",
    "Unbeknown to me I already owned essentially the same book by Leil, called \"talking the winner's way.\" a lot of identical tips but I like 92 tricks better (you don't need both). If you're interested enough to read about communication, you've probably noticed people who do well in social settings and were wondering how to emulate them. Some interesting ideas here that will help you do that if you keep brushing up on these strategies. Its not that anything is particularly groundbreaking, but the ideas are useful and its bringing these strategies to awareness (instead of being subconscious) that makes it more likely to be effective. But if you're a shy or unsure person like myself, I think if you're really to get anything out of this book, you've really got to be willing to take some risks and actually want to put these ideas into action, as awkward as it may feel at the start, and thats something that is out of the author's control; you have to really want to work at being more effective at being a \"natural\" communicator.\n\nI gave this fewer stars mainly because I get annoyed with the writing, it errors on the side of condescending drivel (to me), but she gets her point across and thats the important thing, even if it does involve bizarre narrative, a slew of outdated adjectives, and plenty of cliches (which she specifically warns against using, without heeding herself). Also gave it fewer stars because I didn't expect it to be so much the same as her other book; kind of feel ripped off. Also, as with any \"tricks,\" in the wrong hands they're totally insincere; anyone who does these communication tricks without being genuine will only come across as annoying. Certain aspects of this book seem to condone learning the skills to ruthlessly pursue your own agenda, and that was also something that annoyed me. Sometimes it really does feel like this book is just giving you ways of tricking people into liking you, and while that may be a part of life, its better to try to work at sincerity and gratitude. If you practice better communication skills with those values in place, you're likely to both do better and feel better.\n\nAll said and done, If you really want to build relationships and communicate better for the simple sake of improving the skill, enhancing your relationships, and the ability to feel comfortable in social situations, reading about it is a good place to start and actively practicing is even better. This book will give you ideas to carry with you when mingling events arise.",
    "Die Autorin ist eine sicherlich total flippige und interessante Person.\n\nSie fällt auf, und will im Mittelpunkt stehen.\n\nDas ist nicht, was ich will.\n\nIch bin eher ein Denker. Und darum scheiter ich hin- und wieder im beruflichen Kontext,\nweil ich eine Sache gut durchdacht habe, aber meinen Lösungsvorschlag nicht passend\nkommuniziere.\n\nEs wäre ein sinnloses Theaterspiel würde ich die im Buch genanten Hinweise umsetzen.\n\nDie meisten Ratschläge des Buches sind nicht wissenschaftlich belegt.\n\nEs geht in dem Buch eher darum \"Wie spiele ich mich als Person in den Mittelpunkt?\". Sorry,\ndas ist nicht mein Anliegen.\n\nIch frage mich warum das Buch so gute Bewertungen hat.",
    "Not sure. I have read so many of these books. When I’m high, I can talk to anyone!",
    "Quite manipulative to be honest, indulged into it and found out that the shortcut of social relations is equivalent to perfecting the superficial facade in meeting acquaintances.\n\nThis yields a short term high in confidence and pride (after trials and errors in implementing them) but you can't get further than that in building any form of relationships(career, friendship, romance) that would last or even work in the long term.",
    "There are a lot of good techniques in here that make a lot of sense and can be used straight away. Most are relatively short and easy to dip in and out of. I appreciate that the purpose of the book is most likely just that...a book of tips and tricks, but the book could be so much more if there was a little more context behind it. A lot of really good advice comes across as very superficial, with a focus on making yourself more likeable to the 'big players', rather than to improving and creating more meaningful relationships in general. The book is great as a reference for some handy hints and tips, but amongst all the references to glass ceilings and tigers, st times you feel like you're just learning ways to climb the corporate ladder and win the rat race, rather than connect with people in a more meaningful way and express yourself more effectively. It seemed to me that it was very easy to lose sight of why better relationships are important, and there was a strong focus on just trying to impress powerful people (for example if a CEO spills a drink over you it should be ignored and never mentioned but if a friend takes too long to write down an address given by an important client you shouldn't risk introducing them to any 'big players' again). The context and meaning behind the tricks are the glue that help them to flow together, and I think that there would be a lot of scope to include more detail on how to use these techniques to better connect with people and express yourself better.",
    "Awful book, mostly aimed at business. Each point is accompanied by a far-fetched story about a friend. Maybe some insights, but I doubt it."

    "A MUST READ book for athletes. I was a competitive swimmer K-College, triathlete for 30 + years and a swim and triathlon coach for over 20 years. Nice to read a book that is so relatable to me, Steve's Perspective and stories he shares as both athlete and coach. I am also a fan of both his podcasts Science of running and the Growth EQ where he discusses many of the concepts in his book. Doing \"hard\" things is relative to each person and, has helped me develop mental confidence in my sport and in life and any experienced athlete will gain so much perspective from reading this book. - Wendy Mader",
    "Magness does an excellent job of compiling anecdotes and research to redefine how we look at toughness. By examining a more holistic approach to being tough, the yelling coaching style of \"do it or else\" is now on life support. Magness argues that giving kids/athletes/people the tools to be successful and support in their journey develops autonomy which is can be accessed at any time...not just when the coach is there to get it out of them. Like a job, we need to provide people with tools to allow them to do their jobs, not just stand over them like a micromanaging boss telling them what to do.\n\nA wonderful book. A must have for any coach interested in helping create better humans, not just better athletes.",
    "Steve Magness takes us on a journey toward redefining “toughness”. This is an interesting, science based examination of the concept of “toughness”. “Old School” tells us to persevere and push through. If you don’t, you are weak. Having coached high school athletes for 30+ years, this never rang true for me. Magness offers a different perspective that rings true to my personal experience.\n\nOne passage, near the end of the book, encapsulates his thinking:\n\n“We’re able to make meaning out of struggle, out of suffering. Meaning is the glue that holds our minds together, allowing us to both respond and recover. It stalls the jump from difficulty to complete despair, from fear and anxiety to full-blown freak out.”\n\nA solid read",
    "This book is excellent! Steve Magnus does a wonderful job of weaving his personal experiences as a coach of world class athletes and whistle blower with the latest research and scientific data to weave an inspiring and coherent narrative on the value of doing hard things. You may be surprised to learn that toughness is not what we have traditionally believed it to be. Do Hard Things provides significant insight into how we should navigate the challenges of the modern era and gain satisfaction from rising to meet those challenges. I highly recommend this book!",
    "Highly recommended!! This book strikes a perfect balance between Magness' personal experience as narrative throughline and then elevated with thorough research that is clearly explained.\nIt offers perspectives that can help coaches, parents, athletes, creatives or really anyone who strives. But, what I love most about it is that it reminds you of how much you actually love doing hard things, one might call it suffering and thus one might wonder why do/would I do that to myself. Magness doesn't tell us why but rather he helps us understand why and also made me realize why the process of doing hard things is more rewarding than having done them. He also offers tools that help you remember that the next time you find yourself wondering- do I really want to do this?",
    "As a coach, husband and father there were so many takeaways from this book that I will be applying to all of those roles that I play in my life.\n\nWhat I enjoy about Steve Magness' writing is that while rooted in research-backed science it is easily digestible and applicable to everyday life.\n\nIt was a quick, enjoyable but very impactful read and I recommend it to everyone.",
    "This is a fantastic book. Steve has given a lot of consideration into writing the main ideas, one of which is to genuinely challenge yourself.",
    "Do Hard Things was a thought provoking winner! Nothing hard about it. The concept that toughness is about intrinsic control of your reaction to a variety of challenges and opportunities made so much sense. I coach High School Cross Country and the insights Steve Magness provides are invaluable in creating and supporting the team culture we want.",

    "In Do Hard Things, Steve combines interesting science-backed research with his own personal in-the-trenches experience to provide an actionable (and highly practical) guide on how to develop real toughness and inner confidence. I loved the structure of the book and the toughness maxims smattered throughout. I’ve been a huge fan of Steve’s work for years. His books, podcasts, and blog posts have transformed me as a writer, an athlete, and has helped make me an overall, happier person.I couldn’t wait for this book to hit the shelves and can say with full confidence that this is Steve's best work yet. I cannot recommend Do Hard Things enough (+ also can’t wait to read it again)!",
    "A great overview or review of what our concepts of toughness are. Steve’s research and practical easily understood explanations make you reconsider what you think toughness is and how it applies to your life.",

It was a brew of his life, his lessons, his winning trait habits, his losing trait habits, and a bunch of punches at our ego. He made this book with such simplicity and repetition. My high school teachers would always want me to find the meaning behind literary devices and I always hated it and found it useless. But in this book i see how those devices helped me expand my little brain. As in this book repetition is used plenty of times, at first i thought it was because of writing space how I use to do. But He was just making sure we got the point he was giving us. The repetition comes from a place of importance and wanting to make clear.",

    "The simple premise of the book is pretty straight forward: it is only after we stop trying to do everything and stop saying yes to everyone, that we can direct our energy to the few things that really matter to us, the essentials.\n\nIt is about priority, the discipline pursuit of less, about getting the right things done, and doing them mindfully and wholesomely. And everything else become fairly insignificant.\n\nI must admit that while reading the early chapters I was at first skeptical of this book, as its simple message is just another minimalism mantra that I’ve already read in several books. But as I read on, I soon realize that McKeown relies more on data and scientific findings rather than just the general zen feeling of the outcome (which have profoundly changed my life nonetheless). And the more the book progresses the more practical it gets, which starts with the concept of trade-offs.\n\nIn a perfect world we can easily eliminate all of the non-essentials. But we don’t live in a perfect world, and instead in every decision that we make we will more likely to face trade-offs. As McKeown explains, “by definition, a trade-off involves two things we want. Do you want more pay or more vacation time? Do you want to finish this next e-mail or be on time to your meeting? Do you want it done faster or better?” “Obviously”, McKeown continues, “when faced with the choice between two things we want, the preferred answer is yes to both. But as much as we’d like to, we simply cannot have it all.”\n\nSo yes, most of the time we have to choose. And this just happens to be the core specialty of this book: the intricate process of decision making.\n\nThe book provides us with the scientific and psychological researches about the underlying determinants behind our decision making process - such as learned helplessness, Pareto Principle, the Power Law theory, sunk-cost bias, or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s flow - and guide us to the process of (re)gaining control over our options.\n\nIt then teaches us several decision making skills, such as to look at information like a journalist (by following a lead, by listening to what is not being said, by finding the essence of the information), or the 90 Percent Rule (if it’s not a hell yeah, then it’s a no - only the 90% mark out of 100% will do), or decluttering methods that would make Marie Kondo blushed, or simple methods like clarifying our purpose so that it’s changed from pretty clear to really clear.\n\nIt then analyzes some crucial factors of decision making such as the power of sleep, with the short chapter on sleep provides a more compacted findings than the 2 books on sleep that I’ve read. The fact that this book put the science of sleep into the overall context of Essentialism makes it relatively more actionable that Shawn Stevenson’s and Ariana Huffington’s excellent stand alone book on the subject.\n\nFor example, to succeed at something we need to put 10,000 hours of hard work on it (a theory founded by K. Anders Ericsson by studying violinists, and popularised by Malcolm Gladwell). But this book provides the 2nd part of the study that was rarely highlighted: that the very best violinists actually sleep an average of 8.6 hours. It was sleep that gave them the edge.\n\nMoreover, the book also provides so many tools for the execution, including the very useful “buffer” theory and the “slowest hiker” efficiency, that ensure our execution can be efficient and precise. It also highlighted the importance of routines to switch our task to Basal Ganglia part of the brain and make it automatic and thus freeing up our minds (akin to Charles Duhigg's Power of Habits), and a sub-chapter on triggers that would make Marshall Goldsmith proud.\n\nThe book also provides an abundance of many more examples from various walks of life, with examples from the morning routines of some of the most successful people, to the investment decisions of Warren Buffett (whom owes 90% of his wealth only from 10 investments), what Stephen R. Covey did for his daughter (that leaves a profound inspiration for my parenting style), how Britain and Norway handle their oil proceeds differently, to what Nelson Mandela did in his 27 years in prison (eliminating everything non-essential including his resentment to work on 1 clear goal: to eliminate apartheid in South Africa), or how the right NO spoken at the right time can change the course of history (such as the bus incident with Rosa Parks).\n\nNeurologically speaking our attention span, willpower, and cognitive bandwidth are not unlimited. Hence, it is only by focusing on the essentials that we can produce deep work, flows, and other things that lead to extraordinary performances. In fact, one of the biggest differences between the average person and billionaires and top athletes is that they prioritize their time and effort differently. And this book gives us the clarity on how to do them.",
    "Wow. I got this book on the enthusiastic recommendation of a colleague. This is a great read both as a book and an audible. I got both. I never felt at home as a minimalist and I didn’t want to be a maximalist anymore. Essentialism is just the ticket. I felt like this book spoke to me. The chapters are broken into easy to digest topics with easily relatable stories and analogies. Bottom line it is a great book - the best book on this subject that I have encountered. If you are looking for more life satisfaction and the ability to discern what a good life looks like for yourself this book has the tools and roadmap to achieve this.",
    "Life is complicated. Life is full of responsibilities and opportunities, planned duties and serendipitous possibilities. There is so much we could do, but so little we can do. Many of us battle our whole lives to focus on those few, significant items that we should do must do, and yet so few of us ever feel like we are even nearly succeeding.\n\nHelp is here in the form of Greg McKeown’s book Essentialism. While it is not a perfect book, and while it benefits tremendously from adding a good dose of Christian thinking, it is one of the most helpful I’ve read on that constant battle to focus my time and energy on the right things.\n\nMcKeown believes in what he calls Essentialism and describes the basic value proposition in this way: “only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.” The Essentialist pursues fewer but better opportunities and is rigidly disciplined in rejecting the many to devote himself to the few. It is “not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done.”\n\nThe way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.\n\nNow that sounds good! That sounds like what we all want—a clear design to our lives that simplifies decision-making and amplifies each of the opportunities we pursue.\n\nMcKeown leads the reader to Essentialism in four parts:\n\nEssence. He begins by looking to the essence of Essentialism and the realities that make Essentialism a necessary but difficult practice today.\n\nExplore. Here he describes the way an Essentialist needs to think so he can pursue the highest possible contribution toward the best goals.\n\nEliminate. Having determined the best goals, the Essentialist now needs to begin eliminating anything that will compete with the pursuit of those goals. “It’s not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts don’t make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively eliminate those that do not.”\n\nExecute. And then comes the heart of it all—living in such a way that you now execute on those few goals, and continuing to follow the discipline of it.\n\nMcKeown promises his book “will teach you a method for being more efficient, productive, and effective in both personal and professional realms. It will teach you a systematic way to discern what is important, eliminate what is not, and make doing the essential as effortless as possible. In short, it will teach you how to apply the disciplined pursuit of less to every area of your life.”\n\nAnd I think it can do that. It is chock-full of excellent insights and quoteable phrases. It is the kind of book you can use to implement systems in your life, or the kind of book you can plunder for its big and important ideas.\n\nYet the Christian reader will want to read it with some discernment. This is a book that benefits from an infusion of the biblical ethos. As the book reaches its end, McKeown expands Essentialism to all of life and here he stops quoting business gurus and begins quoting religious gurus; the last chapter is easily the weakest and one that can be skipped without any great loss.\n\nReading the book through a Christian lens improves it significantly. McKeown writes about people who always say “yes” and are afraid to say “no.” That sounds like a classic diagnosis of fear of man, a person so motivated by the praise of man that he takes on too much and says no to too little so he can win the praise of other people.\n\nNot only that, but God has a way of diverting us from what we believe are our most important tasks. He diverts us to tasks he determines are even more important, and a too-rigid adherence to Essentialism may keep a Christian from allowing and embracing those divine interruptions. Read the gospels and the book of Acts and you will see how Jesus and the Apostles were extremely focused, but also very willing to depart from their plans. Implementing Essentialism too rigidly may just lead to a self-centered life rather than a life of service to others.\n\nReading through that Christian lens also allows us to see that Essentialism can be a means through which we honor and glorify God. It propels us to consider where God has specially gifted and equipped us to serve him and his people. Again, “Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.” The principles of Essentialism, read and applied through the Bible, will help us understand how we are uniquely created and burdened by God to meet specific needs. And, equally helpfully, it will steer us away from those areas where we cannot contribute nearly as well.\n\nI heartily recommend the book, provided you read with Essentialism in one hand, and the Bible in the other.\n\nLet me close with a few of my favorite quotes:\n\nIn many cases we can learn to make one-time decisions that make a thousand future decisions so we don’t exhaust ourselves asking the same questions again and again.\n\nIf you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.\n\nWe can either make our choices deliberately or allow other people’s agendas to control our lives.\n\nThere are three deeply entrenched assumptions we must conquer to live the way of the Essentialist: “I have to,” “It’s all important,” and “I can do both.”\n\nIf … people are too busy to think, then they’re too busy, period.\n\nMaking our criteria both selective and explicit affords us a systematic tool for discerning what is essential and filtering out the things that are not.\n\nMotivation and cooperation deteriorate when there is a lack of purpose.\n\nHalf of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.\n\n“We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’ ”",
    "I thought that this book is worth sharing to many. I usually many books so I don't take the time to write a review. However, it's my pleasure to write this review because it's very thoughtfully constructed. It was a quick read and gets to the point. This is THE TOPIC of the moment. How to say NO when we have so many choices than ever before. Internal clarity would simplify our lives so that that every aspect is in harmony with another. I would also read THE POWER OF NOW by Eckhart Tolle. Spiritual maturity goes hand in hand with this book that calls out for INTENTIONAL LIVING, which is what is meant by CONSCIOUS LIVING in the present moment. Thank you for putting out a quality book. Most will reject this book because they don't have the discipline to eliminate the clutter. Imagine your entire life filled with moments that light you up! Cheers!",
    "Again, this is one of those books that I took in bite sized chunks. Read a bit, consider and try to put into practice until my actions were becoming habitual. You choose to improve or you don't.\n\n1. I have become much better at saying no, but saying it nicely or without actually using the word!\n2. I have become better at getting things done and prioritising what is and is not important to me (although that is still work in progress)\n3. I have become better at time management.\n4. I procrastinate less (not totally gone, but also work in progress)\n\nAll in all a very useful and thought provoking guide to help you take back control of areas of your life. It has certainly helped reduce my stresses and anxiety in life and I would strongly recommend reading if you are stressed or anxious.",
    "Single most memorable passage:\n\"Charlie O. Simms taught a Journalism 101 class at Beverly Hills High School. He started... by explaining the concept of a \"lead\". He explained that a lead contains the why, what , when, and who of the piece. It covers the ESSENTIAL(my emphasis) information. Then he gave them their first assignment: write a lead to a story.\nSimms began by presenting the facts of the story: \"Kenneth L. Peters, the principal of Beverly Hills High School, announced today that the entire high school faculty will travel to Sacramento next Thursday for a colloquium in new teaching methods. Among the speakers will be anthropologist Margaret Mead, college president Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, and California governor Edmund 'Pa' Brown\"\nThe students hammered away on their manual typewriters trying to keep up with the teacher's peace. Then they handed in their rapidly written leads. Each attempted to summarise the who, what where, and why as succinctly as possible: \"Margaret Mead, Maynard Hutchins, and Governor Brown will address the faculty on ...\"; \"Next Thursday, the high school faculty will ...\" Simms reviewed the students' leads and put them aside.\nHe then informed them that they were all wrong. The lead to the story, he said, was \"There will be no school on Thursday.\"\n\"In that instant,\" Nora Ephron(of [Sleepless in Seattle] and [When Harry met Sally]) recalled, \"I realised that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the POINT. It wasn't enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it MEANT. And why it MATTERED.\" Ephron added, \"He taught me something that works just as well in life as it does in journalism.\" \" p73-74\n\nDisclaimer - I have not read a whole lot of management/self-improvement books, so I cannot say that I am a very good judge of the genre. There is a danger that this book is actually littered with tired old cliches that I hadn't noticed, in which case I shouldn't have bothered you with this. That said -\n\nSelf-improvement books are a strange breed - myself included, you so often see people who read one and then complain that the book only wrote about the really obvious things. In the same sense, however, homo sapiens are a strange breed who never quite do what they know to be the obviously good things for themselves. grin emoticon Enter, then, the study of management - the study on \"coordination of the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives by using available resources efficiently and effectively\". Sounds like self-improvement on a larger scale, but with the added benefit of providing results from well-designed research.\n\nThe author is a management consultant with an MBA degree from Stanford. Perhaps naturally, the book often reads like a business strategy book with plenty of case studies from the corporate world, but as Ephron says, those methods can easily be used for life in general. The book's message can be neatly summed up in one sentence - \"Figure out what is really important and essential in your life, and eliminate everything else to focus your efforts and achieve maximum output/contribution to society\". The rest of the book is just filled up by how to achieve that goal.\n\nWhile 'the rest of the book' is coherently structured with a logical, well-suited flow and sensible, well-researched suggestions backed up by sociology/psychology research findings(these days it seems impossible to read something that doesn't quote [Flow] by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and [Thinking Fast and Slow] by Daniel Kahneman, although probably due to my reading interests. Perhaps I should just give up and add them to the reading list), some solutions that the author suggests will just sound implausible. One example is the importance of being able to say no to your boss so that you can concentrate on something more essential. Obviously, I cannot imagine myself doing so to my bosses, consultant surgeons. For some other solutions, I thought they can only be done when one is reasonably financially secure, so that he/she can take the risk/hit by cutting out/declining all the non-essential activities that regularly plague our lives. However, (as my stock-phrase goes) if we are to look at the moon instead of the finger pointing at the moon...\n\nThe part that really inspires me in this book is its single-minded pursuit and the determination for what constitutes the most important thing in our lives; what makes our lives meaningful for us(as illustrated in the above anecdote), and what will ultimately enable us to be useful to the rest of the humanity. Sure, it may not always be obvious to all of us, and the method of elimination the book suggests may not guarantee to lead us to an answer. In fact, our lives may quite possibly be meaningless! :-D Nevertheless, for me it is certainly worth a try.\n\nThe other aspects that left a strong impression for me was the authors repeated emphasis on how pursuing Essentialism is a choice, and the importance of EMOTIONAL(not intellectual) acceptance of the book's ideas for them to work - which is to say, as discussed at the beginning, it is not because we don't know what to do why we don't do them. There is always a choice, and we simply choose not to.",
    "Essentially, don’t spread yourself too thin and keep prioritising. For me, I found this book rather demotivating as someone who struggles to keep all the balls in the air at home and work and consistently overcommits. Each section has a table that breaks down the kind of stuff non-essentialists do and what a perfect essentialist person would do differently. However, this had the opposite effect on me to what the author intended. I was just left feeling a bit rubbish and thinking ‘yeah, I’m a non-essentialist - I’m never going to change! WAHHH!’\n\nWhat worked better for me was Tony Crabbe’s Busy. This got more into the psychology of why people tend to overcommit, get distracted or avoid stuff in the first place. Tony Crabbe also uses coaching strategies to help the reader come up with their own solutions.\n\nSorry - Essentialism wasn’t for me! It may work for some though...",
    "Some nice ideas in this book but not very well written and most of them are just not practical unless you have the money to skip off the south of France for 6 months. Also using Rosa Parks & Gandhi as examples feels a bit crass especially when you put them next to another examples in the book like saying no because they had to plan a wedding. All the ideas in the book could easily fit into a shot blog. All in all ok but nothing really new or useful for 99% of us that actually have bosses and need to pay the bill.",
    "I think the author is rather milking the point, which is against the ethos of his subject matter. I feel an easier read on the subject is Gary Keller's The One Thing."

    "It’s a good book to highlight many good ideas. They are mainly focusing on 3 topics, Wealth, Happiness, and Wisdom. And Naval did a good job to summarize the lessons he learned and they are definitely thought-provoking.\n\nHowever, I still feel that the ideas from this book are not original. They are from other sources and it’s not a secret. They openly reference original source and spark the curiosity to dig deeper. But since they are not original, they didn’t affect me as if the original source of ideas would. And it’s okay. It just means I need to ream more books from Naval’s recommendations.\n\nI liked the book and now I want to explore more from Naval’s recommendation.",
    "I guarantee that anyone who left a bad review regarding the contents of this book is wrong. If you don’t understand the formatting and layout, it’s probably because you didn’t read the foreword and introduction. This book completely changed my life. And the credit ultimately belongs to Naval. He is just out of this world and incredible. I would also recommend listening to his podcast.

    "This is from someone, who read the PDF document, witnessed the progress on Twitter (albeit not from the start), and still waiting for the Amazon order to ship. I am not directly involved with this project in any way, just a reader.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about Naval. He has broadened my perspective on wealth creation and continues to inspire me to think bigger and better. So, his content, tweets, and interviews are guaranteed to be worthwhile. Plus, he seldomly goes on media, so the wisdom in each conversation is even more valuable.\n\nSecond, I want to talk about Eric. This book is the product of several beautiful coincidences: Eric making a casual poll on Twitter to compile Naval's words, Naval giving Eric his blessings & dumping all his Tweets on Eric, and Eric prioritizing this over everything to produce a high-quality book of 200+ pages. I really want to thank Eric for taking the lead to do this thing many want but won't do. It's just like a start-up: we all want this thing, so why aren't anyone doing it already?\n\nThird, everyone who is part of the production process is incredible. Publishing is a very messy business. Very complicated, sometimes frustrating. However, this book has such great design, format, edits, graphics, etc. To the twenty+ people working on this and even more beta-testing readers, thank you for making this a possibility.\n\nLast, Almanack is something that is always worth your money. Benjamin Franklin and Charlie Munger are behind some of the most re-readable books, and I think Naval's book will be one that's representative of the 21st Century. To publish an almanack, the subject first needs to have enough substance for that. Naval certainly does. (Peter Thiel's Zero to One is sort of his almanack, when you think about it)\n\nI hope this book can sell a lot of copies. Even more important, I hope people who read it can actively make use of the lessons and wisdom contained. Then, readers from other countries can get their hands on translations. People read less and less on average now, and I'm worried about the future as depicted in \"Fahrenheit 451\", when people have to recite books...\n\nBuy a book, pass on the fire!",
    "I gave full star for this book because the writer deserves the credit for the amount of work he has put on this book. I know it'll be difficult but if we read this book again and again and try to apply this in our lives, our life would be amazing.",
    " I had never heard of Naval Ravikant. Suddenly \"The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness\" kept popping up on my radar. When the universe calls, you listen.\n\nRead the book\n\nAn excellent book that is full of wisdom. In this blog, I will cover topics at random (from my own filter bubble). My advice is to buy the book and read it (maybe read it a few times).\n\nHere it goes:\n\nWealth is a skill set.\nSeek wealth, not money or status.\nFocus on specific knowledge. Specific knowledge is the knowledge you cannot be trained for. It cannot be outsourced or automated. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. \nFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products.\nWrite books and blogs and record videos and podcasts if you can't code. The new generation's fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan is making $50 million to $100 million a year from his podcast.\nThere is no skill called \"business.\" Avoid business magazines and business classes.\nIntentions don't matter. Actions do. That's why being ethical is hard.\nEmbrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. Accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of failure when things go badly. Skin in the game (he is a fan of Taleb too).\nInspiration is perishable—act on it immediately\nIn 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them.\nPatience. Immediate doesn't work.\nPeople are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve. Always pay it forward. And don't keep count. Karma management.\nIf you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art—become really good at something. \nThe definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions.\nIt's only after you're bored that you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, busy, running around or rushed. Make the time.\nFacebook redesigns. Twitter redesigns. Personalities, careers, and teams also need redesigns. There are no permanent solutions in a dynamic system.\nIf you can't decide, the answer is no.\nIf you're evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.\nThe world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. You always have three options: you can change it, accept it, or leave it.\nWhen everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease.\nWorld's simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume.\nWhat habit would you say most positively impacts your life? The daily morning workout. I decided my number one priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my health. To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first.\nYour breath is one of the few places where your autonomic nervous system meets your voluntary nervous system. Read \"Breathe\" \nMeditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.\nYou're dying and being reborn at every moment. It's up to you whether to forget or remember that. \nAbout time\n\nValue your time. It is all you have. It's more important than your money. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate, and you have to stick to it. Always factor your time into every decision.\nBecome the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It's usually things you're obsessed about\nIf you're not 100 per cent into it, somebody else who is 100 per cent into it will outperform you.\nFollowing your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now. \nEscape competition through authenticity.\nAbout entrepreneurship\n\nWithout ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. Owning equity in a company means you own the upside. You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. \nThere are almost 7 billion people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7 billion companies. Entrepreneurship is the future.\nWhat you want in life is to be in control of your time.\nAbout freedom\n\nWhat you really want is freedom. You want freedom from your money problems. One way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate. The second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero—you become a monk. A third is that you're doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, and it's not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.\nPart of being free means I can say what I think and think what I say.\nAbout reputation\n\nCompounding in business relationships is very important. Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Having a reputation will make people do deals through you.\nIf you are a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term-thinking dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don't know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal just because of the integrity and reputation you've built up.\nAbout reading\n\nReading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. Learn to love to read. I probably read one to two hours a day. That puts me in the top .00001 per cent. When someone mentions a book to me, I buy it. At any given time, I'm reading somewhere between ten and twenty books. I'm flipping through them.\nAny book that survived for two thousand years has been filtered through many people. The general principles are more likely to be correct. \nYou know that song you can't get out of your head? All thoughts work that way. Careful what you read.\nAbout happiness\n\nHappiness is not something you inherit or even choose, but a highly personal skill that can be learned, like fitness or nutrition. To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It's not about negative thoughts. It's about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things.\nReal happiness only comes as a side-effect of peace. Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment. \nI have lowered the chattering of my mind. I don't care about things that don't really matter. I\nEnvy is the enemy of happiness.\nHappiness is built by habits.\nRecover time and happiness by minimizing your use of these three smartphone apps: phone, calendar, and alarm clock. \nA personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest? \nIncrease serotonin in the brain without drugs: Sunlight, exercise, positive thinking, and tryptophan. \nYou're going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work. \nThe thinking\n\nThere is something deliberate about Naval Ravikant's thinking. It is also very clear. First-principles. Stoicism. Habits. Choices. And keeping it simple. It is an entrepreneur version of \"Solve for happy\". Which is also a cracking book.",

    "This book is great! It is full of concepts and examples of how to build cohesive teams/ groups. I plan to put them to work in my new posiyion. Good work, Mr. Coyle!",
    "Muy buena narrativa y como va llevando al lector con las historias contadas en un viaje conceptual de fácil comprensión.",
    "There are a lot of books about culture and how to create a strong and healthy one. Daniel Coyle knew that a strong and effective culture is part of the secret sauce of successful organizations. He knew that “A strong culture increases net income 756 percent over 11 years, according to a Harvard study of more than 200 companies.” He thought he could look at strong cultures in a different way and write a book about it. Here’s how he puts it.\n\n“I spent the last four years visiting and researching eight of the world’s most successful groups, including a special-ops military unit, an inner-city school, a professional basketball team, a movie studio, a comedy troupe, a gang of jewel thieves, and others. I found that their cultures are created by a specific set of skills”\n\nCoyle started with a definition of culture that’s a little bit different than the norm. He says, “Culture is a set of living relationships working toward a shared goal. It’s not something you are, it’s something you do.”\n\nSo, what is it that you do? What do people in organizations that create strong cultures do that their peers in other organizations don’t do?\n\nCoyle organizes the book into three sections, each one of which relates to a specific skillset. The three skills are: build safety; share vulnerability; and establish purpose.\n\nThere are several chapters about each skill. There’s a good mix of stories and studies. Coyle chooses his examples carefully and tells their stories well. He doesn’t use bullet points or frequent summaries, so sometimes you will work to tease out his meaning. You can get a sense of this if you review my highlights from the Culture Code on Goodreads.\n\nMost business authors put summaries of key points or action steps at the end of every chapter. Coyle doesn’t. Instead, he includes a chapter at the end of every section, titled “Ideas for Action.” That chapter functions as a review of the other chapters in the section. I think that’s a good device, but I’d rather he also put his key points at the end of every chapter.\n\nCoyle’s a good storyteller and he makes it a point to try to tell stories you may have heard before from an angle where you haven’t seen them before. One of those stories is the story about Tylenol and its credo. Another is the story of the founding of Pixar.\n\nIn telling those stories, Coyle leaves out some interesting and potentially helpful things. For example, he tells us about the meeting where Johnson & Johnson executives reviewed the company’s credo to see if it should be revised. We know there was a meeting. But Coyle never tells us whether they changed the credo or not at that meeting. He simply jumps ahead to the Tylenol crisis, where the credo became guiding principles for one of the most successful disaster recovery examples ever.\n\nThen, there’s the story of Ed Catmull and Pixar. Coyle says, “If you set out to design a life that represented the perfect merger of art and science, you might design one that looks like Catmull’s.” Then, just below, after mentioning a little bit about Catmull’s parents and his early interests, he says “After college, he landed a job with George Lucas…”\n\nWell yes, it was, technically, “after college,” but it was a full five years after Catmull got his PhD. And, after talking about the life as a model for the perfect merger of art and science, Coyle leaves out the fact that in his pre-Lucas and pre-Pixar days, Ed Catmull worked on projects for ARPA during the time he was working as a physicist.\n\nThose are important things to know if you want to learn how Ed Catmull developed into the manager he is today. You can learn more about them in his book, Creativity, Inc, about his life and Pixar.\n\nSpecial Note\n\nChapters 15 and 16 are worth reading, even if you skip everything else. Chapter 15 is “How to Lead for Proficiency” while chapter 16 is “How to Lead for Creativity.” The two skills are different and which one you choose as a manager will determine what values you treasure and what kinds of performance you optimize.\n\nIn A Nutshell\n\nThis is a book that will help you create a strong and supportive culture where you are. There are problems with the book, but they’re not big enough or consistent enough to really detract from the value. If you want to learn about how to create and maintain a positive and strong culture in your team or organization, buy and read The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups by Daniel Coyle.",
    "I teach math and coach high school volleyball and a player heading off to college said his future college coach made this mandatory summer reading. I picked it up and found it to be an in depth, yet simple read. I recommended it to a past player before I was even half way through and he had already read it.\nAnyone that works in teams, may be a leader, or just wants to know what makes great companies so great can benefit from this book.",
    "This is a great book on culture and I've now read it 3 times in the last few years just to help remind my brain of some of the nuances of it. Great concepts in the book, although it's harder to actually implement the things within the book. More of a \"why\" book, than a \"how to\" book in my opinion, but I still find it very helpful because it helps identify areas that companies should focus on while building culture.",
    "I love the stories of teams and corporations that have “Catch Phrases” that make their teams function with precision. That’s what I take most from Culture Code.",
    "Superb book on what it takes to develop culture in teams and organisations. Culture is far more than aphorisms, work drinks and coffee breaks; it’s about safety, belonging, purpose, contribution and togetherness.\n\nOne of the best organisational psychology books I have read!",
    "Third book for Jan: “The Culture Code” by Daniel Coyle. I went into this looking for insight on how Sarah and I can build a life-giving culture for our growing family. Many of the ideas in this book were not new, in fact if you’ve picked up books on highly productive groups (think Pixar, Navy Seals, Amazon, etc) you’ve probably come across this material. However, Coyle puts the ideas in one place, in highly readable content that is applicable for any context.\n.\n.\n.\nThe book is framed around three skills for building a great group culture: Build Safety, Share Vulnerability, Establish Purpose. Easy enough. But it was the insights gained from various controlled experiments and the wisdom given by those interviewed that really helped me take the abstract and begin to see these ideas in practice. For instance, safety: Much of the inertia in group projects involves the safety within the group- “How am I performing?”, “How do I compare to my teammates?”, “Can I tell them what I honestly feel about their work?”, “What role do I play in this?”, “Who is the leader?”...How do groups overcome this? It starts with belonging cues. Belonging cues can be eye contact, physical touch, close proximity, short exchanges (no long speeches), lots of questions, active listening, humor, etc. Really anything that tells others, “Hey you belong here. You’re safe here. You and your work are valued. Help the team get better.”\n.\n.\n.\nThen there’s vulnerability. Sharing vulnerability in a group empowers others and unlocks a group’s ability to perform. The two sentences that underpin the section are: “Anybody have any ideas? Tell me what you want, and I’ll help you.” They come from stories where people in positional power risk vulnerability to help their groups fuse collective energy and achieve something better than any one of them could’ve done alone. Vulnerability tells others: “I can’t do this alone. But we can do it together”.\n.\n.\n.\nLastly establishing purpose. It goes without saying- aim at nothing and you’ll get it every time. But aim at the wrong thing and you’ll get that too. Develop a mission statement. Anchor to it in all you do as a group.\n.\n.\n.\nHighly Recommend.",
    "I was little disappointed by this book. If you not read many books about leadership, then this would be a really good place to start. It is easy reading, and the points are made through real life examples and stories rather than theory, The disappointment for me is there was very little here that can't be found elsewhere, but if you are new to all of this then it would make a really good introduction - so much of the work of team building seems counter intuitive at first, and this book covers that well",
    "Fab book. Really interesting little anecdotes that illustrate quite complex theory and psychology. What was best was how actions and behaviours were clearly illustrated that could be applied by any individual committed enough to try. Have shared with my entire leadership team and it has had a profoundly positive effect on our business. Would definitely recommend. Writing style had a lovely tone and wasn't all about the writer. Buy it.",
    "If you work in a team, but especially if you lead one, this book is not good; it is absolutely fantastic. This ranks as one of the most important learning resources in existence in terms of group performance. Buy this book now, immediately read it five times, implement everything in it and watch your culture become the primary driver of results in your business or team. Then buy Talent Code, another game changer from this author, and repeat the process.\nThe best thing about this book is that the principles within it have a cumulative effect; the more you implement, the more often they are repeated and the longer they remain in place, the more acute and sustainable the positive results. Whether you are running a FTSE100 business, or coaching a Sunday League football team, you must read this book.",
    "A fascinating insight into what can be achieved when minds are in harness and committed to delivering above-and-beyond results.\n\nLots of examples, case studies and creative thinking here - this is a must for anyone working in a team or looking to encourage people to achieve their true potential.\n\nAn easy to engage with book, clearly written and with lots of inspirational pointers.\n\nA great read.",
    "Each of the three main sections has an 'Action Point' list which is great for practical implementation of Coyle's ideas.\nI also liked the chapter on the main differences between Proficient Teams and Creative Teams.\nI work with many start-ups designing team profiling tools (Rob Williams Assessment Ltd) so know a credible team productivity model when I see one!"

    "From my point of view, Fanatical Prospecting is a great personal development book. It is probably good for prospecting too.\n\nI don’t prospect. I fear rejection like any sane person, and according to Jeb Blount, the author of \"Fanatical Prospecting:\"\n\n\"prospecting is hard, grueling, rejection-dense work.”\n\nThus, I built my business ventures to avoid prospecting and rejection. My customers come to me; I don’t look for them. I qualify them before I get on the call with them. And I don’t really need new customers. My attrition rates are low. A few new customers a month is more than enough for me. When COVID robbed me of my health and sanity, I did nothing in my business for three months. My revenue slumped only by about 50%.\n\nI didn’t really need to read this book. I read it because it was a lecture in my mastermind. And I don’t regret it at all.\n\nNo CONS\nUsually, I start my reviews with some negatives. Well, I cannot do it with Fanatical Prospecting. I’m the guy who didn’t need the book, and I’m delighted with it! I liked everything in Fanatical Prospecting. On the other hand, I can enumerate a massive list of…\n\nPROS\n1. Very well written.\n\nI’m an avid reader. I read 50-100 books a year. And Fanatical Prospecting stood out, significantly.\n\nIt’s a nonfiction book that reads a bit like a thriller. It has just enough stories to illustrate the points. These are real-life stories, short and to the point. The author doesn’t beat the dead horse. The material is meaty and delivered in a common, simple, understandable language.\n\nThis is just a great read. Which leads me to another PRO…\n\n2. Extremely Quotable.\n\nI have 157 highlights of this book in my Kindle. It easily positions it among the top 5% of the books I read. Maybe even 1%.\n\nMost of those highlights were great soundbites – powerful one-liners, like:\n\n\"In sales you are owed nothing!”\n\n“Prospecting is hard, emotionally draining work, and it is the price you have to pay to earn a high income.”\n\n“Elite salespeople, like elite athletes, track everything.”\n\n“Effective delegation begins with effective communication.”\n\nThe above is just a sample out of dozens and dozens of great quotes I highlighted.\n3. Brother from Another Mother.\n\nI also liked the book because it was so in line with my own personal philosophy. I found myself nodding furiously in agreement about every other chapter.\n\nThe importance of tracking? Checked.\n\n\"You cannot be delusional and successful at the same time.\nDelusion gets you nowhere.”\n\nThe importance of perseverance? Checked.\n\n\"Just remember. In sales persistence always wins. Always.”\n\nThe importance of small consistent daily actions? Checked.\n\n\"Every major failure in my life has been a direct result of a collapse in my self-discipline to do the little things every day. Frankly, that is all failure really is.”\n\nEvery fear is real? Checked.\n\n\"This is why you feel physically anxious before you ask. Your mind reels, palms sweat, stomach tightens, and muscles become tense as you subconsciously prepare for ‘no.’ This is the root cause of your feeling of fear.”\n\nC’mon! This is the exact description of what I had felt when I worked on overcoming my shyness. To the letter. It’s like Jeb had been in my head and described my bodily sensations.\n\n4. Secrets of Trade.\nJeb has the amazing ability of getting to the essence of things. Fanatical Prospecting is full of tiny tidbits revealing secrets hidden in plain sight. Just a few of them:\n\n\"The secret: Speak in public, regularly.”\n\nThis refers to the secret of being good with sales calls. I wouldn’t have ever thought of it. But hey, Jeb is the expert here. If he states that public speaking makes you a better salesman, who am I to argue?\n\n\"There is only one technique that really works for getting what you want on a prospecting touch. Ask.”\n\nAmen to that. We overcomplicate things, not only in the sales process, but in life. One technique; drop mike.\n\n\"The easiest, fastest way to get someone’s attention is to use the most beautiful word in the world to them—their name.”\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People 101. Yet, it’s the underutilized secret even for those who read the book.\n\n\"The ‘single most powerful technique’ to get past gatekeepers is to use please twice.”\n\n“Yes, it’s as easy as this. ‘Please, could you connect me with your boss, please?'”\n\n5. Ruthlessly Honest.\nI loved how the book started – from telling why the sales profession is so hard and so profitable at the same time.\n\n\"Prospecting is hard, emotionally draining work, and it is the price you have to pay to earn a high income.”\n\nJeb Blount doesn’t beat around the bush. He goes straight to the point and he doesn’t try to paint the sky pink. If something is “hard, grueling, rejection-dense” (another of his description of prospecting), he states it in plain words.\n\nThe author is also not afraid to articulate his position on things that get on his nerves. They get on my nerves too.\n\n\"Political correctness has run amuck.”\n\n“In your life, mediocrity is like a broke uncle. Once he moves into your house, it is nearly impossible to get him to leave.”\n\n6. Funny.\nNot hilarious. Just funny enough to crack a smile from time to time and lighten the mood. And Jeb’s sense of humor is right down my alley.\n\n\"Privacy? Forget about privacy. You are in sales.”\n\n“(…)smartphone. Twenty minutes later, you find yourself watching a video of a chimpanzee riding a giraffe around a circus tent and can’t remember how you got there.”\n\n“Get it through your thick skull that nobody cares about you or what you have to say. They want to talk about themselves.”\n\n7. Productivity Tips.\nI consider the productivity tips sprinkled throughout the book to be the most universal message of Fanatical Prospecting. Seriously, stay-at-home moms could have used them with success.\n\n\"For salespeople, though, most time management problems are self-inflicted.”\n\nMost time management problems are self-inflicted for every profession where you are free to choose your own schedule. Every freelancer, health practitioner with a private practice, business owner or even independent specialist in the corpo environment commits the same productivity sins.\n\n\"The two biggest prospecting derailers for sales professionals are e-mail and mobile devices.”\n\n“Those are the two biggest derailers for everyone who works with a mobile device and/or email.”\n\n“You cannot be efficient when you are constantly being distracted.”\n\nThe above applies to virtually everybody. Yet, with the stubbornness worthy of a better cause, everybody tries to multitask.\n\n\"The most expensive thing you can do in sales is spend your time with the wrong prospect.”\n\nThat hit too close to home. I already pre-qualify my prospects; yet, still the most worthless time I spent is on the prospecting calls with someone I shouldn’t have been speaking in the first place.\n\n8. Personal Development.\nEspecially the last part about mental toughness was very inspiring. If Jeb wasn’t a great salesman, he could’ve become a great motivational speaker.\n\nMental toughness is just icing on the cake. The whole book is full of powerful statements which applies directly to one’s ability to be honest with themselves and do the work. Self-discipline, self-awareness, proper planning, mental attitude – those things are the part of the sales and prospecting processes as much as they are part of life.\n\nAs I already stated, I didn’t need to read Fanatical Prospecting very much. I’m a business owner, but I’m in the early stage of my business, where my sales skills are not crucial for my success.\n\nHowever, as a solopreneur, I am my business. So, while the prospecting message was mostly an interesting piece of research for me, the personal development teachings ‘in the background’ were the most valuable for me.\n\nSummary\nI recommend this book for every entrepreneur. If your business depends on your sales skills, you will find it doubly valuable.\n\nHowever, I found \"Fanatical Prospecting\" a personal development book first and foremost. And a great one in this field too.\n\nThe last time I checked, every single human being could have used some more personal development. Thus, I wholeheartedly recommend Jeb Blount’s book to everyone.",
    "There is a reason why sales people earn more money than anyone else. They have grit, they have faith, they have persistence and they fanatically prospect.\nThose who don’t, don’t stay in sales very long.\nThose who do, those who pair forward, doing what others won’t do, rip huge rewards.\nSales is an amazing game.\nJP",
    "Made some good points but it was a little drawn out. My boss made us all read it. It's fine as a tool for discussion but you can also probably find similar books saying the same thing or even just youtube channel. It wasn't anything ground breaking and in my case- it was super general. Lots of good B2C sales advice but my group does B2B in a highly technical field with a long sales cycle- so while the advice was still generically applicable- its not a magic bullet of advice for all situations. (The b2b example the book kept using was insurance sales.... someday i'd like to be forced to read a book about B2B in technical field.)",
    "Sales people constitute a significant percentage of the workforce, ranging from outbound call centre operators to new business developers. Many people whose professions require that they be actively engaged in sales do not bear the title of “salesperson”. As such this book on prospecting should be of interest to many.\nIt is a practical guide to what makes relatively ordinary people into superb salespeople. Sales begins with prospecting, a skill that must be mastered by all.\nThe easiest time to introduce “social selling” to a sales person is on one of their down days, when the pipeline is thin and prospects are few. Social selling is often positioned as the panacea that will drive quality prospects to you.\nIn reality, “contact and conversion rates from phone and e-mail dwarf conversion rates on social media,” asserts Blount. Yes, the social media can enhance and sometimes accelerate your prospecting efforts, and it can definitely heighten familiarity. However, “it is not a replacement for focused and deliberate outbound prospecting efforts,” Blount explains. One’s largest and most lucrative prospects rarely respond to inbound-marketing or to social selling.\nThe only way you will achieve your numbers is to make targeted, prospecting outbound calls.\nWe have long held that “interruption selling” is a relic of the past to be avoided by the savvy salesperson. In a crowded, competitive marketplace, interruption selling remains the most effective practice. Within “interruption selling” there are many prospecting methodologies, and no single formula fits all. Every geography, industry, product, and service requires a different approach.\nSalespeople needs to balance their prospecting in order to build a database with long-term opportunities, as they fill their sales pipeline with deals they can close immediately. To do this, Blount notes, we need to master the three laws that form the basis of successful prospecting.\nThe first is “The Universal Law of Need”. The law states that the more you need something, the less likely it is that you will get it. Consider the times when your survival rested on a just a few accounts. With a heightened probability of failure, your desperation seeped through. During times like these you become emotional, act illogically, and make poor decisions.\nProspects can sense your desperation, and naturally favour sales professionals who exude confidence over those who are desperate.\nThe second law is “The 30-Day Law”. This law states that the prospecting you do in the current 30-day period, will pay off for the next 90 days.\nSkip one day of prospecting and sometime in the next 90 days you will be punished for it. Skip one week, and the consequence will be felt in your commission cheque. Skipping an entire month and your pipeline will empty and you will “wake up 90 days later, desperate, feeling like a loser, with no clue how you ended up there,” Blount warns. This particular seduction is usually preceded by a month or two of great business.\nThe unrelenting daily imperative for every salesperson, is to keep the pipeline full with qualified prospects\nThe third of the laws is “The Law of Replacement.” Violating the Law of Replacement is the reason salespeople feel like they are on a roller coaster. You must replace your prospects at a rate that matches or exceeds your closing ratio. If you have 40 prospects and your closing ratio is 1 in10, as soon as you close one prospect, you do not have 39 left, you have only 30 and you need to replace not 1, but 10.\nThe anatomy of a sales slumps take on a familiar form. At some point you stopped prospecting and your sales pipeline stalled. This failure leads to an erosion of your confidence and in desperation you call the same, stale prospects. You start hoping for silver bullets, and experience the Universal Law of Need.\nWhen you are in a hole, is advisable to stop digging; when you are in a sales slump, it is advisable to start prospecting. Worry won't change the future, nor will regret over what you have not done. You will most often require about 30 days of dedicated, daily activity to get back on track, Blount explains.\nThe more you prospect, the luckier you get. Will training, experience, and technique make you a better prospector? Of course, Blount believes. However, “It is far more important that you prospect consistently than that you prospect using the best techniques,” he explains.\nSales has always been governed by numbers. The sales formula for success is simple. What (quality) you put into the sales pipeline and how much (quantity) determines what you get out of the pipe. Just as elite athletes focus on their statistics, elite salespeople need to do so, too.\n“To succeed in sales, simply talk to lots of people every day. And here's what's exciting—there are lots of people!” said the legendary sales trainer, Jim Rohn. This is the fundamental principle of prospecting.\nRead this book if you are in sales or run a sales team. It is full of practical techniques.\nReadability Light -+--- Serious\nInsights High --+-- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\nIan Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy",
    "I bought this book because of the five star ratings but now I'm beginning to question them. Nothing new in the book and the few examples of prospecting calls are of the high pressure type.....the kind that gives cold calling a bad name. They're of the \"I'm calling to set an appointment with you, does Monday at 10 suit?\" Variety.\n\nThe author is very disparaging of sales reps in general. This book is just a long article and it's only purpose is to serve as an expensive business card.\n\nI cannot in good conscious recommend this book.",
    "It's about prospecting as it says on the cover. Jeb takes you through the process of why prospect, to the different reasons why there needs to be a prospecting culture within a company and why as a sales person you need to prospect. If you are new to sales or just want to update yourself on prospecting then go for it. Of course there isn't anything earth shattering new in here, we have been prospecting for years, but hey if prospecting 101 is what you want. It's a good start.",
    "This is the antidote to ABC (Always Be Closing) selling. Jeb Blount makes the case for a combination of a systematic approach and plain hard work plus doing the basic homework on how you and your product / service can be relevant to prospective clients. Much of what Jeb outlines chimes with my own experience in professional B2B sales. His advice to \"make one more call\" before you go home for the day is golden.",
    "The message in this book is important, consistent, regular prospecting is crucial. The book goes off on slight tangents at times and could probably be summarised in half the number of pages. Nevertheless, it's an important book that should be read by the vast majority of business owners and sales pros.",
    "This book was very timely for me and taught me a very valuable lesson: Always be prospecting! If you're in sales and waiting for leads to come in, your pipeline will never be full and you won't make your quota. This book has taught me the discipline of blocking out prospecting time every day, to ensure you always have opportunities. It has also told me how to go about prospecting the right way - by having having a focus on the client issue first, rather than trying to simply sell your product. Highly recommended."

    "Book came in great condition. I was kind of worried due to the lack of packaging but it worked out in my favor this time.",
    "My son had to get this book for school reading & said it’s pretty good so far.",
    "I teach rhetoric and communication at my local community college, and my son and I reading this book together. Very readable for his age group, but some of the Simpsons references are before the average teenager’s time.\n\nThe author, however, mistakes chiasmus for antimetabole. They share similar aims, but chiasmus reverses the concepts, and antimetabole reverses the actual language.",
    "While this book does lay out the basics of rhetorical arguments in an understandable way, I would have legitimately preferred a dry, dull missive compared to this ego-laden attempt to seem cool and relevant. I kept waiting for the big reveal where the author revealed he was secretly using rhetoric as a way to accidentally turn his audience against him because that's what it felt like it was doing. I could not have imagined a more grating book for myself utilizing every single trick that turns me off as a reader. From the times he assigns manipulative rhetorical techniques to his family via anecdotes (but don't worry, his wife thinks he's hot!) that always show him to be reasonable and in the right if sort of bumbling and long-suffering, to his loaded pop culture references that reveal his misunderstanding and disdain a bit too much, it's a slog from start to finish.\n\nIf I were asked to write a book from the point of view of a white, male, cis, liberal East Coast elite - who happens to get to write books all day in his cabin in Maine while his wife supports him - this is the book I would have written. If I were to write a book about why people dislike philosophers or political analysts or lawyers, it would look like this. It reads like a parody. But I suppose that this guy laughs all the way to the bank, so what do I know?\n\nI will say this, in terms of recognizing his audience and winning them over to his point of view, in my case, it was a hilariously bad rhetorical failure. I must conclude I am not the intended audience.\n\nReview is for the Kindle edition. It was readable and searchable and nothing seemed to be wrong with it aside from the contents.",
    "I'd looked for textbooks and used others to help teach my college persuasive writing class and hadn't been able to find something that spoke to the students. Jay Heinrichs' book is a fast read while implementing solid argument inventions into his writing. There are exercises and examples which help with my writing class.\n\nThis is a really good book on rhetoric that has the fundamentals of rhetoric, calling up the roles of Socrates and Aristotle on language. It also encompasses how to apply these ideas to everyday conversations with family and friends.\n\nAfter reading this book, you will look at everyone, especially talking TV pundits, so differently. If only we all could have a little bit more informed rhetoric inside of us going on, we might not be so polarized as we are now. Truly is a skill for all.",
    "The material covered in this book is excellent. The execution of making a Kindle edition is poor at best.\nIn several sections there are obvious pages that were left out of the file. While not rendering the book useless, it does render the book a poor value. The publisher that renders these files must be aware of the omissions. An electronic file that is missing pages does not have the same economic advantage of paper cost or binding cost. The file cost is identical with a complete one.\nAvoid the Kindle version and pay for the book. It is not that much more and the convenience of the Kindle is not worth the frustration of trying to move on when some of the explanations and examples are missing from the e book.\nThis is another example of Amazon selling shoddy products and pocketing the money anyway.",
    "The author seems to just show off his knowledge of rhetoric leaving the reader puzzled with a plethora of “tools” and unnecessary jargon. It doesn’t help me to know how smartly famous people and the author use rhetorical tricks to persuade their audiences. There is very little practical advice that I actually want to use when I’m on the spot. (BTW, “Stehrwitt” is NOT a German word.)",
    "I simply could not finish this book. The author clearly understands rhetoric and manipulation, but absolutely dilutes his teachings with bias and examples that make no sense outside of a political construct.\n\nI am exhausted from reading his examples of manipulation on his wife and kids in ways that are obviously damaging their personal relationships.\nThe author also makes it very clear that he has something against scientists and educated individuals. He calls scientists \"childish\" and people with degrees \"eggheads\".\n\nI can see the rhetorical points he makes past his abrasive judgement, but not everyone is going to take the time (or energy) to dissect his teachings on every page. I'm shocked to hear that this is a required reading for some high schoolers. I would highly recommend a different book or textbook about rhetorical theory or critical thinking.\n\nI told myself I would keep reading and attempt to learn what I could from the author while ignoring his comments and examples... I got to chapter 10 and simply could not continue.",

    "The Ideal Team Player starts as a fable and makes the beginning very real and insightful. After the fable, Lencioni dives into the details that make up the ideal team player - hungry, humble and smart.\n\nFor any organization to have a successful culture, their important virtues need to be clearly defined and of upmost importance in the hiring process and in the refining process of their current employees. Lencioni argues that hungry, humble and smart are the three keys for building a successful team and that each member MUST possess these three traits.\n\n1. Hungry - these are people who always look for more and rarely have to be pushed to work harder. Healthy hunger is a manageable and sustainable commitment to doing a job well and going above and beyond when it is truly required. These employees finish their tasks and look for ways to support the rest of the team or look for ways to grow. *Be aware - in an interview - candidates can project a false hunger\n\n2. Humility - this is the single greatest and most indispensable attribute of being a team player. Too many leaders, who value teamwork, tolerate arrogant employees - not understanding the effect it has on the rest of the team.\n\nThere are Two types of People who Lack Humility:\n1. Overtly arrogant - they boast and soak up attention - these are easy to spot\n2. Those who lack self confidence - they are generous and positive with others but they discount their own talents and contributions. They are mistakenly seen as humble - their lack of understanding of their own worth is a violation of humility. They hurt teams by not advocating for their opinion or not calling out issues. *Insecurity is what both types have in common*\n\nC.S. Lewis \"Humilty isn't thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less\"\n\n3. Smart - NOT intelligence - this is common sense about people. They ask good questions, listen to others, stay engaged in conversations intently\n\npg. 166-173 warns us of the different types of people. DO NOT hire or keep someone who lacks all of these characteristics or only has 1 of them. IF they have 2 of the 3, having humble and hungry is the least dangerous to a team as they can take feedback well and often want to improve\n\n*Be careful of what he calls the \"skillful politician\" who has hungry and smart - they can ruin a team and we have all worked with someone who speaks a good game but is only in it for themselves\n\n*Be careful how you label people as well. These traits don't have to be equally strong, but they all need to be relatively strong to be an ideal team player. If they are severely lacking in one area, that is of concern\n\npg. 174-186 discusses how to apply this to the interview process and offers good questions to use to assess the humble, hungry, smart. *Key point - BEFORE making an offer to a candidate assure them how absolutely committed you are to these virtues and anyone who does not share them would be miserable working here but if they do share them, it will be a fantastic fit. As he says \"many people will try to get a job even if they don't fit the company's stated values, but very few will do so if they know they're going to be held accountable, day in and day out, for behavior that violates the values\".\n\npg. 187-191 is assessing your current team to either make corrections or let people go. \"Too often, leaders know that an employee really doesn't belong and would be better elsewhere, and they fail to act because they lack courage\n\npg. 195-206 discusses how to develop these attributes.\n1. Humility - A leader should always model humility, even if the manager struggles, admit it and continue to work on it. This will encourage the others to do the same. A lack of humility is always related to an insecurity and for most, is rooted in a childhood or family issue that took place well before their first day on the job. So, helping an employee IDENTIFY the root cause and then putting them through EXPOSURE by requiring them to \"act\" humble (complimenting others, admitting mistakes, etc...) can have a major impact\n2. Hunger - this is often hard to change. First and most important step is finding a way to connect them to the importance of the work they are doing. Then set clear behavioral expectations for them and hold them accountable to it. MORE THAN THAT - tell them that you expect them to help their colleagues do what needs to be done once their work is completed, including taking on additional responsibilities, working more hours (if possible), or doing additional research until problems are solved\n3. Smart - the key to developing people smarts is to make it clear, to everyone involved, that a deficiency in this area is not about intention. Then, if someone is rude or insensitive, QUICKLY and LOVINGLY correct and encourage them. Remember, their intentions are not bad they are often just unaware\n\npg. 207-211 discusses how to embed these into a culture.\n1. Be Explicit and Bold - if you believe it is important, come right out and say so\n2. Catch and Revere - constantly be on the lookout for any displays of these virtues and when you see them, hold them up as examples for everyone to see. *\"What we are failing to realize is that the point of praise is not only to reinforce the behavior in that employee, but also to reinforce it in everyone else\"\n3. Detect and Address - When you see a behavior that violates the values, take the time to let the violator know he is out of line, and not just in egregious behaviors\n\nOverall, this book offers an incredible and thorough explanation of the importance of having ideal team players and the ways to find, train and refine them. This is a great read for anyone who is hiring, has employees, is an employee, or just about anyone",
    "Great content but reads hard because of how it’s set up.",
    "Good book and would buy again.",
    "I really gained a lot from reading this book. The principles he lays out are spot on",
    "If I were still a CEO, here's  The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results  I would do this week:\n\nSTEP 1. Order four copies of Patrick Lencioni's new book, The Ideal Team Player.\n\nSTEP 2. Hand-deliver the book, along with a Starbucks card, to each of my direct reports, with this assignment: \"Invest up to four hours at Starbucks this week—and read this important book. It's likely the most team-transforming exercise we’ll do together this year.\"\n\nSTEP 3. Schedule a half-day off-site team meeting (for next week) to discuss \"How to Recognize and Cultivate the Three Essential Virtues” (the book’s sub-title).\n\nSTEP 4. Facilitate the senior team meeting (or invite a facilitator to do the honors) and get buy-in and commitment (a la Lencioni's pyramid in  The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business ). Assign next steps.\n[...]\n\nSTEP 5. Step back and watch your culture transform as you articulate three virtues: Humble, Hungry, and People Smart.\n\nWow! Patrick Lencioni has done it again! This is one powerful book--and maybe his funniest. In his classic \"leadership fable\" format (example:  Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable...About Solving the Most Painful Problem in Business ), Lencioni delivers a page-turning business story. New CEO. Two direct reports. Massive dysfunction. New hires needed yesterday. (Sound familiar?)\n[...]\nBut there's another problem: the top three leaders cannot define the \"ideal team player” qualities. (Can you?) Half of the people they hire either quit or are terminated. Finally…finally, they agree on one virtue:\n\n\"Maybe our new slogan should be\n'no jackasses allowed.'\nThat would make a great poster.\"\n\nSo, in search of more acceptable lingo and meaning, the leadership triad lands on Humble, Hungry, and Smart. Lencioni defines these virtues in the final 60 pages (The Model and application), worth the price of the book.\n\nHUMBLE: \"Great team players lack excessive ego or concerns about status.\" He adds, \"Humility is the single greatest and most indispensable attribute of being a team player.\"\n\nHUNGRY: \"Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent.\"\n\nSMART: \"Smart simply refers to a person's common sense about people.\"\n\nCaution #1: What if you settle for just one out of three? Or, if you're fortunate, two out of three virtues? After all, no one's perfect.\n\nLencioni: \"What makes humble, hungry, and smart powerful and unique is not the individual attributes themselves, but rather the required combination of all three.\"\n\nHis memorable labels for the \"one out of three\" prospects are caution enough:\n--Humble Only: The Pawn\n--Hungry Only: The Bulldozer\n--Smart Only: The Charmer\n\nWhat About 2 Out of 3?\n\n“The next three categories that we'll explore represent people who are more difficult to identify because the strengths associated with them often camouflage their weaknesses.\n\n“Team members who fit into these categories lack only one of the three traits and thus have a little higher likelihood of overcoming their challenges and becoming ideal team players. Still, lacking even one in a serious way can impede the team building process.”\n\nCaution #2: Don’t use the following labels at work—but they are perfect descriptors for your “2 out of 3” team members:\n\n--Hungry and Humble, but Not Smart: The Accidental Mess-Maker\n--Humble and Smart, but Not Hungry: The Lovable Slacker\n--Hungry and Smart, but Not Humble: The Skillful Politician\n\nWatch out for the banana peel when you’re interviewing a candidate without humility. \"Unfortunately, because they are so smart, Skillful Politicians are very adept at portraying themselves at being humble, making it hard for leaders to identify them and address their destructive behaviors.\"\n\nLencioni urges: Don't hire unless you and your team members can positively affirm a three-for-three person. I know. It's not easy, but read the book, and you'll be absolutely convinced.\n\nLencioni packs the last 60 pages with highly practical insights, warnings, and next steps. He lists very practical ways to assess your current team members and what to do with the 0-for-3, 1-for-3, and 2-for-3 people already on your team. He gives solutions, including a helpful self-assessment with 18 questions.\n\nSee you at Starbucks!\n\nP.S. By the way, Andrew Murray’s insights in  Humility  will whack you between your selfies (in just 59 pages): “Humility is the only soil in which the graces root; the lack of humility is the sufficient explanation of every defect and failure.”",
    "Very enlightening .I am a big fan of Patrick Lencioni and his organization always teachings - see 5 Dysfunctions etc Seeing the “ individual “ qualities that he is looking - which are “basic “ qualities but you see that are most definitely needed.Truly the concepts aren’t complicated - but - you still need to SEE it ,, and this book definitely helps you to SEE it !",
    "Essential reading to anyone who wants to build good teams - you may intuitively know what makes a good team player but this book sets it out so it is much easily to understand and implement. Also deals with the sticky problem of those who aren't so good - and who is? I found the format of the book a little to samey as his other books but it is an excellent way of getting the message across so I won't complain too much - those new to Patrick Lencioni should enjoy it.",
    "Amazing book, found it transformed my thinking and shed light onto why a team doesn't work properly and how to address this. Written in a humorous style with plenty of practical examples and materials at the end which are useful.",
    "I already had some on Patrick Lencioni's writing on my shelves when I bought this. He is simply tremendous and I recommend this highly.",
    "Absolutely rubbish of a book. Totally got fooled by the reviews. Rubbish and unhelpful, no idea why this is do highly rated."

    "Good book, but be warned, that part of the method stipulates that you purchase the home upfront in cash. Even if you can't do that, there are great lessons to be learned.",
    "This book provides a pretty straightforward easy to understand explanation of the BRRR method. I didn’t know much about it coming in, but I did have some background on investing and economic/financial terminology. I am also a lawyer that has dealt with real estate. I can imagine this book might be a lot to swallow for some.\n\nEven with my background, the book worked best for me when I started running the numbers myself. I formed an excel and started pretending I bought some houses. Then I started finding properties and running those through the excel. It definitely is not get rich quick. But you can see how over 15-20 years, you can really grow your wealth. (I also started doing test runs. I’d find properties; pretend I bought them; and follow to see if I’d made good choices. You will find that a lot of these properties are targeted by flippers or other investors; when they pop back on the market after the rehab, you can see how much they go for; and if the rehabs were financed, how much they cost).\n\nAs other reviews mention, the book can drag on a bit. But, the nuggets are there, and maybe more importantly, it got me thinking about things I hadn’t considered. It eliminated some of the unknowns. It triggered some thoughts of my own. My wife and I plan on following this model, more or less. We are saving for our first house. Fingers crossed.",
    "David does a fantastic job of simplifying the real estate investing cycle so anyone at any level can understand it. I have 3.5 years of experience and a 17 unit portfolio and still pulled out good nuggets in every chapter. Of which I already knew and it just further cemented my understanding or it was a new process that I will look to implement. All around good stuff!",
    "I really enjoyed this book and the detailed descriptions David laid out along with his analogies. I also read Long distance real estate investing by the author, and got a lot out of both. I’m going to be buying my second property and looking to do a rehab and refinance to get capital out so this was a very helpful read.\n\nI only wish that the book had more examples of the numbers of different deals with how to analyze the refinanced mortgage amounts. I think there where only 1 or 2 ex on the financing PITI and how to analyze the numbers for a good deal before buying and rehabbing but would of liked to see more examples throughout the book since it’s such an important part of the BRRR strategy. And maybe a comparison of doing similar BRRR HELOC.\n\nOverall great book, and highly recommend to anyone interested in real estate investing! Thanks David!",
    "The book has great content about real estate investing but sometimes it’s feels very boring as it’s padded with a lot of buzz words and fluff. Also in some chapters I feel like he gives advice but there are not enough information to practically follow it. I would say this book is a good place to start to learn about real estate investing but I would look for more content before I start investing.",
    "Great book to get started with SF investments. BRRRR method is explained really nice, i would love to checkout more of your books to gain more knowledge. Thanks David!",
    "Great book ! Super helpful , detail to the core, anyone interested in real estate investing ! Training and the how To, this is the book ! David green has his bigger pockets podcast which is out of this world , the dude knows his trade that is for sure!

Superb well written ona language that we can understand,I will definitely buy more books from him. Thanks and get this book ! You won’t be disappointed :)",
    "Real estate authors are authors. You will find fundamentals though.",
    "Read this book 1st before you invest in any other property book or training. Although aimed at the US market, the strategy applies to the UK. I have attended a number of training and even been on mentoring property programs, this book put everything together. The book contains very clear examples of traditional method vs BRRRR method, show you why the strategy works. It also talk about building team and recommends ways to build your team, things to look out for. What an excellent book, the best £ I have spend on property training.",
    "Very informative book a must read book for those who want to start and those already in the real estate industry . Also very practical examples on when to invest and how to invest, market studies and factors affecting real estate investment.This book is practical in any given economy .",
    "Apart from the heavy handed baseball anecdotes towards the end, I actually got fed up about 20 pages before the end, relevant to any property cycling and well enough written to be interesting.",
    "Not a huge fan of the writing style but this is a half way decent read. Some good info but this is incredibly oversimplified. Surprise surprise the author makes more $ off coaching / podcasts/ speaking than real estate. Leveraging the way it is described in this book is not advised. Thousands have now been stuck with high rate hard money loans because its not exactly easy to “just refinance!”.\n\nDue diligence. Perform it on who you take advice from just as thoroughly as any real estate investment. This guy is all hat no cattle.",
    "By far the best book on investing in real estate I have ever bought. I can not recommend it enough. It made me completely change the way I used to view real estate investing and I cant do anything but talk and think about real estate investing using the BRRRR method"

    "This book contains a thorough description of what is needed to conduct meetings in a timely, efficient, professional, and inclusive manner. It lets you know what to and not to do. Thanks 😊 😊 😊",
    "Everything",
    "I have been the secretary for a few small clubs for years and they all followed \"Roberts Rules of Order.\" How many people have actually read it though? Still voting the accept the treasurers report? No you haven't! This book is 7x5x1.5 inches so it will fit easily into a briefcase or messenger bag. It's easy to thumb through and find what you need with the well laid out contents in the from of the book and the index at the back. There are also tables in the back that are easy to use. My old tired eyes would do better with a larger book with larger print, but then it would be the size of a big city phone book. If I have to explain what that is you're probably too young to be running a meeting!",
    "Exactly what I was looking for",
    "Ease of downloading to my Kindle app on my phone for quick reference when needed. Also easy to look up subjects and understand them.",
    "I was able to pass my parliamentarian quiz and now I am more knowledgeable about the rules and procedure of my chapter. Before I brought this I would stumble and get lost in motions, but now I am so much more knowledgeable.",
    "At the end of every section I'm panting wondering what's going to happen next. A real page-turner!",
    "",
    "Let's be honest. There are very few people on the face of the Earth who really WANT to read Robert's Rules of Order. But it's a venerable treatise on parliamentary law and constitutes the baseline parliamentary rule book for a blindingly wide array of civil organisations. So if you MUST read Robert's, let's pause a moment to THANK GOD that the Guardians of RRO have at long last decided to make an electronic version of the current edition of the work available at a normal cost. At last, it's possible to carry a version on one's laptop, tablet, or phone! At last, it's possible to conduct a full text search of the entire work! At last, it's super-easy to interpret and... oh wait. Scratch that last one. Although the editors do their best, it's still a fiddle to figure out. I suppose 2 out of 3 ain't bad. Until somebody can develop an AI to read it for us (coming soon, in the 26th Century) going all-electronic is the best innovation this work has seen in a long time. The long-departed General Robert would (I hope) be proud.",
    "this s the real Roberts rules of Order for 2020 and probably the next 10 year. don't even suggest to uy another one\nOr maybe the Roberts rules in brief third edition (the companion introduction)\nit is massive but on a kindle weights nothing what is not to like?",
    "I needed this update as part of my governance work with a not-for-profit organisation that I volunteer with. As a reference work, I need to look up things rather than read it from beginning to end. Unhappy about looking up things on my Kindle reader or app for my mobile. But using Amazon's Kindle for PC app, I can easily find what I want and look at it on screen alongside a document that I'm reviewing or a Zoom I'm taking part in.",
    "Essential reading and reference for anyone involved in formal business meetings for companies, societies, clubs, fellowships etc",
    "This was just what I was looking for. A few changes from the previous edition but no many. I found it to be better laid out that the 11th edition. The most important section was the suggestions of how to conduct an electronic meeting."

    "This is a must have book (information) that outlines sensible financial behaviors and strategies that as the title says, “ordinary people” can follow to build wealth. You can come from nearly any walk of life and still make use of this plan with great success. I only wish I had found Dave and this information years ago. I did end up following his plan ….but was having to figure things out the hard way or by trial and error and could have saved myself lots of time and wasted effort if I was armed with Dave’s strategies early on.\n\nI have purchased multiple copies of “Baby Steps” for my kids… to help them get started on sound footing, armed with a great plan. Please do yourself and family members or friends a favor by getting and using this vital financial information.",
    "Dave’s insights to saving and spending money really work, as I have implemented them in my life and have been much better off because of that. He does talk about the “Baby Steps” to build wealth, which he discusses in most of his books, but in this book he focuses on the unique characteristics that millionaires have which have helped them get to where they are at and sustain / grow their wealth in life. He offers several examples of real people who have built wealth and achieved the millionaire status. In addition to wealth building principles, Dave discusses the spiritual aspects of managing money from a Christian perspective and tries to debunk myths that “money is evil” and “Christians should not be wealthy” by offering a more complete interpretation of certain scriptures.\n\nI believe this is a practical book for anyone looking to cultivate a better attitude toward money and better process for managing their money.",
    "Great read, motivating and inspiring. Makes you think it IS reachable, becoming a millionaire. Would definitely recommend to anyone, easy read.",
    "Glad I picked it up… All of these financial philosophies and gurus out there and this one just hits home. Nothing like practical, stick to it, no gimmick consistent work that is guaranteed to work. Not to mentioned it is backed by the biggest study on America’s millionaires in the last 20 years. Great book",
    "I bought it for my millennial daughter I’m hoping some of the information sinks in because it’s valuable",
    "Ramsey’s “Babysteps Millionaires” is basically a brochure to sell you his previous books, promote his daughter’s books, and to have you and your church buy his “Financial Peace University”.\n\nHe sells books and talks on the radio. His “guests” are preselected… they all have high paying jobs and softball questions.\n\nI find his methods and research questionable and skewed.",
    "I got this for my wife birthday, she looks it‼️",
    "Dave gives solid advice. He’s been there…..done that and bought the t-shirt!!!! God truly blessed him.",
    "This is a system anyone could follow at any age. The only downside is that some advice only applies to America\nHowever the method and principals outlined could work in on the moon and I only wish this could be taught to teenagers before the credit card and store card sellers get to them offering easy credit that has them bound for years\n\nI fully intend to buy a copy of this book for all the teenagers in my family\n\nThank you Mr Ramsey",
    "This was a complete waste of money. All it is, save $1,000., pay off debt, save 6 months of living expenses and invest. Complete waste.",
    "If you've heard anything about or from Dave Ramsey and Ramsey Solutions then this book isn't for you, because you will have heard it all already. Its mainly stories from Ramsey followers with the sprinkling of the Baby Steps philosophy and the Everyday Millionaire research they did.",
    "It is hard to rate this book with stars. I agree with most one stars and five stars reviews at the same time. It all comes to this:\n\na) if you are familiar with Dave's teaching and writing, this book will be a huge disappointment if you are expecting to read something new. Some sections are almost verbatim parts of his previous books. The National Study of Millionaires will be new only if you haven't read Chris Hogan's Everyday Millionaires. If you have, it's an identical material.\n\nb) if you are not familiar with Dave's teaching and are interested in it, this book would be a good place to start in my opinion, because it is a synopsis of his previous books and principles he teaches. It will give you a decent overview without having to read all of his books.",
    "I love Dave Ramsey content but this book was disappointing. It wasn't a practical guide as much as a book convincing you that it's ok to be a millionaire and you're not a bad person if you are one. If you listen to his radio show and have read other books made by the Ramsey group, you want find any revolutionary material in this one. If you need convincing that it's ok to be a millionaire, this book is for you."

    "Si te interesa la filosofía, la superación personal, quieres alcanzar el éxito o simplemente buscas sabiduría a través de la historia, este libro es para ti.\n\nEl autor expone 48 leyes que se pueden aplicar a prácticamente cualquier campo de la vida, bajo contextos históricos reales e interpretaciones que dan mucho que pensar.\n\nAl principio uno puede pensar que este libro es para crear personas ruines y crueles, sin embargo, eso solo ocurre si el lector lleva las leyes al extremo. En realidad, este libro rebosa de sabiduría y nos permite desenvolvernos mejor en el día a día, ya sea en el trabajo o en las relaciones humanas.",

    "Great way to help your children transition into high school as well as college.",
    "I bought this due to a class requirement which includes the access code. I do all my reading on kindle so I don't necessarily regret the purchase, but it did not come with the access code for the assessment. Keep in mind if you buy the kindle version you will have to purchase an access code separately.",
    "This is such a wonderful tool for helping young people understand their own pedagogical (or VoTech)desires. The qualities that are cataloged helped the college bound young adults that I am mentoring reflect on their short lives, on behaviors and quirks and odd feelings they had around peers, and grasp new insights into their own perspective towards education. Finding out that you highly value a small set of traits that most other people don’t value in the same way can be uniquely powerful for them, since only a few people on the planet share that strengths profile in the same order of passion, and can help them understand their perspective and deep values, and help them understand the needs of their fellow community members at a much more resonant level. The non college bound protégé is my favorite, because he embodies the final verse of “Golddigger” by Kanye ft. J.Foxx- “he got that ambition baby, look in his eyes, this week he sweeping floors, next week it’s the fries”. He has zero desire for college but his Achiever and Responsibility means that he can reach a pretty good life by pursuing his current passion for food and service.",
    "To start, I'm annoyed that I had to purchase this book for a required course for my undergraduate degree. For one, I think the class is a waste of money, two, this doesn't bring a lot to the table for older people who already have established careers and probably took personality testing like this at some point for their job.\n\nThat being said, I wish I had just purchased the code to take the test, I would have saved a few bucks. There's really not a whole lot of substance once you get past taking the assessment. It's not going to tell you what you should be when you grow up, or how to achieve success or greatness, it's mainly just for self-awareness.\n\nAnd with that, there are so many great online resources and personality tests for free, all it takes is a few minutes to look them up. And they can provide more information for you beyond what this book can provide. I think this would be good for a high schooler, maybe as preparation for attending college. Just to see, what kind of person am I what is going to motivate me.\n\nIt's not a terrible book, I think I'm probably just above the age range for it to be helpful to me.",
    "This was a great book to read I learn a lot about myself from taking the quiz and reading about how I can strengthen my skills! Highly recommended!",
    "The Clifton strengths finder has been a great addition to my team at work and interesting to play with in my family as well. Apples don’t fall far from the trees as it turns out!",
    "I bought the used version to save some money (college struggles ;). The book is in great shape overall and if I had just bought it for leisure reading it would be PERFECT. Unfortunately, for class, I have to have the unique, one-time use access code in the back of the book. Apparently you use it online for a strength assessment. As seen in the photos, the online code in my book was already used when it arrived. Just be aware that if you're buying the book for a class you'll probably need to get a NEW BOOK. I have to return this one now and get a new one now.",
    "Interesting book, only thing is the assessment only does the top 5 strengths instead of all.",
    "Muy buena guía para conocerse y para desarrollar las fortalezas que harán la diferencia en el futuro. sin duda lo recomiendo tanto a estudiantes como a maestros que hagan funciones de tutor y de orientación a los estudiantes en su preparación para triunfar en la vida.",

    "Very useful. They are not only for the specific exam(GMAT) but they help you refreshing your memories from the high school.\n\nI like them.",
    "I’m a Harvard grad, 99% GMAT scorer and professional tutor/coach since 2002. I have taken the GMAT 6 times—including the GMAT online—with personal bests of 770 composite, 50/51 Quant, 48/51 Verbal, 8/8 IR (2 times) and 6.0 AWA (4 times), and I have scored 700+ on every attempt. More importantly, however, I’ve coached hundreds of aspiring business school students to significantly better GMAT scores over the last two decades, including scores as high as 720 (94%), 740 (97%), 760 (99%), 770, 780, and yes, even the elusive perfect 800, with an average score improvement of over 120 points. I’m also the creator of the 5151 Podcast, where I discuss current GMAT issues in great detail, with zero censorship.\n\nThe GMAT Official Guide Bundle 2022, a.k.a. \"OG\" Bundle (currently $56) receives my qualified recommendation because it provides a great source of over 2,000 real GMAT practice questions: approximately 1,900 questions across the 3 books, and an additional 174 \"online exclusive\" questions. It also includes access to an online / mobile version of all the questions in the books, known as the GMAT Official Guide Online Question Bank.\n\nDespite having given this book 5 stars in a row for many years, I’m knocking it down to 4 stars this year, for the simple reason that with zero new questions—as opposed to previous editions that offered about 15% new questions—it’s mostly useless for someone with an older edition of the OG. You should also utilize the free GMAT Club website, which has forum-style explanations to every GMAT question (simply google search the exact wording of your question), because the official explanations in the OG are notoriously lacking.\n\nThat being said, this year's official guide is still entirely useful as a source of paper questions for those who don’t already have a copy of the OG Bundle, since although the GMAT is a computer test, it can still be quite helpful to study and prepare on paper using a physical book.\n\nThe OG Bundle is by far the very best source of GMAT practice questions—especially for Verbal, where real questions are indispensable—but you will likely need another type of study aid to help improve your scores, such as a book, a class, an online self-study program, a private tutor, or a combination of those 4 methods, in addition to self-study. In most cases, GMAT self-study is possible given the many free, public learning resources such as GMAT Club, especially for Quant, but it can become more challenging on Verbal, where the official explanations can be even more confusing than the questions themselves, and the online preparation options are far more limited and lacking.\n\nFor more information, google “GMAT Action Plan—McElroy Tutoring.”",
    "I almost finished the first book in the bundle. It's really comprehensive and helpful for my GMAT prep journey. I am taking my GMAT exam next month, so wish me luck :)",
    "Many people might think you need an extensive course or an expensive study method. And I'm no one to say what works and what doesn't, but I truly believe getting used to the questions you'll see on the test is half the battle (getting over that mental hurdle)\n\nSo these books are definitely a way to get comfortable with looking at and answering these questions, you just need to put in the time",
    "Its OG! enough said",
    "Received my GMAT Official Guide 2022 books a day early in excellent condition. BRAND NEW and no damage to box or books. Unlike the previous reviews, my scratch off code worked!!! I was concerned about that. I have registered and downloaded the \"Wiley Efficient Learning\" App. I 100% recommend ordering from Amazon.\n\nWish me luck!!!",
    "The book is great as far as practice questions. However, if your are refreshing on math topics like myself. The explanations will provide little clarity.",
    "These are good books so far, but the code it gives you to use the app doesn’t work. By that I mean that once you get into the app, there isn’t a way to practice for the gmat",
    "Used this a a study aid and it did the trick. Very happy",
    "The item is sold as “new”. But halfway through, I noticed marks on the practice question pages, which clearly indicates the book has been used! Now I have marked the pages so can’t really return.",
    "I ordered a bundle of books expecting three books, and just received the Official Guide and neither Quant nor Verbal Review ones",
    "It came quicker than expected. Very happy with my purchase.",
    "Everything was great! The codes work!"

The design of this book delivers as something that will facilitate learning for people unfamiliar with EOS. There are summaries at the end of every chapter, and even a couple of new methods shared to help teams doing things like IDS and creating valuable scorecards for their group. My favorite chapter was the one on the People Analyzer and getting feedback because it challenged people to own their development and equips them to lead the feedback conversation with their leader. There are questions throughout that will also help make this a conversation between a leader and their team members. If you are an EOS company this should be part of your onboarding of people and a tool for all your leaders at any level to use with their teams.",

    "According to Steinmetz, Mark Twain wrote, “Jay Gould (1836-1892) was the mightiest disaster which has ever befallen this country…The people had desired money before his day, but he taught them to fall down and worship it.”\n\nSteinmetz himself summarizes, “That’s the thing about Gould. He lied. He cheated. He stole. But he was so good at what he did, so intelligent in the execution, and such a ‘clean, kind, and industrious’ family man that try as you might, you can’t hate him properly.”\n\nFor me, that logic is just a little too tortured. I have to side with Twain. Gould made Gordon Gekko look like a choirboy, although it must be said that a lot of the cheating that Gould brought to Wall Street was perfectly legal at the time.\n\nSteinmetz is a good writer and the book is well researched. I personally found no entertainment value to the story, however. Many people start out in modest circumstances but nonetheless resist the temptations that Gould embraced.\n\nThere is one educational nugget to Gould’s story, however. And that message is the fallacy that the capital markets are capable of managing themselves. “As much as Gould’s career showed the creative power of laissez-faire economics, it also shone a light on its shortcomings and made a mockery of Emerson’s faith in free markets.” Self-restraint is no match for the man or woman determined to acquire wealth for the sake of wealth itself.\n\nFor Gould it was railroads and Western Union. Today, it’s Big Tech. That’s not to suggest that they practice Gould’s methods. The lesson of Gould, however, despite the modicum of regulation that has been put in place since his time – and largely dismantled in recent years – has not been taken to heart.",
    "I had never heard of Jay Gould but his story is a fascinating one. For a story taking place in the mid to late 1800s I thought the book was a great read with enough detail to give the reader insights and tales from an interesting period of US history. Big money controlled big industry and this is a good depiction of the eta",
    "Interesting story about financier, railroad man, Jay Gould, someone who I hadn't heard of before. Really made his mark around and after the Civil War. Complicated from the standpoint on one hand he was smart, worked hard, and was a good family man. On the other hand, he was corrupt in business, didn't have integrity in his dealings, and seemed incredibly focused on money. He financed a number of railroads and helped America grow but he was also involved in a lot of shady speculation deals. His time was a wild time where insider trading was legal and bribery was the mainstream. I'm glad we have moved to a state of more regulated capitalism. While not perfect yet, at its heart, capitalism should give everyone a fair opportunity while incenting those whose creativity pushes society forward. The book was a bit linear and didn't really draw much for conclusions, but all in all, was an interesting and quick read."

    "Most personal development books advocate secret shortcuts to success. The 4-Hour Workweek, an extremely popular title from author Tim Ferriss, detailed strategies for “joining the new rich” and traveling the world by working as little as possible. Cal Newport’s latest book entitled Deep Work by contrast is refreshing in its emphasis on extremely cognitively demanding work as the key to success and personal fulfillment.\n\nDeep Work is defined as “Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.” Deep Work is contrasted with Shallow Work, defined as “Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.” Newport’s thesis is that the ability to actually concentrate on hard stuff is becoming rare due to addictive and distracting technologies from Facebook to Buzzfeed to email. Meanwhile, any job that can be replaced by a computer or someone in a developing nation will be, so deep work is actually more valuable than ever.\n\nDeep Work is the knowledge workers’ version of “deliberate practice,” the sort of which leads to expertise as found by K. Anders Ericsson in studies of violin players, golfers, chess grandmasters, and so on. Sheer number of hours of very challenging practice with the aim to deliberately improve one’s skills correlates with the greatest expertise, hence the \"10,000 hours rule\" popularized by Malcolm Gladwell. Expert violin players practice 3-4 hours a day, whereas mediocre players practice only 1 hour a day or less. Similarly, knowledge workers who spend 30-50% of their work day in completely focused concentration on important, difficult projects produce more value than knowledge workers who spend most of the time checking email, sitting in meetings, and distractedly trying to get a few things done each day.\n\nWhile Newport emphasizes the benefits in productivity and job security from Deep Work, I think the real benefits are in meaningfulness and life satisfaction. Newport has given a name to something vague I’ve felt was missing in my life. Now I not only have the vocabulary to talk about it, but also a model of how to live a deeply meaningful life in a sustainable manner.\n\nI’ve had a belief that to do a high volume of good quality work, it was necessary to be a workaholic, a belief supported by the exemplars of high achievement in my life. Not wanting to experience the obvious negative effects of workaholism, I’ve instead chosen to be a slacker. Newport presents a golden mean between the extremes of workaholism and slacking, activity and rest; that of spending 3 or 4 hours a day sequestered in highly concentrated periods of challenging mental labor, 90-120 minutes at a stretch, never working after 5:30pm, and managing all this by ruthlessly eliminating the inessential.\n\nThis is a noble use of ruthlessness, versus Tim Ferriss’ ethic of ruthlessly cheating-within-the-rules or exploiting international labor markets for personal gain. The inessential ought to be eliminated; doing so ensures room for deep and important work. While Ferriss sometimes talks about eliminating the inessential, he frequently contradicts himself by recommending many unimportant things like expensive and needless supplements, or worthless accomplishments like setting a “world record” for number of tango spins in 1 minute, or cheating at kickboxing. Ferriss emphasizes laziness (“the 4 hour X”) and hacks that allow one to skirt effort, while Newport advocates hard, hard work for which there is no shortcut.\n\nUltimately Newport’s Deep Work is not simply about doing better work, it’s about living a better life, balancing many competing priorities, determining which technologies aid your most important labor, and valuing your energy and your time as the precious and non-renewable resources they are.\n\nThis book a must-read for anyone who does knowledge work of any kind and wants to live a meaningful life in our age of distraction.\n\nThat said, this book leaves me with some questions.\n\nDeep Work is a book about finding meaning through work as well as success in life in Late Capitalism. The proposed solution to being outsourced or automated in a hyper-competitive global marketplace is to become indispensable by practicing in a way that leads to profound expertise. However, most new jobs in the economy are in the service sector. Quite a few service jobs won’t allow for Deep Work, for example Starbucks baristas, Amazon warehouse workers, Bus/Uber drivers, call center employees, administrative assistants, and so on. Do these workers have any opportunities to practice Deep Work on the job in a way that cannot be commodified?\n\nNewport at one point suggests that these entry-level jobs do not, therefore the worker should develop deeper skills to increase their opportunities for deep work. But when and where can a service industry worker develop their skills, especially if they are already working full-time or more? The best time to develop skills is while you are being paid, and Newport advocates not doing anything work related after 5:30pm. It seems that the only way for such a person to get ahead would be to add an additional 3-4 hours of deep work into their schedule on top of their 8+ hours on the job, but this would necessarily lead to lower cognitive performance from overwork and inferior rest. Since expertise is about total hours spent in deep work or deliberate practice, an economy where the deepest workers thrive rewards the privileged.\n\nAlso by definition if rockstars are some of the only people in a field who will thrive, the system is inherently unjust, privileging a tiny minority while the overwhelming majority suffers. Is Deep Work only for the 1%, and therefore the 99% are destined to lead meaningless and shallow lives? Will Deep Work counter the trend towards increasing inequality, or will it further this disturbing phenomenon, or neither? Is there a way we can increase the opportunities for Deep Work for all workers, not just the professional elite?\n\nShallow Work is defined as basically busy work that presents a veneer of being productive, whereas Deep Work is the opposite: focusing on very cognitively demanding work that is personally and socially important. But some of the examples of Deep Work involve very showy displays of work such as number of published papers or (I imagine) lines of code written. Everyone knows it is easier to write 5 shallow books than one truly deep one. Could one be a better researcher by publishing fewer, higher quality papers? Does “publish or perish” really create better academic institutions? Does number of published papers make for a good researcher or professor? Does number of citations even make for a good paper?\n\nMany paradigm-changing papers or works were ignored at first. As physicist Max Plank allegedly said, \"Science progresses one funeral at a time.\" Is high craftsmanship always valued and appreciated in a field, or do other values make something more popular or financially lucrative? For instance, a better program might be one which is more elegant, requiring fewer lines of code to do the same thing. But lines of code is a showy metric that appears to be better, despite being more shallow. While Newport's official \"lead\" metric for success is hours spent in deep work, he also emphasizes the metric of number of academic papers published. Newport’s previous books were on academic success, which is largely defined as getting straight A’s in difficult classes. Is Deep Work just trying to get an “A” in life, or is it truly working on what is important, even if one is not rewarded externally as much as the person who plays to the crowd/rules? Is it “he who dies with the most published and cited papers wins?” or is it “he who writes the most meaningful and deep papers wins?” What if the crowd's values for success in your field are wrong or shallow?\n\nIs Deep Work actually deep, or is it merely technical? It seems like many of the examples involve learning a highly specialized technical discipline, and/or perhaps inventing something new in a highly specialized technical discipline. But is technical skill and proficiency what truly matters in life? To take the example of masterful musicians who K. Anders Ericsson studied: is mastery in musical performance merely a matter of technical proficiency? Clearly without technical proficiency, one cannot reach a level of mastery in music, so some high degree of technical proficiency is necessary. But just as clearly, musical performance that only contains technical mastery is missing something equally as important, making this technical ability insufficient. Newport’s previous book was about developing skill instead of following your passion, but a technical musician who lacks passion makes for a cold and unmoving performance. Is Newport underestimating the importance of passion or heart in expertise because it is more challenging to measure or teach?\n\nI know several people who are back in school right now. All of them spend many hours a day studying very cognitively demanding material in a highly focused manner, but none are superstars. Why is this? One (my wife) doesn’t even have a Facebook or Twitter account, and studies in a very focused manner for hours at a time, and yet is still very slow compared to her son, who can write a nearly good paper in literally 1/10th the time. (He plays hours of video games every day.) Is she lacking some crucial study skill? Another is a PhD candidate in the biological sciences and basically works round the clock. Why isn’t she a superstar in her field given her long hours of difficult study? (She is doing well, but not head-and-shoulders above similar PhD students.) Is she not resting enough or focused enough while she works? Hours spent in a highly focused manner on cognitively demanding tasks is clearly an important thing, but also clearly not the only relevant variable in producing outstanding results. What are those other factors that determine extreme results and are they learnable?\n\nIs Deep actually compatible with More and Fast? In this book, Newport emphasizes being able to produce high volume of work quickly in order to survive and thrive in Late Capitalism. But does this emphasis on More and Fast sacrifice some level of depth that is only possible with Less and Slow? For example, in the psychological sciences as well as in pharmaceutical drug trials, it is difficult to get funding for longitudinal studies that track individuals over long periods of time, but deep and important information is found from these studies that cannot be replicated through short-term studies alone. Because of the lack of these studies (and their expense), we have lots of data on short-term effects of drugs but little information about the effects of these drugs after years of use…and many of these drugs continue to be used for years, such as SSRIs and other anti-depressant drugs. Deep Work does seem to eliminate much of what is unimportant, specifically mindless entertainment and needless technology. A life of Deep Work is certainly more focused and meaningful than one without. There are also some advantages to More and Fast. But what other Deep things are we missing out on by focusing on More and Fast work?\n\nDespite my questions, I found the book very moving and important, and I highly recommend it. In my own life, I will be seriously considering ways to make my daily work life revolve around as much Deep Work as I can sustain.",
    "Deep Work is the execution/tactical companion to Newport's last book, So Good They Can't Ignore You and it doesn't disappoint.\n\nThese books should be taken together as a whole because they give you the WHAT, the WHY and the HOW for being an elite knowledge worker.\n\nSo Good they Can't Ignore you shows you why building valuable and rare skills, which Newport calls \"career capital\" is the number one most important thing for finding a job you love (not \"finding your passion\"). Building that capital allows you to find a job where you can have creative control over your work and more control over your time, which allows you to do \"deep work,\" aka deliberate practice (and the 10,000 hour rule for expertise, Gladwell, Ericsson and others). There are also 2 other factors, choosing a domain or mission or project where you will have a postive impact on the world, and choosing to work with people who you like being around, which aren't covered much but Newport assumes you should be able to figure out on your own.\n\nSummary of what you need to be So Good They Can't Ignore You\n\n1. Rare and valuable skills (aka career capital)\n2. Creative control over projects\n3. Control over your time (which allows you to do deep work, virtuous cycle)\n4. Work that has a positive impact on the world\n5. Working with people you enjoy being with\n\nHere's the formula:\n\n-Use deep work to learn fast and build up rare and valuable skills.\n-Then apply these rare and valuable skills to the right projects so that you can build up career capital.\n-Then cash in the career capital to get more creative and time control over your job.\n-All the while, try to pick jobs and projects that have a positive impact and allow you to work with good people.\n-However, these are usually also things that you need to trade in your career capital (rare skills and experience using them) in order to maximize.\n-Don't try to save the world or have a big impact until you have the career capital to match. Otherwise you will probably fail. You have to earn all these perks via building career capital by using deep work.\n\nSo Good They Can't Ignore You doesn't spend much time explaining how to actually implement deep work (deliberate practice) into you life. It tells you to focus deeply, stretch yourself cognitively and get constant high quality feedback on your work/output.\n\nThat's where Deep Work comes in. Deep Work shows you exactly WHY deep work is so important (as opposed to Shallow Work), especially for modern knowledge workers, and why the way most people work, with constant interruptions from social media, email and their phones, is holding most knowledge workers back from being successful and competitive in today's job market.\n\nThe first part of the book argues for why Deep Work is important. If you have already bought into the idea, you can skim this part, but I found the examples and people he featured to be very interesting so it's worth a read. Just don't expect a lot of tactics until part 2.\n\nChapter 1 explains why deep work is VALUABLE. Our economy is changing, and the days of doing the same thing over and over for 40 years until you retire are over. Newport lays out an interesting theory for 3 types of workers, Superstars, Owners and High Skill Workers and makes a convincing and important argument for the importance in the future of being able to work at higher levels of abstraction and work with intelligent machines.\n\nIn this chapter he also makes a case for the two critical skills for knowledge workers:\n1. Learning Quickly\n2. Producing at an Elite Level\n\nThis conclusion informs the rest of the book. If you want to be good at these two skills, the most important thing to be good at is deep work.\n\nChapter 2 focuses on why deep work is RARE. He shows how distractions are becoming more and more common for knowledge workers, and that attention is becoming more and more fractures. Newport makes a good case for how complex knowledge work is often hard to measure, so managers measure busyness instead of output that relates to bottom line results (KPIs). Busyness as a vanity metric. People end up optimizing for looking busy instead of getting real work done, and everybody plays along with this charade.\n\nChapter 3 goes into why deep work is MEANINGFUL. Meaning is a key part of Newport's argument because the whole book links back to the Passion vs. Rare Skills debate…which is a better strategy for finding a job you love? If the job isn't meaningful, then deep work doesn't fully answer the question of how to best find a job you love. Newport give 3 theories on why deep work is meaningful, a psychological, neurological and a philosophical reason.\n\nThat's it for part 1.\n\nIn Part 2, Newport tells you how to implement deep work into your day to day life with 4 rules.\n\nRule 1 gives you a bunch of strategies and examples of how to integrate deep work into your schedule. He offers different strategies depending on what kind of work you do. The Grand Gestures part of this chapter is really good, you learn about Bill Gates Think Week and same famous authors who go to secluded islands or build cabins to get a lot of deep work done when necessary. There is also a section here on execution using the 4 Disciplines from Clayton Christensen's work. The point on lead vs. lag measures is really good.\n\nRule 2 covers the idea of embracing boredom. Newport gives a number of strategies for doing two important things: improving your ability to focus and eliminating your desire for distraction. At first these seem like the same thing but Newport explains why they are actually two different skills. For example, someone who is constantly switching between social media and infotainment sites can block off time for deep work but they won't be able to focus if they can't control their desire to always have instant gratification and constant stimulus. The point about making deep work your default, and scheduling shallow work in between is also a game changer.\n\nRule 3 is about social media sites and infotainment sites. This rule isn't as strategic as the other ones, it's mostly about making a side argument that these networking sites aren't as important is you think they are. He gives some good strategies for measuring what sites and services you should include in your day to day life based on the total collection of all the positive and negative effects. This sort of critical thinking and measurement usually doesn't get applied to these kind of sites.\n\nRule 4 is about draining the shallows, meaning going through the process of eliminating as much as possible shallow work from your daily schedule. This is more tactical chapter, (This and Rule 1 are the most useful of the 4) you learn how to plan out your day, how to stop from bringing your work home with you with an end of day ritual and how to manage your email so that you cut down on the amount of time you spend in your inbox each day. There is also a strategy for how to talk to your boss about deep work so you can get permission to re-arrange your schedule to be more productive.\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nThis book, and Newport's previous book So Good They Can't Ignore You, are some of the most important books you will read on planning your career.\n\nMost people spend little to no time on these decisions, or just go with the flow or with how other people approach things, even though this planning process will affect the next 4 to 5 decades of their life.\n\nMost people's thinking is still stuck in the industrial economy way of thinking…it makes sense thought, our education system is also stuck in this way of thinking. Deep work gives you a solid, actionable plan and doesn't leave anything out that I can think of.",
    "This was quite an inspiring but challenging read. Not challenging in the sense of difficult - the book is very-well written and flows easily - but it goes against the grain of so many current social and work habits and fads. In this reader at least, the book did provoke quite a profound sense of loss when I realized what I could and did achieve earlier in my life against what my current distracted self can achieve. The book falls into two broad sections: the first is the why - why deep work is good but why it doesn't happen; the second is the how - tips to make deep work happen in your life, with very different approaches depending upon the nature of one's life and work.\nThe book does point out that deep work genuinely isn't for everyone - for different but related reasons, CEOs of huge corporations and carers of young children might be better off entirely working at the 'shallow' level. However, it does make excellent points about how routine administration, productivity checks and social discourse, especially using social media, are vampires of time and attention like nothing else. As well as being very useful for individuals, many managers could usefully read this book, to help empower workers to achieve more of real value and - and this point is not unrelated - stop constantly harassing them with administrative requests of little or no real importance. One important facet of this is it shows very persuasively how deep work is almost the opposite of long work, or overwork - working better decreases working time overall, with much better results. For employees, and intelligent employers, what is not to like about that? It really chimed in with my experiences in the organized working environment.\nSo highly recommended for anyone interested in how to work better on an individual level, or how work might be done better on an organizational level. I suppose I can't say better than that I actually made one set of the recommended changes immediately on finishing the book...",
    "Author drags one or two points out into a whole book of filler. Keeps repeating the same points, backing them up with dragged out character stories and pseudo science. Very American writing style where everything is sensationalized and lacking in real substance.\nI bought it after reading the kindle sample. If you've read the kindle sample, you've read the whole book - nothing else is added.",
    "I'm a self-improvement junkie who hates self-help books. Most self-help books (if not all) masquarades poor advice and wishful thinking as a path to self-progress. Every now and then I torture myself reading self-help books to reinforce my above thoughts about self-help books. Luckily I came across this book as strong recommendation from a twitter account which I really value a lot. And I'm glad that I took the recommendation.\n\nDeep Work is a common sense book than a self-help book. The crux of the book is that there are two kind of work we do. One is Deep work and the other is shallow work. Deep work is rare and hard. Shallow work is easy and ubiquitous.\n\nWhat is Deep Work? Deep work is concentrating on a cognitively demanding work with zero distractions to produce quality work. Its demanding and helps provide valuable things to society that are hard to replicate or replace.\n\nWhat Shallow work? Any work we do on auto-pilot. Replying emails , social media presence etc. These work are easy to replace and not valued much in society.\n\nThe book is dividend into two parts. Part I is about why Deep work matter and its scientific backing. Part II is how to achieve Deep work.\n\nPart I doesn't have to try hard to convince us about the internet chipping away our ability to concentrate and contemplate. And provides all the necessary studies and research on internet and its effects on attention. Most of the critique are well ground and rational, and definitely not a luddite rant on the internet.\n\nPart II is how to achieve Deep Work.\n\nDiscusses on what type of Deep work philosophy to choose.\nRitualising Deep work: Identify Location and time to do deep work. Adhere to rules and process to deep work. (like no internet)\n4DX fundamentals: Focus unimportant things, Act on measures, Keep a scorecard, Create accountability.\nEmbrace Boredom:Don't take break from distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus. Schedule your internet usage. Structure your deep thinking.\nQuit Social Media.\nDrain the Shallows: Schedule your day in blocks in advance to focus on Deep work.\n\nAlthough it follows the typical science/self-help format with familiar paragraphs like 'The Study conducted by University of X researchers on group of people in Y of the age Z in ABC environment agrees with my thesis', this is a potent work with strong common sense solutions to the ubiquitous problem of shallow work. My thoughts on self-help books remains unchanged. However I would highly recommend this book.",
    "Genre: Productivity | Creativity | Hacks | Self Development | Business\nRating : 5/5\n\nDeep work is a book for everyone although the author emphasises it for knowledge workers. In my opinion it is for businessmen who wants to achieve their goals in their hectic schedule, teachers (faculties) who wants to pursue research despite their academic duties, or an entrepreneur who wants to increase the productivity and creativity of the team, or just some random guy who wants to spend some quality time with family but cannot. Books helps you to develop self discipline.\nThis book can best be placed among books like Outliers/Mastery/Flow/Peak etc. where importance of work and it’s consequences are explained. Only thing is Deep work is more detailed in terms of strategies and bit less on psychology studies.\nThe book is hardly 300 pages but will require some time to fully understand all hacks & strategies. Work habits of great people like Carl Jung, J K Rowling, Bill Gates, Walter Isaacson and many others are very well explained. The author also writes about his life and experience.\nAfter reading this book you will definitely be more productive, you might be able schedule every minute/hour/day of your life, you would be able to effectively choose your career job and not fall for dead end jobs, and lastly decipher what is fact from fiction when it comes to big companies.\n\nAfter completing this book and from my experience at different work places I think the book may be a bit ambitious for developing & undeveloped countries. This is because I think in this countries there is still lack of work ethics and your company/institute may not respond as the book says or they may not even consider deep work as meaningful. All in all deep work gives a positive experience.",
    "I have read a lot of books on personal development and self help, most of them useless. This however is a true gem. I put it in the top 5 most useful books I have ever read. It is a great treatise on how to produce high quality work, and is becoming more relevant by the day (with our increasingly distracted world). I feel sorry for kids you are already addicted to their smartphones by age 10.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone, and it has wide relevance across many fields. Also very readable and entertaining. It is a joy to read and has plenty of interesting tales and case studies to make the book flow perfectly, whilst imparting the necessary wisdom."

    "This is the first book I have finished, probably in my adult life and definitely in the last 10yrs. Normally I skip through the books finding bits and pieces that catch my interest before losing interest. Now each morning I wake up and I'm excited to sit down and read The Miracle Morning and practice the Life S.A.V.E.R.S.\n\nWhy is The Miracle Morning different? It has inspired me to be the successful entrepreneur I had always envisioned I would be \"someday.\" Not there yet, but I expect to be in 90 days. All along deep inside I knew I would most likely fail at this too, since that's how I viewed everything I had attempted to do in my life. I was afraid of failure, so if I didn't try I couldn't fail. Right?\n\nHal shared all his real life traumatic and life altering experiences, failures and devastating financial set backs. Which I could relate to on a personal level. If Hal could go thru all that which is similar to my life experiences and he come out the other side more successful and found an even greater amount of financial freedom, then I could to. \"If\" I implemented all of the steps that enabled Hal to not only reach his goals but exceed his own expectations of those goals. Just like the restaurant scene from \"When Harry met Sally\", I looked at Hal's life and said to myself, \"I want what Hal is having.\"\n\nThe book made me go deep within myself and ask myself why did I fail? Basically it is what I would tell myself right before I would embark on a new job, a promise to a friend or family member that I would do something or be somewhere, my core being would say, \"you know you won't follow through.\" My stomach would clench and I would fell sick inside. This would be followed by extreme guilt because I didn't follow through on anything. Then my inner voice would say, \"see I told you, you wouldn't do it!\" \"You are such a failure. You can't stick to your word or promises.\"\n\nThis book has changed that mind set. Now I don't tell myself \"I will\", instead I tell myself, \"I am\". When I journal I write, I am successful, I visualise myself being successful, what that feels like and last but not least how I am going to execute it. I visualise each and every step of the way. How those steps are going to make me feel. No more commitment issues. Those are not allowed! No excuses either . Those are replaced with accountability. No more self hate. Hate has been replace with self love, confidence, peace, joy and freedom. Like I said at the beginning, The Miracle Morning is a life changer!\n\nI am going back to what my mother instilled in me from childhood and throughout my adult life which I had lost some where along the way. Mom: \"Amy, you can do and be anything you want to do or be in the whole wide world. You are beautiful, intelligent, funny, strong, people like being around you and people love you. All you have to do is put your mind to it. Remember it's mind over matter! If you believe you can then you can, BUT if you don't believe you can then you won't. It's all yours for the taking...all you have to do is go out and get it.\" What she left out was the \"how to's\" how to set a goal and most importantly what actions need to be taken to reach and exceed my own expectations. Hal not only gives you the confidence that you can but he also gives you a plan of action. An action plan which will help you to execute those actions to reach your own level of success you've ever imagined but never knew quite how to get there. These steps can apply to any and every aspect of your life.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\n\nThank you Hal for your transparency and sharing your life experiences from the good, bad, happy, sad, triumphs and tribulations with the world. Because of you, now I am experiencing things I only dreamed of but never imagined it being my reality. Thank you Hal for the gift that keeps on giving. It's feels like Christmas morning 24/7.\n\nWith much love and gratitude,\nAmy",
    "The first segment of this book is a retelling of his \"great life to near death to great life to financial ruin to great life\" story (which was published before his \"great life to rare cancer to great life\" chapter.) I'll give him this: he is superbly adaptive to his circumstances, and God bless him for that. But the core notion that life SHOULD be lived, MUST be lived, at 100% in order to have an exceptional, happy, fulfilled life is utter bunk.\n\nI like Tony Robbins' approach--live life with passion. Absolutely. But to think that most humans are living in mediocrity completely invalidates (not to mention judges) how others find happiness. I know people who live to fish, that being out on the water every weekend is what they live for. Some of them even make their living fishing. Are they living their lives to their full potential? Who knows? Are they happy? They say they are, so who are we to say that's a life of mediocrity?\n\nI know a guy who lives like Hal Elrod describes--full on, all the time, super successful, incredibly rich. The guy called me the other day drunk, sobbing, completely unhinged because he is so desperately unhappy, being unable to process his father's dying and the neglect he experienced as a child. Millionaire. Living full blast. Suicidal.\n\nWhat seems to be missing from Mr Elrod's treatise is a broader view of what a truly successful life includes. I am capable of a ton more than what I'm doing right now. But I've lived in the spotlight, I've made my mark in my area of military psychiatry through public speaking and published articles. But I am happier now than I ever was back then. I work quietly without fanfare, explore back roads, hike when the weather is good, visit family and friends as time allows, read new books on my occasional day off, and attend as much good theater as possible.\n\nFor me, getting up early is not so I can do all the things that will maximize my potential. It's to leisurely make a cup of coffee, sit and enjoy it while I watch the sky lighten, make the bed (maybe), and a couple of times a week, head over to my community YMCA and enjoy the fellowship of an accepting, nonjudgemental community while I do whatever my body thinks would feel good. That is joy.\n\nCould I do more? Yep. But I have no need to. I'm intellectually stimulated every day at my job, spiritually enriched within my religious community, in the peak of health at 60 years old, despite these unpleasant 20# I have gained these past 5 years, and think I have a pretty fabulous life, especially in comparison to 80% of the rest of the planet.\n\nBerating myself for not doing as much as I am physically, intellectually, and emotionally capable (which Mr Elrod's unwavering message would lead some to do, I think) is the opposite of living a grateful, fulfilling life. So I can't endorse this particular message, although if it's helping others find a path to enrichment, that's great. But this path is definitely not the only, or even the best, path for many of us.\n\nBTW, I have no trouble whatsoever stating my life's purpose: to ease the suffering of whoever is near me at any given moment. Not remove their suffering. Not ease the suffering of every living soul on the planet. Just make each individual feel a little less pain, a little more hope, a little more confident, a little less scared, a little more love. Simple. And achievable. Don't need a book to figure that out.",
    "This book really had me not wanting to put it down which surprised me since I typically don’t read these kinds of books . It’s a must read!!! I think I will read it again ..",
    "This book gave a great breakdown of how to set yourself up for a successful day every day. I really enjoyed it and am excited to get started on my own miracle morning!",
    "Easy to read (is fairly short), has some good stories, and seems to compile what it takes 300-500 pages of several other books to say. In other words, it hits a few key topics quickly and moves on. I could see this being helpful to many people.",
    "Starting tomorrow morning I am going to put the principles of this book into action. Hal Elrod has laid out a blueprint for self improvement that is clear and compelling. I'm jumping in with high expectation due to the difference this plan has made in so many lives.",
    "This is okay. It basically says get up early, prioritise and make sure you take care of yourself. I quite enjoyed it. Don't do it, but I quite enjoyed it.",
    "I started doing my \"Miracle Morning\" TWO YEARS BEFORE I'd heard \"The Miracle Morning\"!!! I started doing it after few audiobooks by Brian tracy. I was already doing 40 minutes run + heavy-weight, 8 minutes meditations, affirmations, journaling, after reading books by Brian Tracy, written 10-20 years before!!! Waking up naturally (without alarm) at 4:30am.\n\nKyosaki wrote review? LOL :) he is making extra affiliate money. Subscribe to the author's podcast, he will interview other authors; subscribe other authors, they will interview him; it is dirty loop. I landed on this book after the watching interview with the author at Mike Dillard website, etc...\n\nThe message in this book is very loud and rebranded, \"Scribing\" instead of \"Journaling\", \"Silence\" instead of \"Meditations\". Author almost killed himself by trying to run (walk) ultramarathon and killing natural body defences (and getting cancer few years later); \"do't try at home\".\n\nIf you listen to Author's so many podcast interviews with other authors... you will notice lie. Can you do SAVERS in 6 minutes in the morning? Stupid idea. 60 seconds exercise? just basic body stretch and warmup should take not less than 10 minutes. This book is not \"actionable\". Advice that humans can sleep 4.5 hours instead of 9 hours is wrong: farmers may be, few hours per day, but chess-players not.\n\nQuoting:\n\"WARNING If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all who claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think everything you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told you should want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned...... \" - Tyler, \"Fight Club\"",
    "I ordered this book in hardcover. But I receive in paperback, and quality of paper & printing is also not good. This type of books are available in out side of railway station in just ₹100. Front cover of this book easily identify books quality is feck.\n\nAmazon delivery is excellent. (5/5)\nContent of book is also excellent. (5/5)\nBut quality of paper, printing disappointed .(0/5)",
    "I read the book cover to back. The content added value to me, I am already planning and applying some of the principles on the book. My 3 stars is due to the extreme repetition of the same information and the overuse of testimonials and filling content. The true value of the book is in about 30 pages (out of 143) and for the most practical parts of the books it sends you to a website to get the guides and how-to's which could have been added in the book.\n\nI personally never read \"summaries\" of books but in this case it made me wish I did.",
    "Best self help book every. I highly recommend it for those who want to change the way of their life and achieve what they want."

    "My gosh. Jenna, you, my dear have truly stretched beyond measure as a human being.\n\nYou bring Jesus to our modern day life and what God desires for us all. Your God given abilities to tune into your path and embrace all of your circumstances, trials and tribulations to move forward are so inspiring.\n\nThis book is insightful, transformational and so hard to put down. I mean wow. The stories are so captivating and the lessons to be learned by many are life changing! I truly believe that every woman needs this book in their hands. As early as 18! Like a must! I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to step into their dream life and go! It’s there, just waiting for you to start with what you have! Go read it now! Like Jenna’s grandpa said “Time flies but you’re the pilot!”\n\n-Maria",
    "Such an incredible book! It’s a beautiful blend of stories, lessons, and actionable tips. The chapters are really well written and easy to read, and it feels as if Jenna is sitting right there talking to you, personally, in her usual compassionate, direct, and heartfelt way.\n\nWhile I got something out of every chapter, one of my favorite lines was “You can press the brake without forgetting where the gas pedal is” (Chapter 12, page 175). In today’s world, where it often feels like there’s pressure to keep trying, keep pushing, and keep working — whether in our careers or personal lives — this resonated deeply. I really appreciate how Jenna is so honest and real, sharing concrete examples from her own life, and how she also shows readers that it’s okay to be different, slow down and do things differently compared to everyone else, and live a life that still feels genuinely meaningful, rewarding, and full.\n\nThere are plenty more passages just like that throughout the entire book, and I love how Jenna gives readers permission (and shows them how!) to step back, check in with themselves, and ask, “How does this feel? Is this right for ME?” and, of course, “How am I really?”\n\nIt’s so full of fantastic reminders and messages, so I know it’s a book I know I’ll come back to over and over again. (I’ve already finished and started it a second time!) So grateful for this book and the insights filling its pages!",
    "If you’re unsatisfied with going through the motions of a fruitless job or feel like there could be something more, do yourself a favor and pick up this book. Chock full of truth, Jenna shares her journey and highlighter-worthy nuggets of wisdom in a book that will challenge you and change you. Having just gone through the first part of the journey and recognizing I was not on the right path, I appreciate her entrepreneurial insights and sharing how she created a new path for herself to find the balance she desired.\nMy favorite part (so far) is how Jenna shifts the reason for boundaries - they’re not to keep people out but keep our lives focused and centered on what we are here for.\nThank you, Jenna, for taking the courageous step and writing a book anyway. I know this will help a lot of people find a more joyful, fulfilling path for their lives.",
    "Like seriously, if you sat quiet with yourself and truly listened to what your definition of success was would it look different than everyone else. Could you start living the life you want now? Those thought-provoking questions and more are what you will discover in this incredible book! Jenna does it again! Always asking us the questions we are not eager to ask ourselves. Not only will the book ask the tough questions it will also provide you a roadmap to how you can start living your truth right now. If you love her podcast, I highly recommend checking out the audiobook! Jenna does a great job sharing her story! So what are you waiting for? Go check it out!",
    "This book is all the feels! Male, female, single, married, divorced, parent, CEO, small business owner, stay at home parent, LGBTQIA+, you name it, this book is for everyone! I didn’t even realize how much of my life I’ve been missing. As someone in corporate America, I’ve been stuck in the grind, the last 2+ years I’ve immersed myself into “WFH” which for me has meant no separation between work and life. This book has opened my eyes, reinvigorated me to take control of my life, to stop and ask myself “How are you, REALLY”, to give space for people to really share how they are, to find the joy, and really experience the joy. Thank you Jenna, for sharing yourself with the world!",
    "This is how the book made me feel. While we are in different seasons of our life, I gained insight from each chapter. Some chapters had me reflecting on my life and other chapters had me visualizing what my life could be. This great book helped remind me to slow down and really get to know myself. From now on I will be asking myself and those in my life How are you, Really? I am so glad it was my season to read this and I was able to walk away feeling amazing!",
    "I found Jenna when I was studying digital marketing for my business several years ago, but I've absolutely fallen in love with the way she navigates business, and marriage, and Parenthood, and self care. She has stayed true to herself in every stage and it has been such an inspiration as I've paved my own way. I'm so happy she has written this book that teaches all those same things in a way that only Jenna can! I can't wait to share it with everyone in my life that may not be in the digital marketing world, but will deeply benefit from checking in with themselves and blazing their own unique path as well!",
    "I happily recommend Jenna Kutcher’s “How Are You Really.”\n\nThe first two sections are about doing a deep dive into your heart to figure out if you are living the life you want to live (or if you’re just filling your day with activities that bring you no real joy or fulfillment).\n\nThe real gem in the book is the last section. It’s the “now what?” part; a topic that no one else seems to want to discuss. This section tackled my “now that I’ve made a decision” and “now that I’m actually in my dream job” questions.\n\nI hope you enjoy “How Are You Really” as much as I did!",
    "I haven't read a book that I could relate to as much as this - Jenna hit the nail on the head in describing some of the thoughts and processes we face as 30 something humans trying to figure things out and take the leap forward that we know that we are capable of. I wish every young woman was gifted this book - it could just be the key they need to unlock their true potential. Read it with tissues I balled - frequently - as it hit HARD on many occasions - relatable, real and beyond helpful in terms of how to reframe things - thank you Jenna for your vulnerability!",
    "One word. A-MA-ZING! Jenna captures the essence of what life should feel like to YOU and no other, in this 3-part journey to finding puropse. If you are looking for answers, if you’ve been stuck or feel like your life is on auto-pilot: this is the book for you!!",
    "I pre-ordered this book in January! So glad it’s finally here. I’ve been reading the digital version and it’s great. Really solid book to sit down with and do some introspection, includes prompts and other resources. If you like Jenna or are fond of incredible female entrepreneurs and want to know more about your potential? Order this book 😊",
    "This book is a beautiful thought provoking read. An invitation to check-in with ourselves. And it is gorgeous! If you’re into personal growth and development very highly recommend!",
    "Real and authentic. This book really helps you dive deep into your own life and determine where you can make improvements."

    "The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition by Don Norman\n\n“The Design of Everyday Things” is a very good sequel to the first edition of this book, “The Psychology of Everyday Things” published in 1988. In this informative and enjoyable edition, educator and cognitive engineer, Don Norman provides readers with an interesting look at what constitutes good design. An advocate for user-centered design this is a helpful introduction to the world of design. This enlightening 370-page book includes the following seven chapters: 1. The Psychopathology of Everyday Things, 2. The Psychology of Everyday Actions, 3. Knowledge in the Head and in the World, 4. Knowing What to Do: Constraints Discoverability, and Feedback, 5. Human Error? No, Bad Design, 6. Design Thinking, and 7. Design in the World of Business.\n\nPositives:\n1. An accessible and well-researched book. Excellent resource for professionals in the field but intended for all to enjoy.\n2. The interesting topic of design in everyday products.\n3. Don Norman’s credentials are outstanding and his mastery of the topic is manifested from his astute observations based on experiences in engineering, cognitive science and business. “My experiences in industry have taught me about the complexities of the real world, how cost and schedules are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of multidisciplinary teams.”\n4. A very good format. The book starts with a clear preface on where the book is going to take you.\n5. Good use of tables and charts to complement the narrative.\n6. Throughout the book there is an emphasis on what constitutes good design. It all starts with asking the right questions and Norman does a wonderful job of that. “Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?”\n7. Explains the differences between the three main designs discussed in this book: industrial design, interaction design, and experience design.\n8. Norman is an advocate for human-centered designs. “The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.”\n9. The six fundamental principles of interaction: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and the conceptual model of the system. These principles are discussed with many examples to help the reader understand these important concepts. “Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual models.”\n10. Helpful insights on how people use products; and the seven stages of action. “When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened.”\n11. One of the strengths of this book is the very important but often times ignored aspect of psychology in design. “The approach I use here comes from my book Emotional Design. There, I suggested that a useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion is to consider three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and reflective.” “All three levels of processing work together. All play essential roles in determining a person’s like or dislike of a product or service.”\n12. A key premise of this book, “…in my experience, human error usually is a result of poor design: it should be called system error.” “The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned.”\n13. A chapter dedicated to how knowledge of the world combines with the knowledge in the head. “The design implications are clear: provide meaningful structures. Perhaps a better way is to make memory unnecessary: put the required information in the world. This is the power of the traditional graphical user interface with its old-fashioned menu structure.”\n14. An excellent chapter on how designers can provide the critical information that allows people to know what to do, even when experiencing an unfamiliar device or situation. The four kinds of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.\n15. Insights on how to deal with failures. “Interruptions are a common reason for error, not helped by designs and procedures that assume full, dedicated attention yet that do not make it easy to resume operations after an interruption. And finally, perhaps the worst culprit of all, is the attitude of people toward errors.”\n16. Type of errors, the difference between mistakes and errors. “Slips occur when the goal is correct, but the required actions are not done properly: the execution is flawed. Mistakes occur when the goal or plan is wrong.” “What is a designer to do? Provide as much guidance as possible to ensure that the current state of things is displayed in a coherent and easily interpreted format—ideally graphical.”\n17. A key tidbit on checklists. “It is always better to have two people do checklists together as a team: one to read the instruction, the other to execute it.”\n18. The key to success of resilient organizations, “A resilient organization treats safety as a core value, not a commodity that can be counted.”\n19. Many great examples of sound design thinking. The Human-Centered Design Process. “There is no substitute for direct observation of and interaction with the people who will be using the product.”\n20. A real-world practice that resonates, “In product development, schedule and cost provide very strong constraints, so it is up to the design team to meet these requirements while getting to an acceptable, high-quality design.”\n21. Notes, references, and so much more…\n\nNegatives:\n1. I would have liked to have seen more examples of product failure. Perhaps, legal matters interfere with authors’ ability to share such information.\n2. More illustrations would have been helpful.\n3. For those of us in the field, appendices that provide more detailed information would have added value.\n4. The kindle did not take advantage of its linking capability. In other words, the notes provided were not linked.\n\nIn summary, this was a very informative and enjoyable book to read. Norman succeeds in providing readers of all backgrounds with helpful insights on what constitutes good design in everyday products. A highly recommended read!\n\nFurther recommendations: “Emotional Design” by the same author, “Inspired: How to Make Products Customers Love” by Marty Cagan, “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” by Nir Eyal, “100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People” by Susan Weinschenk, “Lean Customer Development: Building Products Your Customers Will Buy” by Cindy Alvarez, “Principles of Product Development Flow” by Donald G. Reinertsen, and “Well-Deigned” by Jon Kolko",
    "Insightful and easy to follow. Provides a trove of information that will change the way you look at things, especially why some designs work while others fail. A book to keep in mind if you're interested in design.",
    "Even folks who don’t consider themselves designers will benefit from Norman’s way of looking at the world. Approaching life with intention is one of the best decisions you can make. Choosing to also pay attention to and making incremental (or huge!) improvements to the design of every aspect of your life - now you’ve upped the game.",
    "I gained some insight(s) on how we interact with products and tools as well as other important human things like socially driven systems.\n\nWell worth the read for anyone interested in making the world better through better design.",
    "I like the book itself but it was supposed to come new and the binding is slightly dirty and damaged which is just annoying.",
    "I loved this book because it gave me words to describe what I already understood. I highly recommend reading if you are a designer!",
    "Don Norman is a genius. This is an important, seminal piece of work, beautifully written, and fun to read.",
    "Such an interesting book. Don Norman brings tuns of information and knowledge that will help every designers out there. It’s a must.",
    "*Please bear in mind I'm reading this book on my computer so it's displayed in double page format.* It's a good book so far but I'm SURPRISED that the top reviews don't include the fact that the right page often doesn't finish the last sentence of the left page. Sometimes the right page will start a sentence, and the left page will try to continue it but the top half of the words are cut off and sometimes, it often repeats the last paragraph of the left page.\n\nAll I'm saying is... maybe buy the paperback version instead.",
    "This is a great book to get you thinking. The concepts covered explore how we look at the world and processes what we see and it's influence in design (or lack of!). Recommend to anyone who has an interest in human factors psychology",
    "I read the original version of this book in the 1980’s and was fascinated by its content and scope. Since then I have had an interest in design and interfacing. I finally thought it was time to re-read TDOET and thought I would buy the updated version. It didn’t disappoint.",
    "Get the MIT press version if you intend to keep the book. I have the kindle version and its much better (on an iPad). The paper and book quality is abysmal.\n\nThe book is very well known and you can search for the author's videos to give you an overview of what this book is about. Makes you think and definitely a good starting point if you want to learn more about design",
    "Not a review of the book, I'm sure it's great. Unfortunately the copy I received was supposed to be brand new but the cover was quite badly damaged, acceptable for a second hand book but not one that is listed as new."

    "I thought this book was great. Jon spoke clearly and directly to my overthinking mind, helping me to identify the negative thoughts I struggle with on a regular basis. He provides simple, yet effective tools and suggestions for replacing the negative soundtracks that we replay in our minds with positive ones. I'm looking forward to giving the student version of this book to my teenaged daughter!",
    "Overall I enjoyed this book and found it helpful. Occasionally some of the \"power of positive thinking\" moments got to be a little bit much. However, a lot of the overthinking tips were sound, and Acuff's voice is charming and approachable. I'm glad to have it on my bookshelf for later review.",
    "I needed the reset this book brought to me\nI cannot wait to change my overthinking.\nJon is hilarious too!",
    "This us an eye opener from page 1\nNow my wife and I are both reading it again\nI want to give it to everyone I know. Do you think the president would read it? Why ask the question send it he will read it. The country is about to turn around folks! Thank Jon and I for that. ( I call him Jon we are tight like that)\nRead the book than go back for review. It is that good 👍",
    "I am grateful to Corinne Crabtree for recommending this book through her No BS program. Our thoughts guide our actions, and we can change our thoughts. My broken soundtracks have been loud and persistent. Reading this book, I feel, energized and empowered to turn down those broken soundtracks and replace them with what I want to think. This book really cuts to the chase providing tools for the solution to overthinking. I love Jon's honesty about his own struggle with this and his humor. I also love that Jon lives in Nashville. I know that isn't really relevant for most people, but since this is my home too, it felt like a bonus... a little more connected.",
    "“Overthinking is when what you think gets in the way of what you want.”\n\nHmmm. I do that. I thought everyone did that.\n\nI was right.\n\nI thought it was just how my brain worked. There's nothing I can do to change.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nJon Acuff has done it again. His book, Do Over, helped me find a new job in the career I had been out of for 15 years, and to continue to grow in that new/old career.\n\nHis book, Finish, has been helping me, a chronic goal setter and starter, to reach the finish line in several of the goals I have had for years.\n\nHis new book, Soundtracks, is teaching me how to flip the negative thoughts that run behind everything I do into positive thoughts that encourage me to move forward.\n\nI have always thought positive affirmations were silly, goofy and, let's face it, just plain dumb because my brain refused to accept positive statements about myself that it “knew perfectly well” were not true.\n\nMy brain is a jerk.\n\nSo is everyone's brain.\n\nBut they don't have to be!\n\nJon Acuff uses humor, science, research projects, and personal stories of his own, as well as hundreds of others, to prove that our brain can be retrained to avoid the negative thoughts that slow us down or stop us by replacing them with, not cheesy affirmations that no one believes, but positive soundtracks that motivate us to become the people we want to be. He leads us, step by step, from being stuck in our goals, careers, and/or relationships to being able to move forward with courage, resilience and a fun, new positive attitude.\n\nAnd he makes me laugh. Hard. Out loud where I probably shouldn't.\n\nHis enthusiasm for helping others is contagious, his references to pop cultures are amazing, and sprinkling queso and gummy bears, he encourages us to create new personal soundtracks that launch us forward each day towards the future we want.\n\nWarning: This is not a 'just say it and it will become true' book. Batteries are not included. There is real work involved. But it's so fun!!\n\nFortunately, there's not 999,998 steps to changing your internal soundtracks - just three.\n\nSo even if you don't have a problem with overthinking (and according to research, about 0.5% or fewer of the world's population don't), run, do not walk, and pick up a copy of Jon Acuff's Soundtracks. (You could always use it to help the rest of us!)\n\nP.S. Get a hard copy if you must because you are a person (like me!) who loves to hold books in your hand and highlight as you go, but do yourself a favor and get the audio book too. Jon does the audio book himself, and his voice, inflection, humor and enthusiasm comes across with every word. (Also, he adds extra stuff in the audio book that isn't in the print copy!!)\n\nFull Disclosure: I jumped at the chance to get an advance copy when I pre-ordered this book with the condition that I write an honest review. No problem. I love the books I've read by Jon Acuff and plan on reading as many as he writes, laughing all the way to a better me.",
    "Reviewed by: Nathan Claycomb\n\nIf I drank a cup of coffee for every time I heard a friend say, \"You're overthinking it,\" I'd be extremely sleep deprived and shaking uncontrollably. So I could barely contain my excitement when Jon first announced a few years ago that he was \"researching overthinking\" for his new book. I wondered; \"How long will it take Jon to write the book? Will he come to Lancaster to promote it like he did with Do Over? Would he think it's weird to meet him a third time? Could I successfully engage in the trademarked side-hug without the awkward waist wraparound I did last time? Will there be a course? A speaking tour?\" Do you see why I needed this book in my life?\n\nSo when I had the opportunity to be part of the launch team and a few pre-launch courses, I eagerly signed up for everything. But this was not a typical launch because this is not your typical self-help book. No, it's far more than that. Along with a team of researchers and a plethora of feedback, Jon has essentially cracked the overthinking code. In fact, he's rewritten the code by showing us how to rewrite our Soundtracks!\n\nWhile I have loved Jon Acuff’s work since his early writings, Soundtracks may be the most widely-relatable work he’s ever penned. It doesn’t matter who you are, where are you are in life, or what you are overthinking, Jon easily connects with your mind and your heart on this one. He infuses his signature humor frequently, but it doesn’t distract from the message. In fact, it enhances the truths he provides. I found myself laughing right along with him as he described the uncanny twists and turns life can take and the soundtracks that we play along the journey. I couldn’t help but read excerpts aloud to my wife! Between Jon’s whit and his incredible insight into mindfulness, I just had to share his simple, yet life-changing approach to thinking...and thus, overthinking.\n\nA standout thought caught my attention early on in Soundtracks. Jon says, \"Fear does not take work. Doubt does not take work. Insecurity does not take work.” Have you ever stopped to think about that? Me neither! What does take work? Breaking free from fear, doubt and insecurity by playing new soundtracks that are louder than the old broken ones that keep us stuck. Jon shared three questions we must ask our current soundtracks. I didn’t know how much I needed these three questions in my arsenal. I won’t spoil the learning by sharing them, but I believe they have the power to free you from some badly broken soundtracks. In the past two weeks, I've used these three questions to help reshape the way our family communicates in the present, ruminates on the past, and dreams about the future!\n\nSo if you'd be drinking as much overthinking java as me, Soundtracks is for you. It's time for me to get back to work on writing my new anthem for life. I truly believe every person still reading this review will be challenged and inspired to do the same. Let's be like Jon. Let's change our super problem into a superpower, and take back our time, creativity and productivity in the process. You deserve (new) Soundtracks!",
    "Overthinkers need cut through, obvs. A guy I was seeing, but not anymore, but still see, who I asked about whether I'd manage to succeed in starting my own business, blasted me that I needed to stop overthinking everything. It was only a few days before I'd found this book to help. Which it has and now I'm going to start the 30 days exercise.. I get it, it's a habit to be broken. Jon set this out Crystal clear here, the kind of get on with it advice you need from someone who understands and has done it themselves. Easy read, if you overthink.. Just read it!",
    "A well written book, very helpful and easy to read! Thank you Jon",
    "Einzelne Gedanken wieder und wieder im Kopf zu haben, die berühmte kaputte Schallplatte, kann einen ganz schön zermürben.\n\nDieses over thinking ist gar nicht so leicht in den Griff zu kriegen.\n\nDer Autor Jon Acuff hat mit seinem Buch Soundtracks eine erstaunlich simple Lösung beschrieben mit der man diesen sich wiederholenden Gedankensalat tatsächlich gut in den Griff bekommen.\n\nSeine Art zu schreiben ist zudem auch sehr witzig, so dass man immer wieder schmunzeln muss was bei der Schwere des Themas wirklich hilft.\n\nEr hat auch begleitend viele wissenschaftlich gestützte Studien machen lassen, was das Ganze sehr seriös und nachvollziehbar macht.\n\nEs ist ein ungemein praktisches Buch, aus dem ich sehr sehr viel für mich mitgenommen habe.\n\nJeder der sich schon mal ansatzweise mit dem Thema Affirmationen beschäftigt hat, findet hier zudem eine großartige, wissenschaftlich gestützte Grundlage, wie sich damit tatsächlich arbeiten lässt. Auf eine Art und Weise die uns im Leben vorwärts bringt.\n\nUnterstützend zu denken, lässt sich lernen und tut ungemein gut.",
    "No one really teaches you how to think as you grow up. We cram our minds full of knowledge, but we pay no attention to the constant Soundtracks playing in the background. Soundtracks that tell us, \"Life is hard,\" \"Work is a grind,\" and, \"You're not ________ enough.\" Without sounding like some hokey infomercial motivator, Acuff not only exposed my faulty soundtracks, he helped me rewrite them.\nI'm grateful for this book and will be thinking about thinking in a new way for many years to come.",
    "I have battled with obsessive, intrusive thoughts all my life. As I read Soundtracks, there were so many moments when I felt like Jon was right inside my head, telling the story of my own struggles. But not only did he see right through me, he also offered simple, practical tools to help me overcome overthinking. I have already “retired” a few old soundtracks and replaced them with new ones... and it has completely revolutionize my world!\n\nAs always, Jon’s writing is relatable, engaging, and laugh-out-loud-funny. If Soundtracks doesn’t have you re-thinking your overthinking, I don’t know what will!"

    "I'm five chapters through this, so far (out of 21), and am writing this because Amazon prompted me to.\n\nThe business and organizational portions of this seem strong. The authors warn their readers to consult attorneys in matters of law.\n\nThey should have followed their own advice. The legal portions are wrong. They conflate criminal and civil law, say that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are mandatory and set definitions for things in civil law that are governed by the states in finding liability, claim there are three burdens of proof for negligence, and imply that the EU's claims of universal jurisdiction in the GDPR might make it international law. None of that is right. Some of it doesn't even make sense.\n\nCriminal and civil law are completely different. The FSG only apply in criminal cases, post-judgment. They have nothing to do with civil liability or with state law. There are four *elements* to negligence, not three \"burdens of proof.\" And it takes way, WAY more to incorporate something into an accepted principle of international law than a collection of legislators declaring the whole universe is subject to their whims.\n\nThere's more, but I'm not going to go fetch my books to see what I wrote in the margins every time. Just know that the legal portions of this book are, at *best*, wrong. Sometimes, they're \"not even wrong\" (meaning the premises are SO f'd up they don't even make sense).\n\nUPDATE: I'm now >400 pages in and I'm deleting a star. The reason is that the number of definitional and technical mistakes (not just legal) are now accumulating. For instance, mis-using the terms 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-party (p. 415), \"eavesdropping\" (p. 410), and even \"screen saver\" (p. 410); incorrectly implying that Arduinos are limited to 8-bit operations (p. 387); saying \"see the section \"Edge and Fog Computing,\" earlier in this chapter\" when the section not only had not yet appeared, it was the *next* section (p. 385); saying that \"SCADA is often referred to as a human-machine interface (HMI) since it enables people to better...\" which is not correct--an HMI is a point in an ICS system where a person can control the otherwise automated control systems, as per NIST and Idaho National Labs ICS course, whereas SCADA is the entire geographically spread-out system (p. 379); and incorrectly stating that a Faraday cage can be designed to allow longer radio waves but deny shorter ones (p. 368). [Note that all these listed errors are in ONE chapter (Chapter 9).] On p. 254, the authors got mathematical variables confused.\n\nAnother legal point, because it's really bad. On p. 198, they say that a company can delete evidence after they know an incident has happened, but before a lawsuit is filed. That's almost universally wrong, and doing so can result in (depending on jurisdiction and spoliation rules) criminal sanctions or the \"civil death penalty\" of automatically losing any resulting lawsuit on the grounds that you destroyed evidence favorable to the other party.\n\n\"The unanimous view of the federal courts is that federal law imposes upon a party a duty to preserve relevant evidence from the time that the party can reasonably anticipate litigation.\" That is the opening sentence of FEDERAL COMMON LAW AND THE COURTS’ REGULATION OF PRE-LITIGATION PRESERVATION, a law article by a judicial clerk named John Koppel.\n\nDoing what the authors tell you to do here will screw you and your organization.\n\nI'm also irritated by the authors' PC censorship streak, where they rename existing, well-understood technical terms because their pansy sensibilities are offended. This is supposed to be a technical study manual. Keep your propaganda to yourself.\n\nExamples? They've decided that the generations-old and universally understood terms \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\" aren't allowed anymore. Likewise with the term Chinese Wall (p. 335). I wonder what kind of fit they throw about the 'Great Firewall of China,' a term used by the same millions of Chinese who are subject to its censorship and social controls, or about master and slave systems, or male and female connectors? Do gender-benders (adapters that reverse connection types from male to female or vice versa) make them faint? Man-in-the-Middle attacks are renamed, because the term is \"gendered.\"\n\nOn the up side, the cryptography sections seem correct.\n\nUPDATE 2: I'm now through chapter 20 of 21. It is obvious this book was the product of multiple authors writing multiple sections separately and then having them shoved together. Portions are uselessly redundant (like the Service-Level Agreements [SLA] section in Chapter 20 and the SLA section in Chapter 16). Some parts disagree with other parts. Some chapters are organized well to apply to the exam callouts they are supposed to cover; others are *not*. On p. 842, a paragraph in one section is obviously supposed to be part of the preceding section; someone screwed up their cut/paste.\n\nThey routinely f-up the concept of \"third party.\" Guys, you cannot have a \"third party\" unless you already have a \"second party.\" If I sign a contract with with a company and no one else is involved, they are not a \"third party.\" Seriously, this is not complicated. But it's wrong virtually everywhere throughout this book.\n\nThere are still serious technical mistakes. On p. 566, they try to sell the idea that digital signals are more reliable than analog signals over long distances but don't know the difference between attenuation and interference, seem to think \"direct current voltage\" is a thing, imply that direct current signals are immune to attenuation (lol), and don't seem to understand that the '1s and 0s' they always hear about are actually 'voltage highs and voltage lows' and if their digital signal fails to cross the requisite threshold cleanly the signal becomes corrupted.\n\nOh, this one drives me f'ing crazy. One of these authors (see Chapter 11) is absolutely, utterly convinced that TCP/IP is a single protocol; a special 'multi-layer protocol.' No. Just no. TCP is a layer 4 transport protocol, like UDP is. IP is a layer 3 network protocol. 'TCP/IP' was the term the DOD applied to their network model in the 1980s, that is slowly supplanting the OSI model because the OSI one is needlessly complicated. This is so ridiculously stupid I can't believe the three technical editors let it fly. But there're a lot of editing problems in this book, so...\n\nOn p. 503, there is a sidebar about routing protocols that says \"interior routing protocols... make next hop decisions based solely on information related to that next immediate hop.\" This is wrong. Even RIP (the oldest, most primitive routing protocol in use) makes routing decisions based off the whole topology; that's the entire point, it operates by number of hops between source and destination without regard to things like throughput, reliability, and congestion.\n\nOne of the practice questions on p. 493 asks \"what type of motion detector senses changes in the electrical or magnetic field surrounding a monitored object.\" Answer: capacitance. Uh, no. Magnetic flux is a function of inductors, not capacitors. Some touch screens are capacitance based, because the physical changes cause capacitive changes. They don't work by waving your hands around. There are a lot of electrical mistakes in this book... see their butchered explanation of noise on p. 467, where they misused the term 'transverse mode' as 'traverse mode,' misused the term power (there's no electrical power without a load, guys), and gave the almost-definition of voltage (the difference in electrical potential between the ground and 'hot' wire) as the definition for noise.\n\nThey conflate rooting and jailbreaking on p.417, and then try to discuss the legality of it. They fail.\n\nSome parts are just dumb, like saying it's \"hardly fair\" to hold software engineering to the same standards as other engineering disciplines \"that are centuries old,\" like civil engineering (without any mention of nuclear, aerospace, or electrical engineering, which are vastly younger), or addressing the merits of the matter at all. This is just whining that most engineers think 'software engineering' is an appropriation of their discipline name to try to lend a veneer of credibility to something that is manifestly not engineering (think 'custodial engineer' instead of 'janitor' and you have the idea).\n\nThey like to make reference to government and military practices, but don't know that SCIF is pronounced \"skiff,\" instead of \"ess see eye eff,\" so they write \"an SCIF\" over and over.\n\nThey insist that gait analysis is a reliable biological way of identifying people, even though emulating gaits has been used in disguise for centuries and every half-decent actor can pull it off.\n\nCrappy legal descriptions continue. They make fun of the idea of getting legal information from television shows, but then do the same thing: on p. 921, \"If investigators fail to comply with even the smallest detail of these provisions, they may find their warrant invalidated and the results of the search deemed inadmissible.\" Uh, no. See Doctrine of Inevitable Discovery. Also, minor errors in warrant executions are routinely held inconsequential in court challenges. They try to describe hearsay rules and blow it. This not surprising; law students screw this up all the time. But the statement that \"a witness... cannot testify about what someone else told them outside of court...\" is fundamentally wrong. \"He said he would kill her\" is not hearsay. Saying he killed her because you heard someone else say he would is hearsay.\n\nThey rename physical evidence as \"real evidence,\" for no reason. They also say there is such a thing as \"conclusive evidence... that is incontrovertible\" and give DNA as an example... even though it controvertible in the case of multiple birth siblings, flawed evidence collection, planted evidence, and so on. They confuse evidentiary standards and burdens of proof. They try really hard to explain how MOUs and MOAs are different from binding contracts and fail, because they don't actually understand contracts. They do, however, use the term parol evidence rule correctly.\n\nOn p. 829, they warn that you cannot entrap people with honeypots, because it's illegal. This is completely wrong. Entrapment applies specifically to law enforcement, and prevents them from enticing people to commit crimes they wouldn't have otherwise committed. It has nothing to do with civil behavior in any jurisdiction I've ever heard of.\n\nAnother element of PC stupidity: Mantraps are now \"access control vestibules.\" Because gendered. FFS.\n\nWHY LISTEN TO ME? I'm a lawyer, electrical engineer, and certified network engineer who has about 9 years experience working for a military with meaningful (but not extensive) security training (CEH, Sec+, some other stuff).\n\nFINAL JUDGMENT: I can't recommend other specific books because this is the only one I've read for CISSP. But if there is another comprehensive book out there that purports to cover the test, go read it. This one misleads you. It doesn't mislead you on everything (the cryptography, technical security, and certain other sections seem to be correct, and the business/organization sections comport with what I already knew [though I'm not a business guy]), but someone who doesn't know better will 'learn' a lot of stupid BS about the law, electrical devices and behavior, and think that capacitors measure magnetic fields and no internal routing protocols make topology-based routing decisions, and might also think that stupid made-up politically correct horse-crap terminology is, in fact, normal and established.\n\nThey play loose and easy with law, electromagnetism and other technical details, but are *totally on top of* their post-modern Newspeak. They never missed an opportunity to remind you that \"Man-in-the-Middle\" is totally uncool, guys. That indicates the priorities of this book.\n\nThe About the Authors section says they have 'written or contributed' to (collectively) >140 books. They hold all these certifications and have all these awards. I've worked as a legal editor, technical editor, and been published in my own right. They should be embarrassed by this product. I would be.\n\nDeleted another star. I can't justify three for an annoying, untrustworthy book I don't recommend.\n\nUPDATE 3: Moved onto the practice tests. Other reviewers' comments about bad questions are on target. Not all of them or even most, but some are just... wrong. Example: Chapter 3, #30, the answers don't match the question. Also Chapter 3, # 44, it asks about a topic that is apparently not covered by this edition of the study guide but, according to my investigation, WAS covered in a previous edition, indicating that these questions are (at least partly) a copy-paste job.\n\nAnd be aware that, according to others who have taken the exam after using these products, these 'Practice Tests' are not actually 'Practice Tests.' They are study aids. The questions and explanations (when they're right...) are for studying, not as an honest measurement of your likely performance on the real exam, which is significantly harder.",
    "I just started this book and in the practice test alone there are errors, I highly suggest reading the entire explanation of the \"answers\" because the lettered answers may be incorrect. Like with all study guides there will be many of them, sometimes the best ones will be obvious, most of the times not.\n\nThey key to taking these tests and passing them is diversification of material, especially practice tests. Normally these books don't give the true grit type of questions which is why you should find yourself using a different source for practice tests. However, this is a good start and for a very good price, just make sure you keep an open mind once you start smashing and dashing question banks.\n\nI will update once I get further along.",
    "Hello,\n\nI have over 30+ years working in information technology and services, I also multi certified and hold seven other vendor neutral certifications, some in infosec as well. Out of those 30 years, I have taught CompTIA certification training both nationwide and worldwide remote and live. I know two, out of the three authors of this main 9th edition book (they would not remember me, and I'm quite certain of that). This is my fair and unbiased review of this book.\n\nI unfortunately, bought the 8th edition bundle at the middle of the last year, per ISC2 recommendation. And also I did not know that the exam changed this past \"May 2021\", so I verified with ISC2 that this \"current\" exam will stay the same in three years time.\n\nI bought this book bundle out of convenience alone, the content looks the same to me as the 8th edition., The only difference is, that the authors have broken down domains and those \"re-named topics\" under each domain to their book chapters. This matches what ISC2 has on there site for those changes starting this past May for the new CISSP exam. Reference: https://www.isc2.org/Landing/new-cissp\n\nI could have taken A LOT of time and gone through and noted the changes of those topics per domains and newly changed / written topics, but decided it would save A LOT of time and frustration to just buy this new copy of the book, also again recommended directly to me by ISC2 because of the changes. I also understand that the certification book publishing business is a 100% money making business, and releasing a updated list of those domains and topics on the wiley-sybex \"Wiley Efficient Learning\" page, for those candidates that are listed as \"registered owners of the older book 8th edition\" book, probally would impact sales of this new 9th edition... But it wouldn't it be a great idea to offer that in the future? Just saying...\n\nThe thing that the large 9th edition book has, is bonus content accessible online after you register the book online where there is downloadable .MP3 file of the exam essentials that one of the authors reads what you need to know in each chapter. The audio is recorded on a Apple Mac computer using a muti-track audio editor software called Amadeus Pro. The files are recorded at a high quality bit rate (192 kbps) but the author / speaker did not use a \"pop filter\" on his microphone so as a tip, make sure you bring the bass down a bit on whatever media player device you listen to the audio recordings as the \"p\" in the speaking audio, pops a lot.\n\nThe companion official practice test 3rd edition book that is in this bundle, is worth it and I believe the online \"test bank\" is also different. You get access to that test bank after registering online.\n\nAlso, to be 100% clear.. The content in the main book is great, and the bundle with the companion book that is a part of this bundle, the official practice test 3rd edition makes up for what the main book lacks regarding practicing for the exam itself. One tip that should of been noted, is the syntax of the questions in the book are going to be far more easier to understand than the actual test itself (like every exam out there). So DO NOT get into the mindset, that your going to get easy to understand questions like what you see on the practice tests.... Don't get in that mindset! Again, expect the syntax of the questions to be way more complex.\n\nIn closing, I think if you do not have the 8th edition of this book, you'll find this bundle is very helpful and worth the purchase. If you did like I did, and bought the 8th edition book you'll find that buying this bundle, is less of value over all and more of a convenience than anything else. Good Luck to all that sit for this exam. - Mr.Tom",
    "These books (ICS squared official CISSP study guide) have helped me recently to successfully pass the CISSP exam. The book and the accompanying questions guide give you the breadth of knowledge you need to dive deep into each domain. The book itself is a great reference guide for any IT professional or cybersecurity professional. The book also provides you with other references where you can go even deeper on certain topics. The questions guide book has tons of questions that will get you ready for the test. There are about 100 questions for each domain to test your knowledge about that specific domain so you can gauge how well you know the material. Additionally, you have four practice tests of 125 questions each covering all 8 domains similar to taking the exam. I highly recommend these books even if you are using other materials.",

    "two pages were bigger then whole book pages",
    "It is good to start with this book. But yes you can't claim for online preps tests, as this is not original but reprinted.

But end of the day content matters which Mike chapple truly justified. Go for it. All the best.",
    "I read two different books to prepare the CISSP exam. One of them is the Ninth edition of the Official Study Guide. It's big, full of valuable knowledge, and the questions related to each chapter are quite ok with the content, with few exceptions. As I'm not living in the USA, I can't tell about US Laws, I hope it's true for the exam.\nI found some missing things, and some errors in the Guide. For example, questions are talking about Fagan, but fagan isn't explained in the book. Also a question about the four most common VPN, but the books lists five, and L2F isn't ins the list, but in the question.\n\nFor the Official Practices Tests, it's totally different. There are a lot of mistakes. Too much... Some questions are about things that aren't explained at all in the Guide, some answers are false, and so on. For example, they explain SNAT doesn't exist (made up for the question), one question tells SDS is Software-defined-Security (onlsy SDS is given), but in reality SDS is Software-Defined Storage even if the other one exists but not as a acronym, one answer tells that the name \"threshold\" isn't commonly used, on another question you've to define that the use of the openSSL library by a dev isn't using a Third-Party library, but is using open-source library, and so on.\nEach time I found something like this, I'm sending a feedback (from the training website). I hope somebody will read.\n\nIf the exam is like this, then 100% sure I don't get it."

    "Great insight !",
    "I found this book full of wisdom. Reading it change my perspective of trading. I see now that became a good trader is conquer yourself.\n\nThe advice and physiology this book gives you can work in many if not all aspects of life.\n\nThere are some technical lingo, which might be uncomfortable for newbies or no traders, but is not that much.\n\nA great reading, and definitely a book I'll put in practice asap, and return to it for reference and study.",
    "Everything you need to know about trading psychology is in this book. If you don't \"get it\" after the first read, read it again and again until you do.",
    "Traders loose money because they do not ha e a proper mindset. .\nIs not easy to Get in the trader minds, but after reading this, you can look for the mistakes and avoid some of them.\nIs not a begginers book, you must ha e some knowledge and trading experience.",

    "Great, well packaged. Product came in great shape.............",
    "This is THE best book in trading psychology. I believe all the top traders and the consistently winning ones owns or has read a copy of this. This book has now reached the top slots in my collection of trading related books. If you need to know few other books which you could consider owning, they are Reminiscences of a stock trader, How I made $2 million in the stock market, Trading psychology 2.0, The disciplined trader, Market wizards.\n\nThe book is a hard bound one with excellent paper quality. I definitely received an original copy.",
    "I read this book completely with slow speed to grasp each and every chapter. I have had read other books also on trading psychology but this book appeared to me as the best among the same.\nThe author has in the beginning narrated typical journey of a trader and how most of the traders wipe out their entire capital within a year. The Book unfolds each and every characteristic of the nature of beliefs a typical trader holds which act as a hindrance in his trading journey. The comparison of trading with Casino operator is a perfect symmetry of the whole game. A novice trader first wins money, he becomes euphoric, then he looses money, he realizes need to learn various tools and a host of technical analysis. But, still he continues to loose money. The Author has analyzed why? There are hundreds of variables on which the markets react to. No trader, howsoever intelligent and knowledgeable can say for certain that a trade that he takes will win.\nThe Author has in subsequent chapters, given deep insight into molding the mental set of of a trader to be in tune with what market is offering. How an edge of a trader over others can work by just treating it as a higher probability and nothing else.\nThe magic of the solution lies in the last couple of chapters where the Author has asked the readers to pen down 5 Fundamental Truths about trading and 7 principles for creating consistency in winning.\nI have taken down some important notes from the book for my own use. I go through these notes at least once in a week to stay my mindset aligned with the what the market is offering.",
    "I have had this book in an audible version for ages but never got round to listening to it. Instead I have devoured every TA book I could lay my hands on trying to rectify all the trading issues I was having. I eventually ordered this book in hard format and it probably would have sat on my shelf unread but for the fact that this book arrived before the TA one that I ordered. I'M SO GLAD I FINALLY READ THIS BOOK! It has completely changed the way I view the markets, the way the markets move and my place within that movement.\n\nI'm so excited to finally get off the boom and bust roller coaster of fear, anxiety, hesitation, self-doubt, euphoria and recklessness and I know without a shadow of a doubt that this book contains the solution to the majority of my trading issues and will allow me to trade in an entirely different way! This book has changed my entire mindset and I feel like over the course of the 5 days it has taken me to read this book the blinkers have been shed and I now know with a cast iron certainty that I cannot EVER know or predict the outcome of any one trade and the best thing is IT DOESN'T MATTER! As long as my edge allows me to make money over a series of trades according to probability then my risk is just the price of me achieving this win rate.\n\nLiterally a life changing A-HA! moment in my life! I just wish someone had beat me over the head with this book 11 months ago!\n\nObviously I will have to work and continue working on these concepts and techniques as I have 11 months of bad habits already established that I have to suck the negative energy out of - but just knowing what I need to do to get where I want to be is invaluable to me. I'm not even kidding when I say I almost burst into tears when I started reading this book because I knew immediately I had found the solution to the trading problems that were causing me so much mental anguish.\n\nI'm just sad mark Douglas is no longer with us as I would have liked to thank him personally for writing this book. (Also check out his 4 part workshop on youtube it greatly complements and expands upon the concepts and techniques in this book)",
    "This is a watershed text on investing and trading psychology. Too often we underestimate the importance of individual mindset, psychology and particularly emotion on the effectiveness of our investing or trading systems. If we can our understand traits, strengths and weaknesses, then we can personalise a system which will improve returns. Douglas articulates the common dangers of trading, such as failing to take responsibility, and then gives us principles and tools to overcome them. Thinking in terms of probabilities and not ‘right and wrong’ is perhaps the most important single understanding. When we shift our thinking in this regard, and then devise objective rules in an effective trading or investing system, then we can be more objective and consistent. This book is a must anyone’s library.",
    "This book makes some useful points about the importance of a trader's attitude and state of mind and how this can have a bearing on success or failure. It was also a useful insight to talk about having an edge and winning over time, without becoming emotionally distressed by the losses along the way. Mark Douglas is no doubt right to say that the law of probability is key to this and, if you have a \"house edge\" similar to a casino with your trading method, then it will win through in the end. The problem with this book is that these insights are repeated endlessly with longwinded parables about, for instance, a child's fear of dogs used to make the points. Reading this book was a frustrating experience. There are no concrete examples of how to implement the author's strategies, nor does he even take the opportunity to talk from experience about his own successes and failures. Disappointing."

I have a pet peeve about damaged books even bent or folded magazines but anyway I thought maybe I could overlook the dents but it kept popping up in my mind hence the late review. I purchased it back in March but I paid $85/$86 on it so other than the dents, it’s a great book really substantial and beautiful pictures.",

The 2nd edition came out in all white and here is my review of the book.\nPro:\n*Shipping was extremely fast, I received it within 2 business days.\n*The White TF book came nicely wrapped up, no dirt or fingerprint on the book. It is extremely heavy so be prepared to use your muscle when picking it up.\n*The print of the pictures are definitely much better than the original Black TF book. It is good quality pictures (not pixelated like the original TF book).\n*It looks good as part of my home decor and it styles nicely for coffee table book.\n\nCon:\n*I wouldn't call this a Con, but I would never pay the original price $180, I got it on sale during Mother's Day. Definitley wait until the price goes down.\n\nThe White TF Coffee Table book is definitely an investment piece. If you are really into home decor and want to stylize your home, this is a great piece to have in your home."

    "This book has 3 distinct partitions taking us through how to develop our Mindset and Motivation for not just learning but about any habits. The final section when you are convinced that you can have the mindset and motivation to follow through the techniques, it takes you through a wealth of Methods and practical tips you can start implementing today!\nWhen I bought this book, it came with a free 10 days \"Kwik Start\" program along with free podcast episodes that I feel in itself is a deep dive into personal development I could immerse into.\nThe plus side:\n-It's very easy to read and the chapters are very well organised.\n- The free resources add another layer of depth to the learning experience\nit's a multi dimension book, making use of technology to take us deeper diving into some aspects by the way of the numerous free resources included in the book.\n-The book has Brain boosting methods for memorisation, focus, study and being in the glow. Information about nutrition and posture as well as discussion on how to develop the mindset and motivation to learn. Easy to read, well structured, full of useful tips with backing research evidence as well as reasons on how to apply them to adapt a limitless lifestyle.\n-it talks about self-identify which is key to any personal development\n-The kindle version I'm reading is very good. I can view all the graphics of the book all at once, I can even have an audible version of the book for free based on an offer I found towards the last pages if the book, provided I have paid for the readable version of book.\nPrior to this book, i had done one of Jim Kwik's super brain course, and was already looking at doing the speed reading course. Based on a few of the negative customer reviews I happened to stumble into on Amazon, I honestly did not expect that I'd learn something new in this book, but when I read it my heart lights up for so many things!\nMy favourite chapters were on \"Flow\" and \"Study\" in the methods section of the book. It has tremendous guidance on how to make effective notes, when and how frequently to review, and Jim convinces me with the logic and research backing of WHY I should be using these techniques to my benefit. I'm a person who likes to understand the reason behind the tools and strategies someone is telling me, so I was thoroughly satisfied.\nDuring the course of reading this book, I also did the \"Speed reading course\" which kept me committed for 1 month and now i have a very healthy daily reading habit. Now unlike what one podcast listener has written in her Amazon review where she found everything redundant, even after finishing the speed reading course i found reading this chapter extremely useful.\nI think it's very unfair of people to first squeeze into the essence of an author by regularly listening to their podcast and then go on to accuse that the book just has what the podcast has! My reply to these kind of reviews is:\n1. This book is about \"Learning\". If you paid attention to the podcast, you would gather that JimKwik is the product of his lifelong learning. Whatever he learnt, he tried to bring it to his audience for free. But everyone out there, does not have time to listen to hundreds of podcasts and then keep notes they can come back to. The book is literally a treat for us that we can keep going back to. It compliments all the other learning we have done and like Jim says, everytime you read a book, you keep learning something new depending on where you are at in your journey of personal growth and what looks most applicable. Unless you are a fact gathering robot, when you read a comprehensive book like this and reflect upon what you are learning, you are bound to learn something new every single time. For me, limitless has become a way of life and I'm thankful to Jim Kwik for writing this book and bringing to us the essence of his lifelong research and learnings, in such an organised easy to understand and apply manner.\n\nOn the downside the book, as well as Jim Kwik's courses do have a lot of Acronyms, which may get hard to digest sometimes when I'm speed reading. But using acronyms to remember things for longer is in itself a memorization technique! So I thoroughly loved the fact that this book is literally the product of what Jim Kwik teaches like \"practice of what he preaches\".\nOnly a fool would not find the hidden gems in this book, and I doubt that someone who regularly listens to Jim Kwik's podcasts would think its redundant. Learning isn't just about storing and comparing facts. It is much deeper, you listen, you apply, you read, you reflect, you make mistakes, you learn from the mistakes and apply the learnings to improve.\n- Also, never once in the boom did I find Jim, advocating to buy his course! Ofcourse, it's already a thick book with lots of concepts covered, how could anyone possibly imagination the author could deep dive into each of these areas, building on top of all the practical and useful Info he has already given! Only a foolish person would expect that a book could replace all the individual courses that deep dive into each of these areas! Even then I would say he has covered the techniques, the courses are more on if you really wanted to be coached and taken through the daily habits and implementations to be a 100% along with others who are doing these courses. If you don't do the courses, you can still start applying all the techniques today and start seeing the improvements. I'm teaching the study techniques to my children and nephew already!\nI think everyone who wants to improve their learning and study techniques should read this book and even re-read it using speed reading techniques.\nBuying this book is like buying the entry to a theme park, where you get most of the rides for free, but if you wanted to upgrade your experience and have even more fun, the park won't have limits and you could go watch or listen for free to the useful and relevant podcasts. Or if you wanted someone to hold your hand and gradually take you step by step gently while holding you accountable then you even have the choice to do the courses, you're never at a dead end!\nFor me, limitless has become a lifestyle and a mindset and the best part is, I'm even able to inspire my children through this, to never under estimate the unique unlimited abilities of their brains and never use negative self talk and instead see what potential their brains and thinking ability holds.\n\nMy kids are still young, but seeing they are already inspired by me being such a huge fan of Jim Kwik's limitless ways of learning, and I have taught them how to store memory facts in their heads for quick retrieval, we use the tips sometimes in vocabulary words, I taught my husband how he can memorise a presentation key heading while going with me on an imaginary walk in the neighbourhood area! I myself am able to go at a deeper level of learning and notes taking in the technical books I read which i couldn't process info from so easily before and am able to retain much more than before. I'm also able to skim through books faster, particularly in the areas where i don't need my mind to linger, Jim has discussed all those techniques in the book, but I suspect I was able to practically apply it better because I had gone through the speed reading course and had experienced practically and deeply by doing the things in a timed daily routine that buying the course enabled me to do. If I hadn't done the speed reading course, I'd need to be very self disciplined to take myself through these techniques daily to actually see the gradual improvements in my reading speed. Because like Jim says, it's the \"Doing\" that makes the facts turn into learning.\n\nI would advise, buy this book and you might even find yourself gifting copies to your loved ones :)",
    "I don’t normally write reviews, but Jim Kwik’s personality and growth inspire me. Limitless amplifies a personal epiphany I had a few years ago that allowed me to grow beyond a limit I adopted based on my childhood and based on a violent attack on me over 30 years ago. We all have experiences that hold back our potential as we grow and many limits are based on fear of failure. If learning to learn better wasn’t enough personal motivation, realizing that I didn’t have to be limited by my past was. I believe I am applying Jim’s method’s to an area beyond this book, but victims of violence or tragedy have powerful limits on themselves. Breaking those limits is the difference between being a victim and being a survivor. Thank you Jim for saying things so much better than I could.\n\nThe podcasts and videos do cover most of the book, but you can’t highlight and write notes on those forums and books let you digest rather than quickly hitting highlights of material and consider yourself cured and an overnight expert. The negative reviews are not by those really caring about the message of increasing your potential. This is an opinion of course but I the content is wonderful resource to revisit when the negative voice in our heads try to drag us backwards.",
    "I absolutely love this book. It is full of ways to unlock your brain's potential; brain research backs the ideas presented in this book. As a teacher, I see the benefits of students reading this book to learn more efficiently. In fact, I plan on using this book as one of our in-class readings.",
    "Bought it for a college graduate and it's benefited him on gaining a clear understanding what limitless means mentally and how to view one self. Highly recommended",
    "So odd for me but I have never written a review for a book, however I’ve read this one twice! On the second round I flagged many pages that ment a lot to me and want a quick reminder. This book clearly made me confident the I could do better. I’m just an ordinary person , 67 year old , and worried I was letting my brain just age, I didn’t like that feeling. This book has thought me to understand i can make it get working again. Now I feel more in control. All I can say is it works.",
    "I wish I can give more that a 5 review!",
    "This book is not for the ones who ace their exams easily. It is for those who invest more hours and end up reading and learning less. This book helps in people with a mind set that helps relax the process and make it more step by step. Avoid cramming and be better at being disciplined. Plan and conquer , while having faith in process",
    "If you want a good memory go for this book 📖 it's amazing",
    "Nothing new if you have read something else before on the matter. A big collection of references to other papers and authors plus some exercises that once again, you already know of them if this is not your first practical book, like the pomodoro technique for focusing. Other stories like the baby elephant chained to a pole that lost his will as he grew up and stopped fighting... I read it like three other times elsewhere.\n\nWhen you read the reviews, many are in this same line but still give it 4 to 5 stars rating, which could be misleading for the casual buyer.\n\nAlso, it's highly noticeable that Jim is trying too hard to adapt the book to the current times squeezing female characters everywhere and every time he has a chance. Nothing wrong with that as long as those names add some value, but I see it as a poor (pity) attempt to be politically correct. I would have loved if he elaborated on Oprah's, Halle Berry's, Marie Curie's, Amelia Earhart's, Coco Chanel's or Isabella of Castile's lives among others but nothing, he just mentioned names and stories to check the boxes.",
    "Jim has an amazing ability to help you unlock your abilities and inspire you to better use your brain. Whenever I watch any Jim Kwik video, I am always mesmerised with how he inspires everyone and provides really actionable tactics to help anyone improve their memory, reading, thinking, focus and learning activities. This is why I was super excited to get the book.\n\nThe book is a very easy read and helps the reader understand the limitless model which encompasses Mindset, Motivation and Methods. Jim starts with explaining why this is important especially today when we are affected by Digital Dementia and Digital Deduction where the dependency on technology is actually stopping us from using our brains effectively, have better recall and read and learn better.\n\nI think this is a very important part of the book as it sets the scene outlining what the issues are and then very clearly makes a statement that this can all be fixed. We can turn on the power and tap into the neuroplasticity of our brain. It obviously needs a system and training and this is what the remainder of the book lays out.\n\nPart 2 of the book covers the WHAT aspect, the MINDSET and discusses possibility. It covers some really useful concepts on belief systems and the 7 lies of learning.\n\nPart 3 covers the WHY, the MOTIVATION and focusses on purpose, energy, flow and small simple steps.\n\nPart 4 covers the HOW, the METHODS and discusses Focus, Study, Memory, Speed Reading and Thinking. This is comprehensive gives practical exercises\n\nWhat I love about the book:\n\n- It is packed with wisdom to help you to reflect and take action\n- It is packed with actionable tools, each chapter has sections called Kwik Start which prompt you to do something, write something or outline a technique. (I have included a photo showing an example of this)\n- It comes with a 10 Day video course called Kwik Start which can be used along with the book. It has great content and Jim inspires as he teaches this\n- It makes you BELIEVE that you can learn better and it helps you see this by giving you the tools and helping you develop the mindset\n- Every page is packed with useful information. This is not about Jim showing us how good he is. No waffle, no trying to repeat unnecessary things. The book delivers high-quality content on every page. There are dedicated pages for quotes but these add value to a book designed to be functional, a great reference guide and support to implement action.\n- It provides a framework to help train your brain. You won't improve just by reading the book, you will have to do the exercise and have a training regimen. Jim helps you to implement this.\n\nIf you want to tap into your limitless potential and discover your Superpowers. If you want to be a better learner to improve all areas of your life then this is a great book to read. I highly recommend this book for anyone of any age. Use it not only for yourself but everyone else in your life. It will be life-changing but only if you read and implement it.",
    "1 star is for the duplicity concern I have.\n\nDO GET IT IF YOU WANT, BUT CAREFULLY.\nHeard a lot about it. The only concern I have is; whether this book is an original publication printed in India by Replika Press or a brilliant copy of it? The quality is good but what prompted me to ask this is the mistake in the content and that too in the Introduction.\nI downloaded this book on kindle and it was fine. Sharing pics for reference. Pic 1 is the physical book and Pic 2 is kindle edition. Mistake is underlined in both?\nSo what’s the scenario here, Amazon.\nAre there any duplicates being sold at original prices??\nWhat is your quality department doing if that’s the case???",
    "The book was just an elaborated version of the same content that’s available on Jim Kwik’s YouTube channel and podcast. Nothing new or different. Methods suggested were good but it’s the same thing that’s already there online.",
    "I heard so much about Jim Kwik and was so excited to start reading this book. But if you read about personal development on a regular basis, there is not much to learn out of this book. No new methods about learning or speed reading except what you would commonly find on the internet. I was expecting so much and could only find very very few interesting and useful tips. This is very very disappointing. this was a waste of time. The book is nothing else but a sales pitch for online training."

    "Author John Doerr began his career under the tutelage of the great Andy Grove, CEO of Intel, who transformed that company into the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors. It was Andy Grove who turned a simple method “OKRs”, into a devastatingly effective business tool which became the lifeblood of Intel.\nIn 1978, Intel had developed the first high-performance, 16-bit microprocessor, the 8086. Soon it was getting overtaken by Motorola’s 68000 which was easier to program. Using OKRs, Intel launched “Operation Crush” to deal with this threat. The results were fast, focused and effective. “When we smacked Motorola between the eyes,” Doerr writes, “A manager there told me, ‘I couldn’t get a plane ticket from Chicago to Arizona approved in the time you took to launch your campaign.’”\nDoerr left Intel to join the venture capital firm at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and became an early investor in Google. There he managed to entrench Andy Grove’s business tool to great effect and it is acknowledged as a key contributor to Google’s success. The results have made Doerr the 105th richest man in the US. This book describes how to use this tool.\nJohn Doerr is the current evangelist for OKRs, OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. As a strategist, I know the importance of knowing where you are going or as Yogi Berra pithily said: \"If you don’t know where you’re going, you might not get there.” However, as Doerr writes, and as you and I know, “Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.”\nOKRs are for executing. An “objective” is simply what is to be achieved, no more and no less. Key results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. The difference between ‘key results’ and ‘key performance indicators’ are very different. I may really be impressed that you performed well, but your efforts are only useful if you achieved the results I need.\nMarissa Mayer would say of OKRs, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number.” With a number attached, OKRs are either met of not met. There is no grey area, no room for doubt. The time frame for an OKR can vary from a month to a quarter or more, but at the end of the period, they have either been met or they have not.\nWhen the objective is clear and specific, it produces far better results than when it is vaguely worded. ‘Performance excellence,’ or ‘Customer satisfaction’ are very different when expressed as ‘98% error free’, or ‘delivered within 12 hours’.\nAside from Google and Intel, OKR adherents include IT firms such as AOL, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Oracle, Slack, Spotify, and Twitter. But adherents also include firms such as Anheuser-Busch, BMW, Disney, Exxon, and Samsung.\nThe simplicity of the design of OKRs hides the complexity of implementing the method. When the OKR is formulated, it will undergo iteration – this is inevitable. And this is not the problem. The problem is the commitment of the most senior managers to the discipline that is required.\nWithout the most senior managers' commitment this will fail, much as your previous systems have failed to produce the promised result. In a meta-analysis of seventy studies, high commitment to managing the company by objectives showed a productivity increase of 56%. Where that commitment was low, productivity increases were a mere 6%.\nThe problem with getting results is compounded when we are employing people to think. On an assembly line, it’s easy enough to distinguish output from activity. It gets trickier when employees are paid to think.\nIn a thinking environment, many of the benefits of OKRs are highlighted. A particular challenge for many in such an environment is separating the person from the activity. All too often, feedback becomes very personal leading many managers to avoid confronting non-performance. When the focus is on unequivocal results that can be tracked, then non-performance can move to an analytical discussion. After all, a performance management system is a tool, not a weapon.\nThe OKR is formulated as “We will achieve a certain objective as measured by the following key results. This begins at the highest appropriate level of the organization and then all below can align their OKRs to this meta-OKR.\nWhen Bob Noyce and Andy Grove began the “Crush” project, the directive to Intel’s management level was simple and clear: “We’re going to win in 16-bit microprocessors. We’re committed to this.” This objective was given to the top one hundred people at the meeting. It was conveyed to the next level in 24 hours. Intel was close to a billion-dollar company at the time, and “it turned on a dime” - through a clear, aligned, objective and a clear required result.\nThe “Crush” project included top management, the entire sales force, four different marketing departments, and three geographic locations—all working together as one. It was proof of Andy Groves assertion that “Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.”\nGreat companies are not great because they have a great idea, but because their execution is great. There are no exceptions. Those who do not have excellent execution are an accident waiting to happen. Using OKRs, a successful organization can focus on the handful of initiatives that can make a real difference and defer the less urgent ones.\nThe very act of formulating the objective makes communication with clarity possible. Focusing on results rather than activities allows people to adjust their activities to meet the results, rather than to slavishly following performance indicators, as the environment changes.\nConsider this horrifying finding: In a survey of eleven thousand senior executives and managers, a majority couldn’t name their company’s top priorities!\n“There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little,” Andy Grove noted. To address this issue will require commitment to making the OKR process effective, and this commitment should not be understated, which is why it has to start from the very top.\nIf you are a leader of your business your commitment should start with a reading of John Doerr’s book, and then share it with your colleagues.\nMy personal experience with the process is best summed up by actress Mae West’s famous statement: I never said it would be easy, I only said it would be worth it.\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High ---+- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on strategy and implementation and is the author of the recently released ‘Executive Update.’",
    "This is a book on how to set goals and how to measure them.\n\nWith proven results in well-known and diverse companies like Intel (where the methodology was born), Google, MyFitnessPal, Intuit, The Gates Foundation, Bono’s ONE among others.\n\nSome ideas from the book:\n\nIt helps keep a company on time and on track and moving forward.\n\nIt is a methodology that focuses the company’s efforts on the important issues, so an Objective is what must be achieved, and Key Results compare and monitor how to reach the objective, so they are measurable and verifiable, aka OKR.\n\nGoals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction\n\nEmphasizing output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase activity can do just the opposite\n\nAn organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully adopt the system\n\nNothing moves us forward like a deadline\n\nThe author states that with the advent of social networks, transparency is the default setting for our daily lives, and that transparency seeds collaboration\n\nAnother concept stated by the author is that employees thrive when they can see how their work aligns to the company’s overall goals\n\nThere is another concept that goes along with OKR, CFR (Conversations, Feedback & Recognition), in this way OKR and compensations are separated but they are friends\n\nThe author states this powerful phrase “People watch what you do more than what you say”\n\nA must read, suitable for management as well as employees",
    "This is a great book for goal setting. It’s pretty dense. Felt like taking a college course. If you’re in the position to implement the strategies then the book will give value. This is kind of a classic “give you the idea, good luck on the execution though” Doerr tries to give as much help for execution but it doesn’t make it less difficult. Great knowledge though.",
    "This was a really fun book to read, and a quick one at that. Though the initial part of the book lays out exactly what you need to do, and the final chapters outline how to do it, it's the stories in the middle that tell you the impact of the what and how at exemplary institutions and organizations. A worthwhile read for anyone leading anything with a small or large team.",
    "John Doerr is a great OKRs populizer. He takes OKR fundamentals laid down by Andy Grove in his phenomenal \"High Output Management\", extends them and shows how this management framework is implemented across wide variety of local and global companies. The book is good. But why it falls 1 star short from a perfect rating is its nature of overselling.\n\nQuite a big part of book is \"customer review\" of the executives who implemented OKRs. The book has a feeling of hidden sales approach, as if John promotes his services of OKR implementer to the reader. As a person who is already sold to this framework way before reaching this book, I found it unnecessary. Book could be perfect with less stories from founders and more in-depth examples, tips & tricks, and technicalities of this framework.\n\nP.S. If you want to read this book, I strongly recommend to read \"High Output Management\" first, and then come to \"Measure What Matters\". This would give you a better understanding of OKRs.",
    "So I already knew about OKRs before getting this book. Our organisation tried to implement them a few years ago and failed. I was hoping this book would shed some light on how to create, implement, and measure OKRs efficiently in a small business such as ours.\n\nSadly the book fails to go into any depth about how to make the most important phase, implementation, possible. There are also 2 concerns which really calls into question the practicalness and authenticity of the book.\n\n1. John recommends that we separate OKRs from employee compensation/bonuses. That's fine - I'm willing to give that a shot. But doesn't actually say what a practical alternative approach should actually be. He mentions that instead of combining performance reviews, goals, and bonuses into one group... they should be 3 separate groups (performance reviews = feedback sessions, goals = OKRs, bonuses = bonuses) which form part of your judgement on whether to give bonuses or not effectively taking the hard facts out of how compensation is given and making it based on opinion. Exactly why he says later in the book that annual performance reviews don't work! (because they're based on opinion).\n\n2. The more alarming issue is that towards the end of the book John very coyly mentions that BetterWorks' software is helping companies adopt the OKR methodology more effectively and that organisations should really think about what tech they can use to make sure OKR adoption succeeds in the business. John fails to disclose (at least during that chapter) that he in-fact is an investor in BetterWorks! The book basically feels like a 280 page whitepaper written to desperately try to help BetterWorks get more sales.\n\nIf you want to learn more about OKRs and how they work, there's a great 50 minute YouTube video by Google about how they use them. Save yourself the money and time and watch that instead.",
    "OKR (Objectives/key results) are quite obvious and easily explained in a short blog post.\nThe book basically just says prioritize, take care of goal conflicts, have some safe, some stretch and limit your goals.\n\nNone of the stories tell what problem OKRs actually solved, how the right OKRs where found and if OKRs made a difference at all. The book does neither give a framework nor an actionable approach to triage the right things to measure.\n\nIf the objective of this book is to help people utilizing OKRs in practice, the (key) result is a spectacular failure.",
    "This book seems much more like a vanity project or a who's who of whom John Doerr has worked for! Not surprising I suppose, as how could anyone write ~300 pages on such a simple method; 1. Set an Objective, 2. Create key result. I imagine there are much better books out there if you are interested in actual implementation of OKRs, this book is definitely NOT a how-to guide. However, if you ARE interested in which tech companies Doerr has worked for its an indispensable resource.",
    "The book starts promisingly. Although OKR concepts are quite well known under different guises and Intel hadn't had such a great reputation as a place to work even when Andy Grove was the CEO, there are some interesting ideas in the first few pages. Unfortunately the book goes downhill with increasingly sugary language. BTW, we learn in the book that Intel, the great champion of OKRs was beaten by a start-up that supposedly didn't use OKR methodology.",
    "Great the book shares examples and case studies of companies using it.\n\nThis book would great if it added a chapter on a step-by-step guide on how to implement the basic OKR system in a company.\n\nI got bored after reading the nth case study - I was bought into okrs after the first chapter and got frustrated then by not having an explanation of HOW to do it!"

    "Perspective is really important in how you navigate the world. This book has helped me change my perspective on creativity and the lessons I learned have already helped me in my creative endeavors. There’s nothing revolutionary in the book, it’s not groundbreaking, there’s no schemes to unlock your every dream. It’s just a really amazing way to help you take a step back from your monotonous daily life and help you find you way back to creativity.",
    "This book was absolutely amazing. Throughout my creative journey I have consistently struggled with feeling creative. I have often struggled with what this book calls “imposter syndrome”, feeling like all I do is get ideas from other people, rather than myself. But the reality is, that’s what everyone does. Nothing is truly original, and all creative work comes from what came before. This book teaches you how to use influence and inspiration to create something new, something that’s you. “If we’re free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can embrace influence instead of running away from it.”\n\nWe put far too much pressure on ourselves as creatives. The simple fact is that no one really knows what they’re doing. This book describes the phrase “fake it till you make it”, not in a way of pretending to be something you’re not, but pretending to make something until you actually make something. Figuring it out along the way. Don’t wait until you know who you are before you get started.\n\nThis book goes through so many practical and inspirational ways to observe and use the world around us to influence our creativity (family, places we visit, who we choose to spend time with, who our heroes are, what others in our creative field are doing, our life experiences, music, etc.). We are not “stealing” from one thing, but a lifetime of influence that shapes who we are and what we do. This book teaches us how to channel that, and practices that allow us to use it, such as copying what you love from other people and using it not as plagiarism, but as practice. For example, the Beetles started off as a cover band. They made covers from hundreds of artists, and eventually wrote their own songs. All of those other bands influenced their own unique sound, and there are so many more examples and practical applications like this in the book.\n\nOverall I recommend anyone and everyone to read this. Whether you’re creative or not, you will gain something from this book. And if you struggle with creativity confidence, this book will help take that burden off your shoulders.",
    "The book lives up to its reputation (and how can I fault an author who quoted David Bowie and Tom Waits in the same work)!\n\nInspiring in both its simultaneous depth and brevity. Connected a few creative and lifestyle dots for me. I will be picking through this, beachcomber-style, again and again.",
    "Un libro increíble para aquellos que pueden llegar a sentir estancados en cualquier aspecto de la vida.",
    "I don't know what I enjoyed more ~ the writing or the illustrations! Spoiler Alert: The Illustrations.\nRelatable, realisitic, encouraging, doable. Steal Like an Artist is so good it's criminal.\nThis book is for ANY artist ~ writer, painter, sculpter, doodler, ANY ONE!! Buy, don't steal, this book asap.",
    "Maybe you know exactly what you want to do in life. Or maybe you are lost like the rest of us in the land of the lost souls. It doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are in search of the same thing; inner purpose. Secrets of fulfillment are no longer secrets thanks to authors like Austin Kleon. I have read his book Steal like an Artist more than 5 times now and it never loses its meaning - the fact that nothing that’s created by man is purely original. Most of us can relate to the undying stress and worry of what’s wrong with those of us who cannot come up with a new idea or business , or create something out of nothing like the rest of the Picassos. Guess what? There is no such thing as a brand new idea. Only an idea that is generated from another.\n\nThe world is our canvas and fortunately not a blank one. You can create from what’s already created and at the same time acknowledging it - it’s a way to show respect and appreciation to those who came before us because FYI, your work will be stolen too at some point in time. It’s the cycle of creation. The complexities you find are worth learning and from any knowledge that you receive exists an opportunity. An opportunity to create your own. You may be asking, but how do I know that I’m capable of creating that which I have discovered? By starting! Just do. The path is never rosy. That’s only seen on the static representations shared on social media. What’s not shown is the sweat and tears involved. There will be silent and unconscious moments that create uncertainities. At times you’ll feel like a mediocre but it’s all in your mind.\n\nBut seriously, start! Move from point A to point B. It doesn’t matter how short or long the distance is. Just move. And to find satisfaction in the journey, create that which you would like to see, have, taste, smell, hear or feel. It’s hard for the world to disconnect from the financial attachments we have in every single thing that we do. Money and the mind are cousins now. And so you may convince me that you would rather create that which will make you money rather than something that you like or love. We become unconscious on the main reason we desired to create; inner purpose. Money is an external goal that will come and go but does not assure the joy of being. So find that which you love to create and stop pacing with the madness of the world.\n\nThe workspace is ready and we have our brushes on hand because we are the boss of our own space. But you have to remember an important factor before you start. As you begin, don’t forget to find time to do nothing. I know you’ll get carried away and convince yourself it’s now or never and the competition is high. But please, take time to stop and smell the roses, literally. I won’t talk about working hard or smart because it’s an illusion that’s created to compare ourselves. Simply take your time to express your art. And take time to do nothing. Better yet find boring things to do.\n\nMost of all, however much we want to acquire more and more in the journey, it’s important to know what to keep and what to discard. Make it simple. As Lao Tzu states, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”\n\nHappy reading friends.",
    "I really enjoyed this book and think it's a super inspiring read for any creative.",
    "A good quick read, learned a lot about myself.",
    "This book was recommended to me by a few fellow creatives in an amazing community I'm part of on social media.\n\nI needed this book, but didn't know about it until it was recommended.\nI'd reached out to the group about the fact that as an illustrator I felt a bit lost in the creative world, like I hadn't found my place, because I didn't have a 'style' by which people could recognise my work, and no particular style that I favoured illustrating over others, I just felt like I wasn't a real illustrator if I didn't produce consistent work that was clearly 'me', like everyone else seems to do. I would (and still do really) trawl through the art by others I admired, and be able to say oh that's by so and so, they're so good!\nNo one could do that with me, as my illustrations are so random, there's no cohesion. Should I stop putting my art out there until I know who I am as an artist?\n\nSo this book was one of two recommended to me to read (find your artistic voice by Lisa Congdon is the other).\n\nAnd I'm so glad I did buy this. It all made sense, it all seemed so relatable, in particular section 2 - Don't wait until you know who you are to get started.\n\nIf you're an artist just starting out, or one who already creates a lot of art (any kind of creation really) and are unsure you belong in the creative world yet because you're not good enough, or you're not original enough, or you don't know your style yet - get this book.",
    "I liked the idea of this book from the description and I wasn't disappointed. I laughed out loud at some points because I know they are so true and it is an absolute joy to see similar views expressed so beautifully. As a fifty something I can vouch for it all. Get a good notebook. In my work and art I get through a leuchturm every year and it is amazing how much the archive of ideas and experiences in my books feeds into my current work. I was a UK Civil servant for years while I paid the bills and fed the family and yeah it made me 'vomit' daily... but it did free me up to do fantastic work in the time I stole from the job and the other time I made my own. I love the concept of captive time and I use that in my commutes. For me that is 80 mins a day of book reading and thinking...bloody fantastic. Follow these tips and your creative life will blossom...I can guarantee it!",
    "I looked forward to reading this book for so long! And I finally did!\nThe book feels delightful to hold in our hands. And it is delightful to look at. And stare at. And open a random page and read a couple of lines.\nBUT\nIt is not a 'book'. It is a coffee-table book. The quality is good, but the quantity of content is that of a tiny coffee-table book. It is a very small book, you can read it in less than an hour even if you read very very slowly like I do. And most of the content is borrowed (or stolen) from other artists! The only interesting or creative part of the book are the doodles and sketches, which the author has drawn himself.\n\nWhy I was slightly disappointed with this book?\nBecause it was repeating of the content I have read over and over in other art and creativity books. Though it may be a good place to begin if you are new to the art and creativity arenas.\nIf you are a seasoned artist, having spent much time studying the 'creative' processes, you may consider giving this book a pass.\n\nAlso, this book is highly priced, given the imported version. I bought it for Rs.490, and have seen it at lower prices around Rs.400 (Just to give an idea of the price variations). The cover price is 12.95 USD.\n[I bought a paperback version, and the cover, print, layout and paper quality are beyond excellent. The binding is weak and seems to have already started coming off]",
    "I read this a few years ago, and I had forgotten about it until I came across a YouTuber who was recommending Show your Work by Kleon, which reminded me that I had Steal like an Artist on my Kindle. So I just re-read it, I don’t know how many years down the line, and I am so glad I have. At a tough time (Covid, Brexit, good friends facing huge challenges), this book helped remind me of what really counts: doing good work and being kind. Thank you Austin Kleon.",
    "This book, among other things, reminds us that being creative should be play and not some deadly serious legacy to leave behind. It's not about winning the Booker prize, and hoping to be seen as sophisticated, clever and serious: it's about the joy of possibility and creativity.\nEvery aspiring, yet insecure and fearful artist should read this book."

    "A couple of years ago I was sitting on my couch and started thinking about how I can leverage my credit to do other things. I work in the credit field and I would always hear people talk about leveraging credit.\n\nI slowly began to think about ways I could access 0% loans from from Credit cards without it showing up on my credit report. Then the idea of using debt weapons to leverage to get out of debt. As I thought more and more I began to research different credit and loan tools.. Which surprised me as I slowly discovered velocity Banking. I learned that I wasn't the only one who thought of leveraging what assets you currently have, this has been around for many years.. and the more I dove into it the more it led me to R Nelson Nash.\n\nI was curious as to what was Infinite Banking.. I watched a documentary on Youtube and I was hooked. I immediately bought the book and have been reading it ever since. I'm hooked to the point where I'm implementing Velocity Banking now and will be moving to Infinite Banking in the near future. Thanks to a Youtube phenom named Denzel Rodriguez I was able to learn the basic components of Velocity Banking and implement it in my life.\n\nReading this book and learning how to think outside the box will help free you from what you've been taught all your life about Banking. The Banking world wants us to be ignorant as much profit is made from ignorance.\n\nPhenomenal and a very necessary read for those who want to free themselves from being debt slaves. Using these principles you won't have to worry about what you can / cannot afford. You can become your own bank. Say goodbye to those stressful moments wondering if you will get approved. You will be able to approach any situation with confidence and not need the approval from a bank to do so.\n\nBuy this book, Read this book, it will change your life as it has done mine.",

    "I have several trusted family friends in the insurance world who have called whole life a miracle \"investment\".\nLet's look at the facts. I could put One million in investment vehicles now. Like a CD Paying 2%? There are still fees taxes and potential loss - catastrophic loss. In ten years I could have nothing, I could have a million, or I could have been lucky and have millions. But that all depends on the strength of your stock or bond picks. Instead at age 55 I put that same million in a whole life policy over ten years. Did huge commissions go to my broker? Yes. So what. In 5 years my cash value equals my premiums. I break even. If I die soon I also have a couple million in death benefits to my kids so I can spend the rest of my savings while I am alive and still leave them something. BUT - if I live the cash balance grows as does the death benefit. So say in twenty years my total cash vale plus death benefit might be 3 million. That's one million to three million with MInimal Risk. Plus there are more regs and safeguards in the insurance world than in banking. So I can live off the cash value and always have some estate to leave to my kids. why would I put my money in a cd or stock portfolio knowing there is a chance of huge losses? The risk is not stomachable for me. Read Nash's book and decide for yourself. I vetted everything he said with a half dozen trusted friends in insurance and the business world. As for this comment - it is sheer semantics whether you call this an investment or not. It is a place to park money that will grow more predictably and securely than in the market. There is risk but WAY lower than even money markets or savings accounts.",

The question is, as Nelson Nash puts it, \"Who is going to perform the banking function?\"\n\nThis is one of those books that you can read countless times and still understand something new. The Infinite Banking Concept changed my life and is a viable solution to get rid of the shackles of fractional reserve banking.\n\nRead it, Digest it and Apply it.",

    "This was an interesting approach to the author’s personal management philosophy, compounded from personal experiences and observation of other managers. It provides some positive points and guidance in how to better manager individuals (mostly focused for tech people or people with that kind of mentality and lifestyle such as software engineers)\nis not alway through or successful in addressing all the various challenges a manager will run into, specially the really unpleasant ones. There is a lot of generalizations and there is no acknowledgment that there are outliers that this philosophy will not be effective on",
    "Covers need in todays world to be candid with those you supervise.",
    "I've never been a manager. But if I ever become one, I will strive to be like Kim Scott. Being a good manager sounds tough. I had never considered all their duties until I read this book. The author makes a great case for \"care personally, challenge directly\". The anecdotes about her mistakes and victories in management are delightful!",
    "This was an odd one, in part because it wasn't a book I chose. Our team has a book club at work and the Radical Candor was the first book we covered, in part because our manager is looking for us to provide each other with more radical candor.\n\nSo first: this book is written for managers, and I am not a manager. (I don't foresee wanting to be a manager any time soon.) If you are a manager, it's probably a better fit.\n\nSecond, well, there's a lot of Silicon Valley privilege dripping from this book. At one point, Kim talks about how letting poor performers go can be a blessing for both the company and poor performer because the fired employee can go do something like starting that coffee shop they always wanted.\n\nMaybe on a West Coast IT severance package (assuming they move somewhere else) but most people on the East Coast and all points in between lose a job and immediately have to go find another job.\n\nKim also talks about how things like minority status or being female might make radical candor more complicated, but doesn't actually talk about what to do about them. Frankly, I don't think she knows.\n\nSo yes, problematic book from multiple angles.\n\nAt the same time, this book gave me some tips and tools that I need. For example, Kim puts a lot of emphasis on giving praise, which I don't do enough. One of the highlights of my year so far was an unexpected piece of praise from my manager for a wiki I'm putting together. I'm trying to pay that forward to the folks I work with, because we all should hear about the things we're doing right at least as often as we hear about the things we're doing wrong.\n\nThe other thing that Radical Candor provides is a framework for structuring large conversations. When you have a business question where you know gaining consensus is going to be an issue, you can separate the \"debate\" meeting from the \"decide\" meeting, for example, to ensure that everyone gets a chance to have their say and at the same time there isn't pressure to make a decision right now.\n\nI don't think that Kim Scott provided enough direct advice on how to structure a piece of criticism. I think that Crucial Conversations does a much better job in that sense. But I do think that this book gives better examples of why constantly providing just-in-time feedback can help a team move from a place where crucial conversations are necessary to a place where everyone is communicating clearly enough that high-stakes behavior discussions are fewer and far between.\n\nIn summary, this is not a book I'd say will have a permanent place on my bookshelf like Crucial Conversations does, but it's helpful and adds some tools to my toolbox that I didn't have before.",
    "This is a superb book on interpersonal relations and managing people. Even as an experienced manager who has also read a lot, it's one of the best books I've read. I also really appreciate the author's clear and conversational writing style and how candid she is herself. It's refreshing to hear someone who is highly successful discuss her own missteps. I highly recommend in particular anyone in a supervisory role and really to anyone.",
    "One of the better books on Managment with real examples of what to do. Just telling your stories is one thing but to have examples of how to adopt a process or carry yourself is very helpful. I'd recommend all managers to read this.",
    "This is the worst book I have read in 2020-2021. The author spends 80% of the time jamming the title 'Radical Candor' down our throats (A model that isn't half as revolutionary as it tries to make out), and the remaining 10% name dropping all the places she worked with and who she rubbed shoulders with. This would have been inspiring and nice but didn't come across as humble and empowering. The remaining 10% was useful and have included it in the headline. Disappointed as I was looking forward to it, but I would suggest avoiding. Shame.",
    "Paperback is printed in a font so small it's quite uncomfortable to read. I only managed to get through the first 10 pages (which Kim seems to spend airing her grievances about how other people have interpreted her book), so I gave up. I get the impression that this book would contain a lot of waffle for what is a very simple message.",
    "The core framework this book is built around is strong, and the book strengthens it throughout with practical advice and examples. A near perfect example of a business book that gets to its point and doesn't waste your time with padding.\n\nFeedback is such a simple thing, but so hard for individuals and teams to get right without conscious practice. Radical Candor is an accessible and compelling companion for anyone trying to improve this aspect of their work.\n\nI highlighted many passages and shared them with colleagues as I read this book - a sign that reading it was time well-spent.",
    "My mistake. I hoped there'd be some wisdom in this book also for non-Americans, but no such thing. Office rituals and habits in Europe differ greatly from the described American settings (that I used to be well-familiar with years ago), which does not make this book useful at all (for me) here in Germany.\nBeing too open and/or too candid in the office rather is a hindrance and not appreciated. Actually, being too open to your boss and/or coworkers opens the door for jealousy and backstabbing which is a threat to any career. (Of course, other people's experiences may vary.)",
    "A book written by someone who didn't do what has been written about in the book for their career. Which is be nice to people. And be nice so it makes your job easier. A terribly selfish reason to be nice to people."

    "I read On Writing Well by William Zinsser twice. I loved this book. sOn Writing Well embodies what excellent writing should be. At first I thought the book would be a dull \"how to write\" book, much like a cookbook, without a lot of creativity. Instead, On Writing Well has depth and soul. It challenges me to ask, what can I achieve for the glory of God if I implement these nuggets of wisdom?\nOn Writing Well gives me a high standard to emulate and debunks many myths perpetrated by people I consider more knowledgeable than myself. This book is a gift to anyone who takes writing seriously.\n\nI also believe there is a spiritual battle waged in Christian writing. The evil one does not want God's glory to be revealed in human creativity. If he can persuade Christian writers through mediocrity and deception that publishing articles or books is the ultimate goal without a passion for truth, beauty, and redemption, our writing will be compromised. We will sacrifice our best-God's creativity--for a cheap counterfeit. As Zinsser states so well, we need role models who exhibit good writing that we can copy to help us develop our own style.\n\nI also feel \"normal\" now knowing I am not \"crazy\" with my compulsion to rewrite things over and over as I fidget for the right construction. I take comfort in knowing at least Zinsser does the same thing.\nThere are too many good points On Writing Well to summarize in a few short paragraphs, so I want to break them down into the four parts of the book as Zinsser presented them.\n\nPart I Principles\nAll these principles would apply equally to fiction and nonfiction.\n\n1. Good writing must exhibit humanity and warmth. A writer's product is himself, not the subject that he is writing about.\n2. Write clearly and eliminate all clutter.\n3. Be yourself on paper as you are in person.\n4. Write the way that is most natural to you.\n5. Write to please yourself--I like to think I am writing to please God. To paraphrase from the Bible, whatever I do, do it as if I am doing it unto the Lord, and give Him the glory. That means the reader deserves the best I have to offer.\n6. Writing is art through imitation.\n7. Avoid journalese and cheap words--the world has enough of them already (I know because I caption them every day). Instead, surprise the reader with the rhythm and cadence of verbs and nouns that express vitality and beauty in unexpected ways.\n8. Respect the English language and write correctly--it will show you care about the reader and respect his intelligence.\n\nPart II Methods\nAll these principles would apply equally to fiction and nonfiction.\n\n2. Unity ensures orderliness in terms of presentation, pronoun, tense, and mood.\n3. Enthusiasm will keep the reader engaged.\n4. Leave the reader with one new thought or idea to consider after he finishes your story.\n5. Be flexible--let your writing take you where it wants to go. Trust your material.\n6. Make your lead so compelling that the reader can't put your book down.\n7. Always have more material to draw from than you think you will need.\n8. Look for the story in your writing--people love stories.\n9. Know when to end (I have read my share of great books that I never finished because I became bored in the waning chapters).\n10. Use active and precise verbs and adjectives. Avoid overuse of adverbs.\nMy translation is, if it sounds like writing, it's a poor substitute. My favorite books are those where I get lost in the story--I have been transported to another world or another time and forget I am reading until something or somebody disturbs me.\n11. Omit the \"little qualifiers.\"\nIn my book Children of Dreams, I did a word search for qualifiers I tend to overuse like \"very\" and removed them. I also did a search for exclamation points--most of those came out also. The change in overall appearance was stunning.\n12. Avoid contractions like \"I'd, he'd, and we'd.\" I don't write these words captioning because I don't like them (they don't exist in my captioning dictionary), so I am glad to know I don't ever need to write them.\n13. Don't overstate. I have been turned off by writers who overstated a fact. My translation is, don't insult the reader's intelligence.\n14. Don't compare your writing to others. Your only competition is with yourself.\n15. If something can't be fixed, take it out. In captioning parlance, when in doubt, take it out. Better not to caption it than to caption it wrong.\n16. Keep paragraphs short.\n17. Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite.\n\nPart III Forms (Noted for my own edification)\n\n1. Dramatic nonfiction should have no inferring or fabricating, but a condensing of time and events is acceptable to tell the story, raising the craft of writing nonfiction to art.\n2. Seize control of style and substance when writing about people and places; take unusual care with details.\n3. A memoir covers a short span of time and is not autobiographical. Use sound, smell, touch and rich remembrance to allow the reader to enjoy the journey alongside you.\n4. When writing science, write as an ordinary person, sequentially, and never forget the human element is what will make the story come alive.\n5. Strip from business writing all the extra \"lingo\" and write with what Zinsser calls the four articles of faith: Clarity, simplicity, brevity and humanity.\n6. Sports writing is rich in opportunity for nonfiction writers--a source of material for social change and social history. Strip away the sports jargon and write with active verbs and colorful adjectives. (This chapter spoke to me personally as it takes months of training to become a competent sports captioner. Because I hope to incorporate sports into my creative writing, I'm glad to know that good sports writing eliminates the junkie lingo that I caption every day).\n7. Criticism is a serious intellectual act undertaken by those trained in the area of inquiry. The first qualification should be to love the type of art being critiqued.\n8. Humor is the secret ingredient to nonfiction writing that adds zest and joy to truth and life.\n\nPart IV Attitudes\nThe following would apply to fiction except for 6 through 10. All would apply to nonfiction.\n\n1. Avoid cheap writing, clichés, and breeziness. Develop a style that the reader with recognize as \"your voice.\"\n2. Write with sincerity. Your best credential is yourself.\n3. Focus on process, not outcome. Zinsser calls it, \"The Tyranny of the Final Product.\"\n4. Quest and intention should guide us in our writing. Quest is the search for meaning and intention is what we wish to accomplish--the soul of our writing.\n5. Writing is about making decisions, and ultimately, where you wish to take the reader on your journey.\n6. Consider the resonance of the words you choose and its emotional impact on the reader.\n7. As a nonfiction writer, \"You must get on the plane.\" (I think about the adoption of my two daughters from Nepal and Vietnam. My book Children of Dreams is about their adoptions. If I never got on the plane, I wouldn't have them. Neither would the reader have my book.\n8. When writing memoir, choose one point of view to preserve unity; i.e., writing from the viewpoint of the child versus the adult looking back. They are different kinds of writing.\n9. Remember, when writing memoir, it's your story. Memoirs should have a redemptive quality--readers won't connect with whining.\n10. Organize your memoir through a series of reductions, focusing on the small stories tucked away in memory. The reader will connect because the stories will resonate with universal truth.\n11. Strive to write the best you can. Give all of yourself. The reader deserves the best you have to offer.",
    "This was my second order. The first one arrived with pages upside down and was returned for full refund. Placed the order again and arrived correct and in perfect new condition. I would have liked the paper stock to be of a quality will last the next five years without discoloring, but can't have everything I suppose.",
    "Do you know how to write? I asked myself this before buying the book. I didn’t know the answer. My writing experience through college was that the professors assumed that I knew how to write, assigned a paper, and then graded it with no feedback. I wrote a lot but didn’t learn a lot about writing. Since college, I had started writing again. I had picked up a few tips here and there from reading books and blogs. I felt like I knew what I was doing.\n\nThen my friend recommended me this book. It made me question what it means to write well. I knew what I thought writing well meant, but I didn’t know what successful authors thought it meant. That ignorance made me decide to buy the book.\n\nReading this book was a journey — it started out great, then dragged on and became unbearable, and then ended on a high note with the most useful information.\n\nThe beginning either taught me keys to writing well or reinforced ones that I already knew: write with confidence; speak from the first person; tell your story; use a unique perspective; and use peculiar phrases to keep the reader attentive.\n\nThen came the descent. Zinsser is a great writer, but not the best teacher. I wasn’t sure I took away all the key points. Each chapter covers a different subject, with a lot of points scattered throughout the paragraphs. I’m not sure I picked up on everything he writes about. It would have been easier if he ended each chapter with bullet points of the key takeaways, or ended it with questions that ask the reader if they understood the key points.\n\nThen Part 3 put me to sleep. Part 3 is about writing about different subjects. The problem again is how the material is presented. Each chapter is about a different subject. In each of them are many passages from other writers that he uses as examples to analyze. He often quotes a passage, spends a paragraph or two analyzing it, and then jumps straight to the next passage with no clear delineation. I found myself drifting off for a page or two and then realizing I didn’t know what I was reading. I had to go back and re-read often. If he had made clear breaks, like starting each passage on the next page, giving each passage a header, or some other visual break, it would have been much easier.\n\nNot only was Part 3 hard to follow, he didn’t always appear to be an expert on the subject he was talking about. I don’t consider myself a funny person, but I learned nothing about humor from reading his chapter on the subject. He states that he has taught classes on humor writing — suggesting he has expert insights — but he only provides common knowledge: don’t explain jokes, and don’t repeat them.\n\nBut suffering through Part 3 was worth it. Part 4 contains the most valuable information in the book. He breaks down one of his own articles piece by piece and offers his thought process on writing. I got a lot out of it. He gives a lot of useful tips: think what the reader wants to know next after each sentence; the last sentence of each paragraph should springboard to the next paragraph; know when to end an article; and have a strong ending.",
    "The importance of this book is not difficult to explain - this is an essential must have for all interested in books, not only for those who write, but for anyone who reads; at the end of it, youll be better in both. The book focuses on how to write well non-fiction, but virtually all its comments do apply also to fiction. And it goes further and helps to understand why good writing is good writing and why good literature is good literature.\nMy favourite part is that dedicated to the basics: what not to do when writing, and specifically how to avoid, as the author calls it, the \"clutter\", with many examples of that \"clutter\": how banks, insurance companies, large corporations and, most obviously and constantly, the politians use the language not to explain, but to conceal what they mean, or to look more important; and all by means of using longer (and generally useless, many times gramaically incorrect) expressions. Thus: the very silly \"at the present time\" instead of the plain yet far more correct \"now\". There are an array of examples like this one.\nAs I said in the title of this review: a must have for anyone who reads or write; for anyone.",
    "This book kicked my ass. In the spirit of Zinssman's book, I'll keep my review brief. The book teaches you that clutter is the #1 enemy of all writers, and that tightening your prose can make you a better writer in every area of your life.\n\nThis is non-optional reading for all writers and professional, aspirational people in general.",
    "As you would expect this is very well written and gives clear guidance on how to improve your writing. It is litterd with fantastic examples and anecdotes to brighten up what can be a dry subject. It lacks some of the charm of Eats, shoots and leaves. but makes up for it in depth.\n\nHaving studied Journalism a decade ago I wish I'd had this book then. It taught me everything I should have learnt but was never taught. It demonstrates the subtleties of using the English language. Which, it seems to me, that between school, college and uni they expect you to learn but never actually teach. It took me only a week to read this book and I am a more confident writer as a result. There are some chapters that are specific to particular types of writing such as sports, or memoir so you can skip these if not suitable for your needs. This book is written by a journalist and so it is geared around getting you to write snappier more engaging pieces that would suit the news or feature stories. I wouldn't recommend it for academic writing so much.\n\nMy only criticism is Zinsser's attempt to wipe out the semi-colon in favour of the dash. How will we wink then ;)",
    "Amazing read. Fresh and lively. so much to take on board, but you have to read with your full attention. The gems are hidden through the book. So, keep a watchful eyes to discover the hidden treasure.",
    "Such a wonderful and exquisite learning tool. Just a mere reading taught me a lot. I, without wasting a single second thought of gifting it to the most deserving. My happiness knew no bounds when I saw that person reading it analytically and grasping the message on the go.I strongly believe that this budding litterateur shall definitely rise up with a creative work jaded and jazzed up with jewels of words and garlands of phrases. I recommend it for all and sundry. If \"On Writing Well\" is read along with \"The Elements of Style\", the combination can help one assimilate and accumulate wealth of knowledge about the nuances of the literature world. Read and relish the jelly-jam churned out like fresh butter with honey drops falling on it."

    "Conversations make up a significant portion of many of our days. Minor or major clashes can lead to issues at work and home, and may ultimately contribute to significant problems in our marriages, jobs, and friendships. Wishing for positive outcomes or for other people to be more reasonable seldom works.\n\n“Difficult Conversations,” written by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen, offers constructive tips on how to navigate through those encounters. The authors tell us that “…human interactions are complex. Trouble arises from the intersection of styles, behaviors, assumptions, and interests, not because one person is all good and the other all bad.” In a potentially volatile conversation, it is normal to hear what we think is being said without fully understanding the other person, which can lead to defensiveness and blame. At other times, we believe so strongly that what we are saying makes sense that we fail to recognize that what the other person is saying makes sense, too.\n\nAuthors Stone/Patton/Heen offer up new paradigms in easily understood explanations. Countless examples of different conversations are offered, some demonstrating how many of us instinctively react followed by demonstrations of how we can turn the discussion around. While ideas like reflective listening are included, the authors target the problems that prevent us from achieving positive interaction, explaining how things like emotions can get in the way and how to deal with them. Reducing blame, managing what is referred to as The Three Conversations, and other helpful tips like reframing are fully explained in such a manner that it seems easy to add these tools to our repertoire and begin using them right away.\n\nThe authors, however, recognize that these conversations are not always easy, and they also address those stumbling blocks with multiple examples. In the end, Stone/Patton/Heen can’t prepare us for every possibility to come alone, but if we perform the preparations outlined in the book, we can’t help but continue to improve and become more adept at using the ideas they have shared. If you would like to improve any of your work or personal relationships, this is a fantastic book. Five stars.",

It really helped to diffuse a bad situation, and lead to a great improvement in their working relationship.\nI would strongly recommend this book to anyone, as it gives great advice and guidance that can be applied in both your personal and business life.",

    "10X Rule Book Review\n\nGrant Cardone writes a game changing book, this book is great for entrepreneurs and sales teams. The book talks about talking massive actions, aligning your goals with other goals. It is a highly motivational book and I would recommend anyone reading this to read it like a text book. Reading once through is not good enough. I see a possible book sequel with proper in-depth tools and tips.\n\nThe 10X Rule book talks about:\n\n1. The 10X Rule\n§ You must set targets that are 10 X what you think it will take to accomplish.\n§ Massive thoughts are followed by taking massive actions, operating at 10X levels.\n\nGrant Cardone says that people generally do not take enough action, let alone massive actions. People are generally setting targets that are too low and not exciting, spending time competing and not dominating. 10X rule says do 10 actions and set targets 10 times higher than you first imagine.\n\n2. Why the 10X Rule Is Vital\n§ Never reduce a target. Instead, increase actions.\n§ Any target attacked with the right actions in the right amounts with persistence is attainable.\n\nGrant talks about the more actions you take, the better chances of you getting \"lucky\".\n\n3. What is Success?\nSuccess is important. If you quit caring, then you quit winning; quit winning long enough, and you will just plain quit.\n\n4. Success is your duty.\nYou must constantly demand success as your duty, obligation, and responsibility.\n\n5. There is no shortage of success.\nYou must rid yourself of the concept of success can be restricted in any way. Operating under this notion will hurt your ability to create success for yourself. Being dependent on only a single thing or person for success will limit your chances of achievement.\n\n6. Assume control for everything\nSuccessful people accept very high levels of accountability for creating and having success for themselves and even for failing to do so. Successful people hate the blame game and know that it is better to make something happen good or bad than to have it happen to you. In other words be proactive and not reactive.\n\nAnyone who uses blame as the reason why something happened or did not happen will never accumulate real success in life and only further his or her status as a slave.\n\nTo get where you want in life, you must adopt the view that whatever is going on in your world (good, bad or nothing) is something caused by you.\n\n7. Four degrees of action\n§ Do nothing\n§ Retreat\n§ Take normal levels of action\n§ Take massive action.\n\nMassive action is actually the level of action that creates new problems. Until you create problems, you're not truly operating at the forth stage of action.\n\n8. Average is a failing formula\nThe addiction to average can kill the possibility of making your dreams a reality. Operating at average levels doesn't work in any area of life. Most businesses fail because they are unable to sell their ideas, products, and services at prices high enough to sustain the company and fund its activities. The company isn't able to collect revenue in quantities great enough because the people with whom the company has been built - employees, customers, and vendors - also take only average amounts of action.\n\n9. 10X Goals\nHere is what Grant describes as the method of setting 10X goals:\n§ Set 10X targets\n§ Align them with your other purposes\n§ Write them down everyday: when you wake up and before you go to sleep.\n\nWe have been warned against setting goals \"too high\". The reality of that if you start small, you are probably going to go small. Many people bail out of projects when they experience any kind of resistance; their goals are not big enough. Grant talks about the importance of aligning goals to other goals to fuel will power, energy and dreams. Grant talks about never set small, attainable realistic goals , instead set unrealistic goals.\n\n10. Competition is for sisses\nGrant talks about never make it your goal to compete. Instead, do everything you can to dominate your sector. This means doing things that your competitor refuses to do.\n\n11. Breaking out of the middle class\nGrant warns about the middle class being the most suppressed, restricted, and confused socioeconomic demographic in the world. Those who desire to be a part of this is compelled to think and act in a certain way where \"just enough\" is good enough and a reward. The idea that one would only have enough to be \"comfortable\" or \"adequately satisfied\" is a concept has been sold by politicians, media, educational system to inspire entire population \"to settle\" instead of striving for abundance.\n\n12. Obession isn't a disease. It's a gift.\nMost people make only enough effort for it to feel like work, whereas the most successful follow up every action with an obsession to see it through to a reward. It is vital to go for a bigger goal if you wish to see 10X results.\n\n13. Go \"All In\" And Overcommit\"\nGrant talks about overcommitting your energy, resources, creativity, and persistence. Know that you are \"all in\" on that particular activity, everytime you take action everyday you are in business.\n\n14. Expand, Never Contract\nContracting is a form of retreating, it violates the concept of the 10X rule. You have to take massive action.\n\n15. Burn the place down\nOnce you take the 10X actions, don't stop, keep the momentum going. Grant talks about the importance of staying committed.\n\n16. Fear is the great indicator\nFear means you are doing what's needed to move in the right direction. Without \"fear\", it means you are only doing what's comfortable for you now.\n\n17. The myth of time management\nGrant talks about jotting down your time-wasting activities. Most people work just enough to make it feel like work, whereas successful people work at a pace that gets satisfying results that work is a reward.\n\n18. Criticism is sign of success\nCriticism precedes admiration, goes hand in hand with success.\n\n19. Customer satisfaction is the wrong target\nCustomer satisfaction is the wrong target, increasing customers is the right target. You will first have to get the customer first and satisfy him/her later. That means, you have to increase sale.\n\n20. Omnipresence\nCoca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa, American Express are some companies that you see everywhere. It is vital to be omnipresent in your industry if you wish to stay ahead.\n\n21. Excuses\nExcuses are never the reason for why you did or didn't do something. They are just a revision of facts that you make up in order to help yourself feel better about what happened (or didn't).\n\n22. Successful or Unsuccessful?\nGrant talks about a list of things successful people do:\n§ Have a \"Can Do\" Attitude\n§ Believe that \"I Will Figure It Out\"\n§ Focus on Opportunity\n§ Love challenges\n§ Seek to solve problems\n§ Persist until successful\n§ Take risks\n§ Be unreasonable\n§ Be dangerous\n§ Create Wealth\n§ Readily take action\n§ Always say \"yes\"\n§ Habitually commit\n§ Go all the away\n§ Focus on \"Now\"\n§ Demonstrate courage\n§ Embrace change\n§ Determine and take the right approach\n§ Break traditional ideas\n§ Be goal oriented\n§ Be on a mission\n§ Have a high level of motivation\n§ Be interested in results\n§ Have big goals and dreams\n§ Create your own reality\n§ Commit first - figure out later\n§ Be highly ethical\n§ Be interested in the group\n§ Be dedicated to continuous learning\n§ Be uncomfortable\n§ \"Reach Up\" in Relationships\n§ Be disciplined, create successful habits\n\n23. Getting Started With 10X\nGrant talks about\n§ Not reduce your goals as you write them.\n§ Do not get lost in the details\n§ Ask yourself \"What can I do today to move me forward towards these goals?\"\n§ Take whatever actions you come up with, regardless of what they are or how you feel\n§ Do not prematurely value the outcome of your actions\n§ Go back each day to review the list",
    "Work 8 hours a day? Come on man, you gotta 10x that and work 80 hours a day. Family, friends, scientists, anyone tell you that's impossible just ignore the haters because they're average and trying to hold you back from success.\n\nThere are a lot of things to like in this book: don't be a victim, take responsibility for your own actions and future, work hard, be resilient, persist. Grant isn't afraid to tell you that success is going to take work and that it will be difficult, and those are the highlights of the book.\n\nThe TL:DR of this book is this: the answer to every question in your life is to take \"massive action.\" That's it. No matter the question, the answer is always massive action. And honestly, that works for Grant and his wife. They're on the same page with what their version of success looks like, and they will do anything it takes to get there.\n\nThe real challenge is when discussing tradeoffs/compromises or these other things that Grant doesn't really believe in. Working 18 hours a day doesn't mean you're sacrificing your family, health, or spiritual life to Grant. He's just 10x'ing those things as well. How you ask? Just do it man. Be in it to win it. Time management? Grant doesn't believe in time management. Just massive action. Seriously, those are his answers for how to have it all in every area of life. The closest he gets to providing a tangible solution for success with his family is spending 1 hour in the morning grocery shopping with his daughter.\n\nI'm not being a \"hater\", I like Grant Cardone. The world needs Grant Cardones. They create great disruption and drive things forward, but the world also needs people to piece together the mess that is left in Grant's wake. He's a chaos generator, constantly creating \"new problems.\" Again, not a bad thing -- but you need a lot of do-ers, \"middle-class\", or average joes to make the whole machine work as well.\n\nI would use the analogy of a baseball lineup. Grant Cardone is a home run hitter. He's swinging for the fences, baby. Every at bat, every situation, he's swinging for the fences. You hit a lot of home runs this way, and you strike out a lot this way too. You need the egotistical home run hitter on your team. But you also need the base hitter, the base stealer, the sacrifice bunter. The cameras go to Grant, the home-run hitter. He's celebrated for his success and garners the attention. But what if the base hitter doesn't want that? What if he wants to do well, get on base consistently, but doesn't aspire to have the cameras in his face? Isn't that also success?\n\nSame for economics and the game of life. If everyone was a Grant Cardone we'd just have a bunch of self-absorbed chaos creators wreaking havoc everywhere they went. Again, this is something we need but becomes a recipe for disaster if we prescribe this solution for everyone.\n\nOverall, it's a great book if you'e in a funk and feeling sorry for yourself. It's likely that his tough love will motivate you enough to take some action. As far as being what he actually promises -- the answer to success in all areas of life -- it's pretty meh. Massive action is great thing, but the world is far more complex than having one answer be the answer for everything.",
    "I had brought hardcover book the quality and binding is superb! The price is little on higher side but it’s worth every penny.\n\nThis book is one of a kind, it motivates you from inside out and probably only book you would need for self-motivation.\n\nIt slaps you right in your face straight way by showing you the lack of effort and initiative you have taken and hence you are not successful in your life or career.\n\nIf you have mediocre mentality then this book is not for you, it is for the person who is ready to take massive action in life until success.\n\nMr. Sales would be correct synonyms for Grant Cardone\n\nIf you find the review useful, consider clicking helpful!",
    "I can sum up this book in one sentence: \"Work 10 times harder, then you'll have 10 times more success.\"\nDon't waste your time reading the whole book, you won't learn any more than this.\nThis is probably one of the worst business books I've ever read. There is no advice, no wisdom from the author, just a load of patting himself on the back for working 10 times harder and being successful.\nAt one point, there's an anecdote where he advises someone asking him for help on a Sunday to stop taking weekends off and working harder. Enough said.",
    "The author raises an important and fundamental point ignored by almost every other management consultant: it's not as easy as they say. And he may be right in his evaluation that things are 10 times tougher than you think, and this requires a similar push to get where you want. But this could have been said in a blog, right though it is. What really needs explaining is the how: how do you work 10 times harder or longer (when we're all given the same 24 hours). There's also a why, especially when he seems to live without compromise: success is the everything, and that's ahead of family and even petting your dog. Why should you live 10 times harder when your wife leaves you and even the dog finds a new owner?",
    "I had seen this book promoted by many online entrepreneurs as being very motivational and I have to say that it is. The author takes very commanding stance in his opinions as to how to achieve one's goals and I did like his enthusiasm. However, around page 163, he attempts to use an example in one of his arguments and makes an anti-flu shot comment about many health professionals doubting the efficiency of flu shots. As a health professional myself with many decades of experience in acute health care, I was immediately shocked and angered, as this is simply not true of educated and trained health professionals working in healthcare today. I realize one can have a personal opinion but it was stated and misrepresented as fact by this author, who is fairly influential on his readership. It was, to me, a highly irresponsible statement and cast doubt for me, as to the reliability of the rest of his advice contained in this book.",
    "I found this book to be extremely beneficial to me and my business goals. At a time where things weren't going well for me, picking this book up has centered my mind once again.\n\nPeople often give up due to underestimating the effort needed in order to achieve their goal. For example, someone has the goal of achieving £2,000/month in revenue within a particular timeframe whilst also determining the effort needed. Grant explains that most of the time there comes problems and obstacles along the way which were not originally anticipated. These problems make a person fall short of their goal, and as a result the person becomes mentally fatigued and gives up. In this circumstance, most people would lowere their goal and come up with a so called 'realistic goal', WHICH IS A BIG MISTAKE! Grant explains that instead of doing this the person should 10X their goal and at the same time 10X their effort. Even if the person falls short of theie 10X goal it's fine. At least they'VE surpassed their original goal!"

    "I am back once again. As always, I gave due diligence to my reviews. To those of you who found my ratings of multiple PMP publications helpful, you will want to read on. See collective ratings under “Michael Henry” https://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam/dp/1492310549/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1CXATM61H9GX&dchild=1&keywords=sohel+akhter%2C+exam+prep+book%2C+6th+ed&qid=1606711795&sprefix=sohel%2Caps%2C230&sr=8-3\nThat said, all my Agile book reviews are Verified Purchases.\nNow let’s get down to business shall we. This time around I decided to rate multiple Agile Guides using the same criteria listed on my PMP Guide Evaluations. Obviously, it was necessary to revise/tailor the criteria to meet the unique requirements for Agile-based project management versus the Traditional Waterfall approach. In other words, my ratings were based on how well a given Agile publication satisfies requirements as defined by PMI, AgileAlliance.org and applicable industry standards. As for why I chose to evaluate Agile-based guides is simple. It is my understanding that PMI will be instituting new guidelines regarding their PMP certification requirements. Part of the new requirement will include testing for proficiency in the application of Agile Methodologies (50% of PMP Exams?). More importantly, I happen to know (I have many contacts in major industries) major players such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Boeing, Raytheon, and various pharmaceutical companies are all looking to migrate their systems over to an agile-based project model. It has come to my attention that executive management teams have been chartered by the CEO’s of these companies, with making the transition to the “Agile Way” going forward. Assuming my assertion is true, it is in your best interest to start preparing now if you expect to stay current given the paradigm shift slowly but surely coming our way. Change is hard but it is necessary!\nAfter poring over 11 comparable guides, here is what I came up with:\nAgile Rating Criteria:\nA) Cost.\nB) Dual Purpose Feature (DP). Answer depends on whether Guide offers Guidance on Agile project selection/management *AND* Agile PMI-ACP compliant test questions that cover all chapters.\nC) Level of Comprehensive test (where applicable) and content coverage.\nD) How consistent chapter focus is aligned with percentage of test questions.\nE) Multiple methods of presenting the same material to increase comprehension through redundancy.\nF) How well diagrams, tables, graphs, charts, and presentation material were utilized to provide a contextual understanding of various Agile methodologies.\nG) Coverage of test taking strategies for deciphering test questions.\nH) How well test questions answers are explained at the end of each chapter.\nI) Using Real-life case studies to “drive home” complex and/or complicated constructs (look it up if you don’t know the difference between the two).\nJ) Online test bank availability.\nGUIDES I PURCHASED AND REVIEWED:\n1) Author Jack Lead: “Agile Project Management: How to master Scrum, Kanban and all Agile tools to optimize the organization, Performance, Quality and Results. Includes Kaizen guide to grow step by step and achieve goals. (4 Stars).\n2) Author Jack Lead: “Project Management: This book includes Lean Guide + Agile Project Management. Practical guide for Managing Projects, Productivity, Profits of Enterprises or Startups with Lean, Scrum, Agile.”(4 stars).\n3) Author Jeffrey Ries: “Agile Project Management: The Complete Step-by-Step Beginner’s Guide to Agile Project Management & Software development: Lean Guides for Scrum, Kanban , Sprint, DSDM, XP & Crystal, Book 1.”(4 Stars)\n4) Author Brian Will: “AGILE ADOPTION AND TRANSFORMATION, PRINCIPLES, CHALLENGES, AND PITFALLS.” (4 stars).\n5) Author Peter Measey: “AGILE FOUNDATIONS, Principles, practices and frameworks.” (4 Stars\n6) Author Sam Ryan: “Agile Project Management: 2 Books in 1: Beginner’s Guide & Methodology. The Definitive Guide to Master Scrum, Kanban, XP, Crystal, FDD, DSDM. (4 Stars )\n7) Author Joseph Phillips: “ALL-IN-ONE PMI-ACP Agile Certified Practitioner, Exam Guide. (dual purpose) (5 stars)\n8) Author Hans Wendel van Hespen: “Agile methods: Accurate match! Which agile methodoloy is most appropriate for your IT-Project?” (3 ½ stars)\n9) Author Sohel Akhter: “Agile Project Management, Aligned with Agile Practice Guide, First edition, PMI and Agile Alliance.” (dual purpose) (5 stars).\n10) Author Konnor Cluster: “AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT, Learn How to Manage a Project with Agile methods, Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.”(4 ½ Stars)\n11) Author PMI: “Agile Practice Guide.” (4 ½ Stars)\nAfter careful review of the above Agile publications, My top 3 picks are as follows:\n1st place: Author Sohel Akhter: “Agile Project Management, Aligned with Agile Practice Guide, First edition, PMI and Agile Alliance.”(dual purpose) (5 stars).\n2nd place: Author Joseph Phillips: “ALL-IN-ONE PMI-ACP Agile Certified Practitioner, Exam Guide. (dual purpose) (5 stars)\n3rd place: Author Konnor Cluster: “AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT, Learn How to Manage a Project with Agile methods, Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.”(4 ½ Stars) *AND* Author PMI: “Agile Practice Guide.” (4 ½ Stars)\nHonorable mention: All 4 Star ratings\n***Special Note: I chose not to include publications targeted for Beginners (don’t want to be accused of comparing apples to oranges).\nFor the record, I will be posting these evaluations for 1st 2nd 3rd place and “honorable mention” reviews only.\nFor those of you wondering why I chose to evaluate 11 Agile Guides. The answer is simple, rating these guides not only enhances my understanding of the various Agile based project management methodologies, it also allows me to continuously improve my knowledge base relative to the current advances being made in the field of project management, across a wide array of industry types. It’s all about staying informed lest you want to get left behind.\nIn closing, I hope you all find my effort to provide guidance, when selecting an Agile Guide Publication, useful!",
    "Excellent condition. I recommend the spiral format. No issues with the printing from the manufacturer as described in previous ratings.",
    "Helped me pass the PMP certification exam",
    "There are many questions that have been created from the information contained within this guide. Read the practice guide at least 3 times, and then find some good situational questions on udemy.com to practice with. Also, read both books PMBok 6 & 7 at least 3 times.",
    "Very helpful material for those who is pursuing PMP. Must must have this. Printing could be better but content is top notch",
    "This helped me understand Agile better and it covered terms / concepts not covered in my Bootcamp material.",
    "This was a required text for an agile class at Georgetown. I found this text so easy to read and follow. When reading I followed along and really immersed myself in the subject. I’m keeping this on my bookshelf for future reference. Thank you for making agile easy to learn.",
    "This book covers Agile concepts by PMI for the PMI-ACP exam. Great for scrum masters, product owners and all other Agile team members. This book provides a great overview of Agile.",
    "For the price, its a very short book indeed and while the latest version of the PMI ACP exam has been updated to be in-line with this book, I really don't think you need to buy this book as everything is covered in the recommended reading list and exam books already on the market. The reason for leaving the review is that I saw a number of one star reviews saying they struggled to read the pages due to them being on grey paper (an anti-copying measure). The pages and type are crystal clear on my copy which I've read under a variety of lights, so I don't know what's happened to other people's copies. Or eyes....",
    "Ho acquistato un libro, il cui venditore risultava essere \"premium-books-europe\". Purtroppo ho commesso l'errore di non controllare il profilo del venditore perché, dal nome, mi aspettavo fosse in Europa; invece... sorpresa delle sorprese... quando mi arriva il libro... il postino mi chiede 9.90 euro per le spese di sdoganamento. Controllo i timbri sul pacco, ed in effetti risulta spedito da Miami, Florida, USA! Sarebbe buono avere maggiore trasparenza sui costi.",
    "I unfortunately received a copy with several significant printing errors. This made the first 2 chapters of material extremely difficult to read. The only available option was to return the book for a refund - no replacement option. Not ideal, as I am currently studying for my certification.",
    "I am studying for my PMP, I was worried this book would not be useful as I did not find the PMBOK guide 6th edition easy to read.\n\nI was wrong, this is a great book, and great for obtaining an understanding of agile practices. It may take some extrapolation to apply to everyday work, but I found it useful for the purposes of PMP studying",
    "Page quality is not good at all . It has the confidential watermark on all pages. I doubt if it’s original"

    "I read 'Exactly What to Say' in one sitting this morning and it's one of the best books I've ever read - crystal clarity, easy to read, fast, and great examples!\n\nIt had been recommended to me by Dan Henry as part of his Raise Your Prices Challenge, and right after the class this morning, I had a conversation with my tenant. She had previously been offered one of my programs, but said she didn't have the money.\n\nThen last night she reached out asking if I did a specific thing. I said I'd never done that particular thing, but I should be able to figure out how using the tools I know.\n\nSo this morning, after the challenge class, we had a casual conversation. Using Dan's strategy, I was easily able to incorporate the Magic Words and help her identify her surface and deepest goals, discover and answer her real objections, and show her how we could work together.\n\nAs a result, she enrolled confidently in my $20k Law of Attraction Mastery Program, and we are both very excited to work together!\n\nThank you for writing such a simple yet effective book!",
    "Loved the examples that show how a slight change in words can make a big difference.\n\nLooking forward to more books.",
    "Insulting simple, I can not believe this has even one positive review. The book feels the need to explain everyday quotes such as 'Don't worry' and 'Just one more thing' - and doesn't even do a good job of it, no evidence is used to support any of the claims, I know the evidence exists because I have read it in better books - this is just laziness and a cash grab attempt by the author.\n\nThis book/long article perfectly captures everything wrong with salesmen who use pressure to make customers feel uneasy enough to the point they buy. One line in the book says 'Yes becomes the path of least resistance' - literally encouraging making people say yes to avoid awkward conflict. Another line saying how people will do as you ask or will feel embarrassed. The time of the Salesperson have been and gone, for these exact reasons. The Author even has the audacity to be entitled enough to express his hatred towards customers who put off making a decision in the moment, as he has used his valuable time trying to peddle them something.\n\nIf you want a book that explains all of this books contents with actual evidence and support for the claims, read The Choice Factory - if you enjoyed this that book will blow your mind.",
    "I didn’t like this book much. There were some interesting snippets but much of the content feels like a stereotypical sales book from the 1980’s. Unfortunately I spent much of my time cringing at the content because of its over simplified and stereotype sales content. If sales people used these techniques on me they’d lose credibility immediately. If you are interested in a good ‘how to sell’ overview book then don’t buy this. Instead buy Jim Keenan’s ‘Gap Selling’.",
    "If you're new to sales or are an experienced sales professional who is currently going through a slump, then this short book may help you get back up and running. You may be asking yourself, why are words and scripts important? Well think of your favorite actor or actress, and the chances are that he or she has gone on to make millions by simply delivering the right line/script at the right time and now you have the opportunity to do the same.\n\nIn the book, you'll find 23 small scripts and each script is provided with examples of how you can present it to your prospect.\n\nHere are examples of the three I've decided to use this week:\n\nNumber 4: How Would You Feel If? How would you feel if your competition passed you?\n\nNumber 10: Two Types of People: There are two types of people in this world: those who leave their personal financial success in the hands of their employers and those who take full responsibility and build their own futures.\n\nNumber 14: Most People: Most people in your circumstances would grab this opportunity with both hands, knowing that there is almost no risk.\n\nWhat have you got to lose? Buy the book, implement it and get ahead of your rivals.",
    "I’ve recently acquired about 20 copywriting books, as you can see am still a long way from conjuring up “magical words “ to transform my writing and getting people to do what I want! . Nevertheless, this book is one of the three I’ll recommend. Why? You can quickly weave in Jones techniques into your own writing style. I only gave it 4 stars because it’s not the best, but Jones draws influence from other writers- so he covers a lot. My issue with the book is it’s mainly suited fto be used when writing a product description/review rather than blog posts. How To Write Better Copy is the go to for blogging or other forms of writing. The Adweek Copywriting Handbook: The Ultimate... is surpasses this book (in terms of selling products) but the information in both books are interchangeable. Exactly What To Say only cost me 99p on kindle, and for that price I took a lot of information away, and in only a few hours (finish the whole book in one day- which was yesterday).",
    "Poorly written and far too focused on manipulating people to do something they don’t want to. I expected this may focus on things like reciprocity, win-win etc. Save your money and buy another book that will teach you how you can change yourself....specifically away from the types of behaviours this book encourages."

    "This is a very well researched story about a group of greedy entrepreneurs whose ambition eventually brought them to the attention of the Feds. Convoluted in its methodology and grandiose in its orchestration, the title of the book captures well the nature of the scam. A gangster enterprise from its very inception catapulted a cadre of family cohorts from the side streets and by ways of the big cities to the forefront of the New York Stock Exchange. Special attention should have been paid to the brokerage houses that polluted the airways and pandered to the innocent investors who succumbed to the hype. Aside from the intricacies of the original fraud, I found the manipulation of the IPO and the tales of insider trading most ignoble. The Syrian community of Brooklyn is made up of charitable individuals who dedicate themselves to doing good deeds for those in need. But, this handful of rotten apples has tarnished their reputation leaving so many unsuspecting individuals empty handed.",
    "It’s been a while since I’ve had a book I couldn’t put down or wait to get back to. Highly readable, especially when it comes to untangling complex fraud, family relationships, and legal procedure. It has so many wonderful levels — subcultures, family, finance, marketing, personalities strong and weak, and a relentless chase by so many for some acceptable form of justice and truth. An instant classic.\n\nA mild criticism: I don’t buy the author’s conclusion that “Eddie was a brilliant man, probably a genius.” Chertoff had it right - Eddie would never have succeeded were it not for fraud. It was the glue that held the business together. His accounting schemes to create the illusion of growth and success were as crude as the sleazy store tactics and just as short sighted. They had to fail eventually. The speed with which the whole enterprise was dissolved in Chapter 7 after the takeover demonstrates that he built nothing of value. To me, that’s neither brilliance nor genius. It’s retail-level criminality.",
    "I knew some of the people and was involved in some of the events. The book captures the nature of the people at Crazy Eddie and the events that brought it down. It is fun to read. If you are familiar with the phenomenon of Crazy Eddie it will bring back memories and reveal some crazy things you didn’t know. If you didn’t know about Crazy Eddie, hold on for a wild ride.",
    "I grew up on east 5t street in Brooklyn during the 50's and knew many of the folks chronicled in this beautifully written book. Mr. Weiss filled in a lot of details that I was unaware of. I couldn't put the book down. Thank you Mr. Weiss.",
    "I lived in Long Branch, NJ right next to and part of the Deal 'S-Y' enclsave, so I was following the story as it happened. Fascinating.",
    "I am the former CFO of Crazy Eddie and one of the main participants in the fraud. I read ‘Retail Gangster: The Insane, Real-Life Story of Crazy Eddie’ cover-to-cover. I can attest to its accuracy. This readable book includes 27 pages of end-notes that meticulously document all of the author’s sources.",
    "When my family moved from the Bronx to Connecticut my parents loved many things about being in the country. The peace, the quiet, the distance from relatives. However they hated one big thing, shopping. Caldor's and Bradlees were nothing to Alexander's and electronics well at the time nobody beat Crazy Eddie. I knew the show from commercials, a man screaming about prices and how crazy he was and that they practically giving things away. No cartoon was without an ad. Not that my father trusted them, he just thought that as a New Yorker born and bred he could deal with them. But my father was wrong, there is no dealing with crazy, or greed. Retail Gangster: The Insane, Real-Life Story of Crazy Eddie by writer and reporter Gary Weiss is a profile of this company and family who fooled everyone including themselves.\n\nEddie Antar was both a dreamer and a schemer, from a family who made money in small shops that catered to locals and stealing from tourists. Eddie graduated from schlocky cheap items at Times Square to his own little store in Brooklyn where he began to advertise his cheaper prices and selection with an ad campaign that was both annoying and mesmerizing. Success lead to scams, not charging sales tax, bait and switching, buying merchandise from outside the normal ways, warranty and insurance fraud. Aided by family and loyal cadre of workers, both willing to do whatever Eddie asked right and usually wrong, the company began to grow, and sales at least in one pair of books looked great. Soon Wall Street took an interest, and the small scams grew bigger and bigger just to keep up. Soon Eddie's greed, demons, his family and the price of success caught up with him, along with a federal investigation or two.\n\nGary Weiss has written a book that is nostalgic, humourous, and makes a reader angry at capitalism. The book is really well written with a very good story, man does well, fools Wall Street flees the country with false passports and a Swiss bank account. A true rags to riches tale about the 1980's. Mr. Weiss has the ability to make complicated legal and financial terms interesting and clear, plus explain family dynamics and like in New York during this time. There are very few heroes, but few villains most just seem like people caught up in greed, and not wanting to admit that they were being fooled. Like Wall Street. The big takeaway was the scams. Much to many to list. Eddie tried to scam everyone and everything in everyway possible. Customers, the government, family, his own kids. Eddie wasn't crazy he was just obsessed with getting ahead. And Mr. Weiss really captures that sense well.\n\nA great book especially for people who grew up in this era, or watched TV and remember those ads well. Also there is a lot about other retail giants that are not around, which reminded me a lot about growing up, Syms, the Wiz Uncle Stevie's even Ponderosa Steak House. I knew that I would enjoy the book since I remember well shopping at Crazy Eddie, but Mr. Weiss has a real gift for capturing that whole era. Eddie was crazy, so of course people would shop there and save money, because they were putting something over on somebody, not our fault if he was Crazy, we want ours. That was Wall Street and Eddie's entire retail philosophy. Something that still hasn't changed",
    "I was somewhat aware of the Crazy Eddie type advertising back in the day. But I didn’t know about the story of the electronic business and what it really was, namely a scam run by the owners. It reached some amazing highs, but eventually imploded. Wonderfully researched and an interesting read. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily."

    "Cole was just a suggested tweet on Twitter to me one day not that long ago. I honestly thought he was a mid 20 to mid 30 year old who has been homeschooled at first. He is that well spoken and thought provoking.\n\nI’m an adult who realized I was thinking exactly as the adults Cole has worked to prove wrong all his life.\n\nWe are starting homeschooling next year (though have we ever really not been homeschooling our children?) and I want them to feel the support and encouragement that Cole has.\n\nThis was a fantastic read and such a great reminder that we’re all limited only by ourselves more than anything. That our children are capable of so much more than we let them learn or prove.\n\nI highly recommend reading this.",
    "Great book. Loved how he describes a basic education system for Gen z. It’s perfect and the result is a fully matured young man way ahead of his adolescent peers.\n\nGood book to read if you want an idea of the possibility of homeschooling, or just a general idea of how to raise a child to be their own, fully realized, person.",
    "My bf read of the recent passing of this incredible young man and asked me to buy the book for him. He loved it so much and was telling his mother about it. She was so fascinated we ordered another shipped to her.\n\nI have not read it yet. However he couldn’t say enough good things about this young man and his view on education, goals etc.\n\nI never see him read books. He finished this in an afternoon. It was a very quick read.",
    "What an amazing young man! Saddened that we will never know what else he would have done in life but thankful that he wrote his story that continue to be an inspiration to many people.",
    "I read this book in one sitting - 125 pages. It intrigued me because I learned about it on a hard news site (Citizen Free Press). It is an autobiography by a 14-year-old young man who never knew the word \"can't\". The book is tinged with the subjects of homesteading and self-reliance - can you imagine that? A 14-year-old starting and building his own companies and becoming a magnificent DIY'er beginning at around age 4. I'm not kidding! At 6 he was tearing apart engines and rebuilding them! Wow, wow! Underlying all this enthusiasm to 'get er done', he was researching a major environmental disaster and planning how to stop it. I don't want to give it all away so buy it because it will reinforce your faith in this generation. Sadly, Cole died in a kayaking accident but will be remembered by everyone who reads his life story. Guaranteed!",
    "I obviously am one that has come to accept that young people generally don’t have a lot to give. They are in learning mode. Preparation time if you will.\n\nBoy does this young man prove that some, maybe many, given the opportunity are capable of a lot more. It makes me think I missed my chance as well.",
    "Breaks my heart that this boy is gone, but his lessons of how to encourage your kid to grow into an effective, capable adult will be his legacy.",
    "Cole Summers was a free spirit that was raised without parental restraints. An industrious self-starter, his accomplishments were varied and wide reaching, certainly an over-achiever for his limited lifetime. He was destined for a life of significance. We can only imagine what great heights he would have achieved. This short book is worthy of your consideration.",
    "I am a mum who is definitely guilty of having said to her son \"You can't\" far too many times. Cole's words are a real gift, enlightening and inspiring. I'm looking forward to re-reading it with my boy.\nIt's an excellent parenting book without wanting to be one, not only for home-schooling families but for all families really."

    "This book is very helpful",
    "The content of this book is weak, simplistic and annoying. If you are used to reading books by reputed authors on related topics (e.g. Richard Thaler, Chris Voss, Michael Lewis, Danny Kahneman), then you will be frustrated by this book.\n\nReading this book (or, to be factually correct, reading the first 41 pages of this book) felt like wandering into a pub, and finding yourself having to listen to the ramblings of a failed Polytechnic professor, half-cut at the bar. I’m not a negotiation expert (instead, a rather reluctant practitioner), but I’m also 100% confident that if I were to follow some of the “takeaways” recommended here, I would soon be divorced and/or unemployed.\n\nI should also have noticed it was self-published (usually a warning sign), which also makes the physical experience really “village” (see Urban Dictionary if not familiar with this description, and see image for “chapter title” example - if you can spot it).",
    "Not overly helpful. Very basic level or entry level and repetitive content\n\nWas hoping it would help with understanding the less expressive and less communicative types of people so we can get along (better) & understand one another better, and work or study or live etc alongside one another as efficiently as possible. However, unfortunately so far this book has not offered me much that I did not already know from other books or ted talks. This from someone who very much enjoys reading personal development books. That said, I will try to update the review if remainder of the book gets better.\n\nIf this is your first attempt on finding out information on this topic, you may well like the book and find it fairly useful",
    "Please don’t buy this book, save your $, I bought this because it caught my eye and was rather intriguing, not to mention all the good reviews.\nAfter reading this (which was a struggle) because it is pretty boring, I find this book a huge disappointment.\nThe book goes on and rambles about things to look for which are just common sense you will already know, the reason I write this review is because in the book after all the “tips and tricks” it teaches you they also state that none of what they are rambling about has been proven nor is there ever been any connection to Thai info being true.\nBig let down",
    "Very interesting and easy to read",
    "Durch die Rezensionen und die Beschreibung des Autors hatte ich mich auf das Buch gefreut.\n\nSchlussendlich muss man sagen, dass sich das Buch wie eine lose, oberflächliche Ansammlung von Erkenntnissen anderer Bücher liest.\n\nAndere Bücher sind deutlich besser geeignet um in die Thematik reinzukommen."

It provides clear actionable steps though it does tend to repeat itself quite a bit.\n\nWho Should Read It?\nAnyone that is struggling with procrastination or with take the vital first step in getting the important things done.\n\nHow the Book Changed Me\nThis book has helped me to see the importance of doing the difficult tasks first and prioritizing my ugly frogs. I have already seen results in working from tasks lists in this way in that I find myself more motivated to get things checked off. I feel better about tackling the big things on my plate first as this gives me a sense of accomplishment.\n\nMy Top 3 Quotes\n1. Failure to execute is one of the biggest problems in organizations today. Many people confuse activity with accomplishment. They talk continually, hold endless meetings, and make wonderful plans, but in the final analysis, no one does the job and get the results required.\n2. One of your top goals at work should be to get the highest possible return on your investment of your mental, emotional, and physical energy.\n3. In the final analysis, nothing will help yo more in your career than for you to get the reputation for being the kind of person who gets important work done quickly and well.",

If your mind wanders or it's usually ambiguous about a project, this is the go to book for getting clarity in life and work. Go eat that frog!",
    "„get into action“ „just do it“ – if I needed to summarize the book into one sentence these would probably fit. Mr. Tracy shows in just a little above 100 pages (or 21 chapters plus one conclusion chapter) how to get forward to do the most important thing we humans usually try to avoid. This small book contains several hints / tips on how to „eat that frog“, the first thing you should do in your daily (business life) to become more valuable as entrepreneur or employee.\nWhile I liked the short easy way on how things were presented, how the topic was approached in general, it always felt (for me) like being on the surface, deeper thoughts on how and why are passed. The author does not forget to mention other, in my opinion, great writers of the subject, but there are not many notes for the reader to dig in.\nThis does not impact the central message, however, and the book is a great start on becoming more active, being more selective on which tasks should be started. But, as said earlier, for readers, who wish to dig deeper, I would recommend Napoleon Hill, Steven Covey, Cal Newport etc. Great starter, I read the above mentioned authors before, changing the sequence definitely makes sense. I deduct one star for the almost non existent note section.",
    "Ho letto questo libro in lingua originale e mi è piaciuto davvero molto. Mi hanno conquistato i tanti consigli concreti, fattibili e passo a passo, spiegati in modo diretto senza tanti fronzoli. Tracy ci guida a cambiare approccio al \"To Do\" quotidiano e al \"Procrastinare\". E' di facile e veloce lettura e scorrendo le pagine l'effetto è da subito il desiderio di mettere in pratica ciò che si legge. Ha cambiato il mio modo di affrontare le piccole e grandi sfide di ogni giorno. Lo consiglio vivamente.",
    "The key premise is that if we ate a live frog first thing in the morning, everything else would be easy compared to that. It's a good reminder to concentrate on the most important task instead of getting mired down in the smaller, unimportant ones.\n\nThe author gives 21 steps to getting things done.",
    "I am not a procrastinator of any sort. I like to make lists and get those lists completed. It's absolutely a sense of accomplishment to do so. I purchased this book to actually assist in modifying some business practices in my office. I work as an Operations Manager for a home remodeling company in Seattle.\n\nThere were ways the business could have had a better success rate had we changed the way of doing things, just a little! And this book provided me with a great way to tweak the internal processes just enough to better how each admin performed in their key roles. Great read!"

    "I've reread it in 10-15 year intervals when I hear an otherwise bright modern reference it. It's a quick essay-length airport reread. I revisit it to try to re-understand what a modern referencing mind imagines is said.\n\n'Meditations' is as pure hubris as the classics get IMHO. Over the years and exposure to deep diving history, reflecting on life's experience, and adding cumulative historical knowledge, 'Meditations' diminishes in stature the more you discover. It's an almost comic book superhero genre. It's peculiarly obscene in time and place.\n\nMarcus Aurelius thought highly of himself and goes to lengths to say so. But, did he write it? Was it commissioned propaganda? Aurelius's other literary contexts reflect a roughshod handle on rhetoric. What did his contemporaries (not on his payroll) have to say? The supposed author Aurelius was a monster then. He'd be a monster now. History tells of an unbounded psychopath. It's a mystery how Meditations become a touch-point in human literary force.\n\nBackgrounder: Marcus changed his name from already high noble Marcus Antoninus. But, Antonius was inadequate for the man. He chose to switch names to Marcus Aurelius Augustus, i.e. 'Marcus the Golden Emperor.' Who does that? He conjured a myth from among more ancient Caesarian concepts of man-god. He pronounced himself as a fresh God-Emperor at a time when jaded citizens write that they knew better. Aurelius occupies a unique place among Teutonic, Xtian, and Parthian genocidests. None to noble from his deathbed, he curses his enemies with his last words as if he'd learned nothing from a life of futile, empire-ending war. His relentless bankrupting campaigns were repaid 200 years later by the Teutonic tribes his campaigns enraged to presage a far better Roman Gothic Emperor Theodoric. Some historians claim his reign as the 'Height of Empire' when it seems clear that it was his doing that begins the end of the Western Empire. I've come to view Meditations as a benchmark of crazy non-normative psychology. I do hope those that admire it read it in the context of the man's reality.\n\nMy first read was in Latin with a #2 Ticonderoga pencil translation 50-some years ago. As a kid, I thought he was pretty cool. Not as succinct or primitive as Julius. Nothing like Livy or Virgil. I liked Marcus Aurelius. I thought he was a genius. Marcus Aurelius wrote like a man to be heard. Such was my youth. There is a line of classical thinking that Meditations was a propaganda piece paid to be written to make the monster appear, human, a wise everyman worthy of remembrance. The movie Gladiator amplified the myth to render Aurelius the kindly, deep thinking father even better than Meditations could accomplish.\n\nTo explore the man and his reign makes it easier to refute Meditations as authentic. Recall that this wise every man had sired and shared power with his delightfully insane son Commodus who would go on to forever end Pax Romana. Marcus Aurelius, for all intents, could be fingered as the single point failure to the French 18th-century notion of the Fall of the Roman Empire (it didn't 'fall').\n\nThis translation is quite interesting. Latin in time and place can be understood in so many ways. Meditations are written 200 years after \"Comments on a Gallic War\" and Livy's 'Histories' for the advanced Latin student. Try your hand reading the US Constitution to discern a universal Founder's intent in our modern context. One can see firsthand how language and word meanings morph, fade, and add a new texture. Translations in the modern linguistic context are always appreciated.\n\nHays delivers one of the best translations ever on word for word, phrase for phrase context. There are a handful of pivotal verse specifics to compare. Gregory Hays nails it. This is likely the last time I'll re-reconsider Meditations. I suppose everyone needs to come to a grasp of it if they claim to have read it. More than a few folks that claim its 'wisdom' have not meditated on it.",
    "This is my favorite of all of the copies of the Meditations I’ve seen. It’s nicely bound with a high quality well-decorated dust jacket. The translation is also great for modern readers.",
    "Excellent book with wisdom that can be cherished by a wide range of people",
    "Great book! Highly recommend it!",
    "I said what i said, and notice i didn’t say the meal tastes good. But it makes you feel good, and if you eat it regularly, your quality of life starts to improve dramatically. So eat up.",
    "The product was shipped in a box with protection older reviews should be ignored. Again this review is for the hardcover version which is the correct one advertised by the post. Keep in mind the other covers are not the correct version.",
    "Read from several historians that this translation captures more of the intent and meaning than most. Easier to understand, but, is it the correct meaning, and do I get the proper understanding? Don't sweat it. This is not going on your final grade. It DID allow me to NOT have the issue most deliver where there is something confusion, portions in parentheses or italics to give a literal translation when I do not know the language's syntax. My best example is Italian, noun then adjective. Bibi cafe means 'drink: coffee' and is a popular enough soft drink... but translated into English as \"drink coffee\" (a verb).\nThis guy takes pains to be better at current modern meanings and in a decade or three may be as helpless as those older translations from the proverbial dawn of modernity.",
    "One of the biggest pitfalls of literature (that should be read by everyone) is if something is translated from one language to another - the translation matters! A LOT! Many books are translated from another language into old English which no one but scholars understand. This happens with Dante's Infero, etc. You end up feeling dumb because you can't understand, and end up not only not reading it - but being turned off by even trying! It can make you feel very limited. THIS translation is perfect! Poetic and easy to understand. Everyone should read it.\n\nI would also say if you are weary, tried too many bad translations, or are impatient, start with \"Book 2\" in meditations. That's what you're looking for. You won't be disappointed.\n\nSide note: You can read any book and enjoy it. Find out which translation is updated best for modern English. There are lots of sources online (including regular forums) where people/articles will say which translator is easy to read or what they prefer.",
    "I pre-ordered the ebook edition, then noticed the paperback was available immediately and cheap. So I ordered that too. These are NOT the same book!\nThe paperback is a print on demand version of the 2002 translation by Gregory Hays and includes an introduction, endnotes, and index of persons. The print is badly formatted in parts (see messed up fonts in 2nd photo) with some low quality sections (see 1st photo).\nThe Kindle version does not credit the translator at all and includes no introduction or notes. But seems to be a more literal translation (likely by someone else).\nFor example:\nPhoto 3 from the paperback Hays translation: \"1. From my Grandfather Verus. Character and self-control.\"\nPhoto 4 from the kindle version: \"From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.\"\nAmazon sort this out! They are not the same product.\nI've still given it 3 stars as I will likely use both versions. In effect the paperback is a study notes summary of the longer translation in the ebook.",
    "I believe the other reviewer noting that this Kindle edition is not the Hays translation from 2002 is correct. It appears to be the George Long translation from 1862. That's right, 1862. It is poorly formatted and cheaply done. There is no mention of the translator nor the publisher for that matter. It looks like in order to purchase a Kindle edition of the Hays translation you have to seek it out separately on your Kindle device or in the Kindle store, but at the moment (March 2021) the one linked to the paperback and hardcover editions of the Hays translation on Amazon is not that book.",
    "Kindle version is not the Gregory Hays translation, it is some 19th century translation full of thous and thys, do not purchase the Kindle version if you're expecting a modern translation",
    "Aurelius touches upon aspects of the soul and mind that I never considers before reading this book. Very happy about my purchase!",
    "You get what you see - Please, check the kindle edition. You will get exactly this terribly formatted \"book\" which is an insult to the excellent new translation by Gregory Hays. The formatting is so terrible, it impacts the redability :(\nDo yourself a favour: Buy the traditionally published version.\n\nExzellente Übersetzung von Gregory Hays.\nDie Print-Ausführung ist genau das, was in kindle abgebildet ist: Dilettantisch und lieblos formatiert. Ich verstehe nicht, dass Hays das seiner wirklich lesenswerten Übersetzung hat antun lassen. Die Formatierung ist so miserabel, dass sie sogar die Lesbarkeit negativ beeinflusst."

Read and re-read Marty’s book and steal at least a few of his insights for the interview - you’ll sound like a genius.\n\nSome of the topics that resonated for me (I’m sure there will be different ones for you):\n\n-Product management is distinct from other essential roles: design, engineering, product marketing, and project management (Chapter 1).\n\n-Two inconvenient truths that often cause failed product efforts are: at least half our ideas are just not going to work (customers ultimately won’t use it - which is why you need customer validation early in the process) and it takes several iterations to implement an idea so that it delivers the necessary business value (Chapter 6).\n\n-The three overarching product development principles from Lean and Agile which help you create successful products are (Chapter 7)\n-Risks should be tackled up front, rather than at the end.\n-Products should be defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.\n-Its is all about solving problems, not implementing features.\n\n-You need a team of missionaries, not mercenaries to create the smallest possible product that meets the needs of a specific market of customers (Chapter 8,9).\n\n-A product manager must bring four critical contributions to their team (Chapter 10):\nDeep knowledge\n1) of your customer\n2) of the data\n3) of your business and its stakeholders\n4) of your market and industry\n\n-Product managers (PMs) need product designers - not just to help make your product beautiful - but to discover the right product (Chapter 11).\n\n-Typical product roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations (Chapter 22). It is all too easy to institute processes that govern how you produce products that can bring innovation to a grinding halt. You need to try to wean your organization off of typical product roadmaps by focusing on business outcomes, providing stakeholders visibility so that they know you are working on important items, and by eventually making high-integrity commitments when critical delivery dates are needed (Chapter 60). Part of this is managing stakeholders which includes engaging them early in the product discovery process ideally with high-fidelity prototypes (Chapter 61).\n\n-Products should start with a product vision in which the product team falls in love with the problem, not the solution (Chapter 25).\n\n- Strong product teams work to meet the dual and simultaneous objectives of rapid learning and discovery while building stable and solid releases in delivery. Product discovery is used to address critical risks: (Chapter 33)\n-Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it? (value risk)\n-Can the user figure out how to use it? (usability risk)\n-Can we build it? (feasibility risk)\n-Does the solution work for our business? (business viability risk)\n\n- PMs can’t rely on customers (or executives or stakeholders) to tell us what to build: customer doesn’t know what’s possible, and with technology products, none of us know what we really want until we actually see it (Chapter 33).\n\n- While Amazon has a culture of “write the press release first”, Marty suggests PM should write a “happy customer letter first.\" Imagine a letter sent to the CEO from a very happy and impressed customer which explains why he or she is so happy and grateful for the new product or redesign. The customer describes how it was changed or improved his or her life. The letter also includes an imagined congratulatory response from the CEO to the product team explaining how this has helped the business (Chapter 36).\n\n- Product managers need to consider the role of analytics and qualitative and quantitative value testing techniques (Chapter 54).\n\n- What it really means for a PM to be the CEO of Product is testing business viability: listening to Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Finance, Legal, BD, Security, etc. before building the product (Chapter 56).\n\n-Establishing a strong product culture requires (Chapters 66-67)\n-Innovation culture: compelling product visions, strong product managers, empowered business and customer savvy teams product teams often in discovery\n-Execution culture: urgency, high-integrity commitments, accountability, collaboration, results orientation, recognition, strong delivery management, frequent release cycles\n(and it is hard to do both)",
    "Marty Cagan is a very comprehensive author when it comes to product management concepts and methodologies - he leaves no stone unturned and no milestone unexamined. Though I question the reality of the work environment he's able to live in (dedicating 3+hrs to customer visits per week would leave me with no time to get near term revenue-generating PM work done), he makes a strong point to consider operating more closely to your customer and prioritizing your work around what makes your customer's life easier. A basic concept for sure, but one that has long gone by the wayside in the Fortune 100 companies that I've worked for (HP and Xerox among them). He offers many options to achieve the objectives he's set forth in the book - don't feel you have to implement them all. Find what work for you company, your customers and your revenue model and use the trial and error method to determine which are a good fit. Overall, an interesting and quick read that we found was a good book club book for our PM team that got some great conversations going around what we agreed with and didn't like.",
    "I struggled with how to review this book.\n\nI didn't actually want to review it but my experience was so different than most of the reviews I read prior to buying it, I felt I should add a bit of color.\n\nMy TL;DR review is that this book has been $15 at different times and I bought it when I got a $3 special offer. Based on the reviewer and the $3 price, it's worth an average 3-star review for 3 bucks. (If I had paid full price I would have given it 1 star.)\n\nIn reading this book it's clear the author of this book was a very successful product manager who has largely moved on to bigger and better things. He mostly spends time listing possible org structures, roles, techniques. He doesn't get into product manager subjects until half of the book is over. When he does get into it, there's value in a less-than-wikipedia sense. He covers things which are very important (I've been creating and managing products for more than a decade), but he covers them superficially and you'd probably be better off googling a topic than readaing his thoughts about it. This is not an insult- I say probably because he clearly is not PM anymore... there are no real insights here. You are not going to be inspired or rethink anything you've learned from this book.\n\nThis brings me to the style. This book is two parts...\n1) the table of contents and\n2) the contents.\n\nThe TOC is valuable and anybody updating the wiki page for product management would benefit from reading this book. It's well organized and covers a lot of ground.\n\nThe contents. This book is written in conversational style. It might even come across as notes from a course lecture. Outside of the TOC/outline, there is very little structure to it. The author goes on every tangent and segway you could imagine. Many times in a topic he will spend more than half of his content hedging and contextualizing what he is about to say, and then finally gets back to the topic title. Very frequently I was disappointed by the actual relevance to the chapter for most of the content in the book.\n\nNote- I'm not saying his contextualling and hedging isn't valuable. The author has a tremendous sent of knowledge and experience. He's not particularly great at articulating it or presenting insights. The book reads mostly as somebody who is upselling you on something else that is not on the book. There are very few personal stories, everything is very abstract and opinionated but there is no depth, humor.\n\nI think the thing that is most important to me that was lacking. I'm an accidental product manager and entrepreneur. I have created products and businesses in multiple industries not because I was paid to do so but because I was trying to serve customers and a larger purpose and in order to do this, products were born. If you look at truely great product managers like Steve Jobs ([i used to list other people here, but some of them talk about themselves enough that it's not necessary]). Jobs wasn't just detail- he was- and he wasn't just big picture. He had a unifying vision and a soul. There is no vision or soul to this book.\n\nThat is not to say it's not worthwhile, if you know nothing about product management... this is an excellent starting point of things to research more. To the author's credit, he states several times (5-10) that he's not going to cover areas because they are better covered in other books. In a couple of places he provides other names of books. All of his recommendations are worthwhile, but he spends a lot of time saying very little that you couldn't find googling his chapter list.\n\nI think that's my final advice. The chapter list is free, so if you google parts that you know least about, are most interested in, or are most important.... you will probably find a lot more timely information, deeper insight and get a lot more from your time than you will from this book.\n\nI'd like to say that I'm going to eventually come back and do this. At this point I'm not sure I will. For me- outside of the price- what makes an ok vs a great professional book is how soon I act on an idea in the book. If I'm acting on ideas in the first chapter, that is a really great book. If I'm bubbling up a series of ideas that I could act on half way through the book, that's a very good book. This book is so superficial, so impersonal, so lacking in originality... I almost feel like if you read this book and take it to heart you're constraining yourself in ways you will never appreciate.\n\nSo this is the basis of my 3 star rating. Lots here, but probably can find more in other places for same or better price.",
    "Great book for those who want to improve their understanding of the Product Manager profession.",
    "Cada una de sus partes describe muy bien el proceso de la gestion de producto pero creo que la partes 4 y 5 ya son muy largas y aveces redundantes. Pero en general es un libro que tienes que leer si eres PM",
    "Each chapter is only a few pages long so it’s an easy book to read a little of and then have a think about what’s been covered or to step away from if you get interrupted. There’s plenty of different areas covered and the whole book is quite thought provoking.",
    "Great read by Marty Cagan which covers the entire Product Management area.\n\nWhilst a significant amount of the book is focused on the importance of solving customer problems - outcomes over outputs, which is the theme of a lot of product books around, there are 67 chapters covering:\n\n> The different growth stages of tech companies, lessons and some really good success stories from Product Managers of Google, Adobe, BBC, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple\n> The challenges and the reality of being a Product Manager\n> The different roles of the Product/Agile team, supporting roles and additional leadership roles needed as you scale\n> Tones of advice about product vision strategy and KPIs\n> Huge amounts of discovery and transformation techniques\n> Stakeholder management\n\nAnd it also accurately describes the top reasons for loss of innovation and loss of velocity.",
    "Product Management is such a poorly understood and yet essential discipline in software development but Marty and his team are both pioneering and setting the highest possible standards. This book is incredibly well thought through and generous in providing the tools, skills and methods necessary to be a first class Product Manager. It will save you money by enabling you and your organisation to focus on building the right product sooner, a product which your customers will love - and pay for. I first bought the kindle edition then the audible and then got 2 hardback versions to lend out in the office hoping to get everyone on the same page.\nIt is the only book on Product Management that I recommend and I sometimes feel like I'm pushing it onto people but it really is that good.",
    "This is often quoted as the best product management book available. It has many short sections touching many subject ares critical for product management and I would definitely recommend it to those new to the role. For those with experience that have already read books, and done course on Product Management thry may find it lacking in depth.",
    "A great read. Marty does a top job of contrasting great product companies practices with the general populace. There are a great number of takeaways.\n\nSome things that weren’t addressed in this addition were things like measuring product manager performance; how discovery fits it with larger orgs need for business cases etc (in any detail); how things like stakeholder management is done with many product managers across many products when those stakeholders are the same individuals, or you have multiple stakeholders (eg. VP sales) in multiple geographies. This isn’t a knock on the book, but there are always realities that need to be accounted for.\n\nDefinitely worth reading for any product manager or product leader. The techniques listed are extremely helpful and the clarity that comes through the first half of the book on org design, objective setting etc is brilliant.\n\nThanks."

    "This is a book that you can read in a day or so but you will want to go back and re-read things and reflect further.  I absolutely loved this book\n\nYou may or may not have read Marx and Engels' book of similar name - don't bother - **_this is the one that you need_**.   So many insights emerge clearly - not least the Real Spectrum in which Capitalism (properly defined) is at the other end of the spectrum from Politics: Right, Left, and all the \"isms\", not to mention authoritarianism.\n\nThe definitions chapter is important - Mark and Tsvetski have really taken time to clarify correct definitions for terminology that you assume you know but don't.\n\nCapital and Capitalism, Communism, Inflation, Deflation, Entropy, Fair(ness), Fitness, Forcing Function, Freedom, Monopoly, Parasite, Proletariat, Public vs Private Property, Time Preference and Value are among that terms that you will understand better and with that enhanced understanding the chapters that follow make even more sense.\n\nI found the discussion on Equality and Fairness to be particularly insighful; you want equality of opportunity NOT equality of outcome - the latter leads to the Woke nonsense that we see everywhere today.\n\nMark and Tsvetski do not just criticise communism and politics rather they propose solutions.  The real struggle is between individual autonomy, sovereignty and responsibility versus the collectivist tendency toward group identity politics, rights, entitlements and co-dependencies. Between productive cooperation and nihilistic coercion.",
    "I enjoyed this book.\n\nIt addressed a massive topic by unpacking in easy to understand key points.\nKey points that we should consider due to events unfolding before our eyes in real-time.\n\nThe book did a good job of creating a foundation and disambiguation of terminology and hence beliefs such as capitalism & free markets as it relates to individual freedom.\n\nWhat I particularly liked is the authors' proposal of solutions. You can find much criticisms about the current state of society everywhere, but rarely do you see any brainstorming about potential solutions. They brought to my realization that there is a 3rd option different from the societal experiments we have seen.\n\nAlso the coverage of Bitcoin's philosophical and crucial political importance was more than interesting. A strong case is made for it being the best candidate as a currency \"for the people\" and not just tech & investment.\n\nOne thing I would have liked more of is elaboration on Austrian Economics. I only have a basic knowledge of this and was curious to see what the authors thought in more detail. It did motivate me to learn more about it.\n\nOverall, I was engaged and read the book in one sitting. I would for sure recommend this book to anyone who cares about our current economic future and livelihood.",
    "Great! Great! Book. This has been needed for a long time. We must stop the ongoing push toward socialism and this book will definitely help counter the destructive work of Marx and Engels. Of all the writings along this line that I have read Svetski and Moss have done the best. Although this book crushes socialistic norms is also “not” an attempt to go back to some conservative ideals from the past, it is a move forward, clarifying capitalism as it truly is with the freedom and potential derived from it.\nRead and share, it’s our best way forward.",
    "UnCommunist Manifesto cuts thru the normal superficial discussions of the world's problematic symptoms to address root problems of centralized power and misaligned incentives --- the first principles approach methodically and starkly reveal why society is adrift and forces self-analysis on one's own values and motivations. Change is in the wind and humanity will either revert to it's natural state of challenge, with freedom balanced with responsibility and risk or a world dominated by centralized power promising comfort but delivering soul-crushing misery doled out by petulant bureaucrats. Choose wisely, your children and children's children will live with the world we pass on to them...",
    "The world needs more books like this written. Short, concise and impactful. It can take you an hour to read, but you'll want to do it over a longer period of time because each paragraph packs an intellectual and philosophical punch. You'll want to read a bit, then stop to ponder it. Come back, read a little more and do the same.\n\nThe more of this we consume, the greater our chance to overcome the narratives that are forcing our entire society toward regression and immaturity.",
    "I was expecting a good book, given what I already heard/knew of each of the authors, but this was full-on great. I've never read Marx's 'Communist Manifesto' but I love the concept of taking that book as the framework for writing its complete opposite and publishing the result. Eye-opening to say the least, and more than a little inspiring. It's also short enough that you can easily read it more than once, which I probably will. Highly recommend.",
    "This book is a real tool in the arsenal of the individual who believes society moves forward as a result of free people who take responsibility for their actions and add value to the world by serving others. It counters the collectivist and “oppressor and oppressed” philosophies that push a “burn it down” agenda.",
    "Short, concise yet chuck full of wisdom. Please help spread the message contained in this book. The world desperately needs it. Svetski and Moss are doing Gods work. Bless you both.",
    "The average person's default definitions and meanings that they use to navigate and evaluate the world, and everyday life, are worn-out copies of narratives, instructions and messages that they have been carrying throughout their lives since childhood. Reinforced or weakened through interactions, or buried under new narratives collected second-hand or absorbed from the never-ending output of low-signal noise emitted from the mass media.\n\nThe instinct for survival and the pragmatic conclusions of living in a society will auto-regulate our programming to a degree, but how often do you deliberately stop and assess where theses narratives are taking you? And what has this got to do with a short book on capitalism and communism?\n\nWell Aleks Svetski and Mark Moss have stopped and assessed the narratives and will show you how the popular chatter on these topics is undermined by a lack of understanding and clear definitions and that getting back to the first principles and meanings of what these concepts mean - capitalism, free markets, private property, sound money, sovereign individuals, autonomy, coercion, collectivism, and more - is the key to true hope and progress in human freedom and flourishing, unhindered and unpoisoned by the flawed ideas of marxism, collectivism, statism and all their derivatives downstream.",
    "Great read on Economics, Centralised Power, Class Struggle, and the future worth looking forward to. This book discusses big topics in enough detail without getting into the weeds and keeps the reader interested for more.\n\nThis is the type of book you can read in an afternoon and share with friends and family.",

    "Summary of the key concepts in the book:\n\nConventional Wisdom: Make learning easy\nBest practice: Design learning with desirable difficulties\nDiscussion: “Learning is deeper and more durable when it is effortful.” “Difficulties that elicit more effort and that slow down learning… will more than compensate for their inconvenience by making the learning stronger, more precise, and more enduring. Short-term impediments that make for stronger learning have come to be called desirable difficulties.” “Don’t assume you are doing something wrong if the learning feels hard.” “Not all difficulties in learning are desirable ones. Anxiety while taking a test seems to represent an undesirable difficulty.” Slow down to find meaning. Always read prior to the lecture. “Training has to be engaging in order to hold employees’ attention.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Concentrate on one topic at a time (aka. massed practice)\nBest practice: Interleave different but related topics\nDiscussion: “Learning from interleaved practice feels slower than learning from massed practice.” While interleaving can impede performance during initial learning (tests taken immediately after exposure), interleaving has been show to boost “final test performance by a remarkable 215 percent.” In addition, “commonalities… learned through massed practice proved less useful than the differences … learned through interleaving.” “In interleaving, you don’t move from a complete practice set of one topic to go to another. You switch before each practice is complete… You need to shuffle your flashcards.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Reread material multiple times and in close succession\nBest practice: Space repetition\nDiscussion: “Repetition by itself does not lead to good long-term memory… It makes sense to reread a text once if there’s been a meaningful lapse [at least a day in between] since the first reading.” “The increased effort required to retrieve the learning after a little forgetting has the effect of retriggering consolidation, further strengthening memory.” “Design quizzing and exercises to reach back to concepts and learning covered earlier in the term, so that retrieval practices continues and the learning is cumulative.” Spiral upward at increasing levels of difficulty with each re-exposure.\n\nConventional Wisdom: Reread to lock-in knowledge\nBest practice: Focus on effortful recall of facts or concepts or events from memory (aka. Retrieval practice)\nDiscussion: “Retrieving knowledge and skill from memory should become your primary study strategy in place of rereading.” There are many methods of retrieval practice. Elaboration, expressing new material in your own words and connecting it with what you already know to find new layers of meaning, for instance by writing daily summaries, is the most effective. Moreover, “cultivating the habit of reflecting on ones’ experiences, of making them into a story, strengthens learning.” Essays and short answer tests are the next most effective durable learning strategies because they involve “Generation… an attempt to answer a question… before being shown the answer”, followed by practice with flash cards, reflection, and, least effective though still useful, multiple choice or true/false questions. To foster this, convert main points into questions to answer during subsequent studying rather than (or in addition to) highlighting and underling,\n\nConventional Wisdom: Conduct pop-quizzes and high-stakes post-testing with a goal toward errorless results\nBest practice: Conduct frequent, predictable, low-stakes testing (including pre-testing)\nDiscussion: “Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt.” In fact, “making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridges to advanced learning.” In addition, frequent quizzing – especially when quizzes are announced in advance - actually reduces learner anxiety. With respect to anxiety, the peak-end rule applies; people judge experiences based on how they were at the peak and at the end. Appreciate that “errors are a natural part of learning.” “Make quizzing and practice exercises count toward the course grade, even if for very low stakes.” Set “clear learning objectives prior to each class.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Match instructional style to each learner’s preference\nBest practice: Match instructional style to the nature of the content\nDiscussion: While people do have preferred learning styles (ex: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile), empirical research does not support the notion that learning in your preferred style leads to superior outcomes. “When instructional style matches the nature of the content, all learners learn better, regardless of their differing preferences for how the material is taught.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Memorize\nBest practice: Extract underlying principles (aka “rule learning” and “structure building”)\nDiscussion: “It is better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution.” “Mnemonic devise are sometimes discounted as tricks of memory, not tools that fundamentally add to learning, and in a sense this is correct. The value of mnemonics to raise intellectual abilities comes after mastery of new material.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Learn abstract concepts\nBest practice: Learn using methods and examples that are concrete and personal\nDiscussion: “The kind of retrieval practice that proves most effective is one that reflects what you’ll be doing with the knowledge later. It’s not just what you know, but how you practice what you know that determines how well the learning serves you later.” Simulations and role-playing are excellent techniques. “Difficulties that don’t strengthen the skills you will need, or the kinds of challenges you are likely to encounter in the real-world application of your learning, are not desirable.” “Practice like you play, because you will play like you practice.” “Sustained deliberate practice… [is] goal-directed, often solitary, and consists of repeated striving to reach beyond your current level of performance.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Read without pausing\nBest practice: Spend 40% of time reading and 60% of time “looking up from the material and silently reciting” what it contains.\n\nConventional Wisdom: Provide immediate feedback\nBest practice: Delay feedback\nDiscussion: “Delaying the feedback briefly produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback.” That said, receiving immediate corrective feedback is better than receiving no feedback at all.\n\nConventional Wisdom: Review all concepts equally\nBest practice: Disproportionately focus on the least familiar material (aka dynamic testing)\nDiscussion: To increase frequency of practice on less familiar material without completely ignoring the most familiar material, use the Leitner box method. “Think of it as a series of four file-card boxes. In the first are the study materials… that must be practices frequently because you often make mistakes in them. In the second box are the cards you’re pretty good at, and that box gets practiced less often than the first, perhaps by half. The cards in the third box are practiced less often than those in the second box, and so on.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Accept that IQ is fixed\nBest practice: Focus on mindset\nDiscussion: “Average IQs have risen over the past century with changes in living conditions... IQ is a product of genes and environment” including increased stimulation, nurturing, nutrition “One difference that matters a lot is how you see yourself and your abilities. As the maxim goes, ‘Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.’” Adopt a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset; “consider your expertise to be in a continuing state of development.” “Success is less dependent on IQ than on grit, curiosity, and persistence.” Knowledge is a foundational element of creativity, critical thinking, and application. “The upper limits of your performance on any cognitive or manual skill may be set by factors beyond your control, such as you intelligence and the natural limits of your ability, but most of us can learn to perform nearer to our full potential in most areas by discovering our weaknesses and working to bring them up.” “Achieving expertise in any field if particular to that field… The central idea here is that expert performance is a product of the quantity of and the quality of practice, not of genetic predisposition, and that becoming expert is not beyond the reach of normally gifted people who have the motivation, time, and discipline to pursue it.”\n\nConventional Wisdom: Trust your own sense of mastery\nBest practice: Calibrate your judgment\nDiscussion: “Calibration is the act of aligning your judgments of what you know and don’t know with objective feedback so as to avoid being carried off by the illusions of mastery that catch many learning by surprise at test time.”\n\nNote: This book practices what it preaches with lots and lots of repetition. The authors are up-front about that but it does get well... repetitive.",
    "I have not been able to read this book cover to cover because a good amount of the concepts require time and practice for them to become a habit and be second nature to you. However, since I have a semester left before I graduate with my bachelor's, I do not think I have enough time to incorporate the concepts into my study technique arsenal and therefore, I am shelving this book as a next-year read when I will have the time to try out the concepts and see if they will work for me before I go back to grad school. I did find a few concepts to be interesting like Exhibition, Interleafing, and Spaced learning, and those will be the only ones I can use right away as they are not hard to do.",
    "This book brought me so much insight on my new journey for dental school. I learned how to learn again and I appreciated the different examples of learning in various careers or school. I think I will have this book in the back of my head every day for the rest of my life. Yeah, it was that good",
    "Overall, I got value out of the book. It provided a good overview on learning and learning strategies.\n\nOne of the premises is that we learn better through repetition rather than linearly progressing through the material. The book aims to do that with the writing. The premise may be true, but the resulting book reads very convoluted. The same message keeps getting repeated - not in tying things together way but pure repetition. The repetition is hard to read so frequently, and it's easier for the eyes to gloss over it.\n\nThe key premises of the book are:\n- Repeatedly reading and highlighting doesn't work: The familiarity with well written text creates and illusion that we actually understand it.\n- Cramming and long study sessions simply feed the short term memory. The material will soon be forgotten.\n- Actively engaging with the material will increase retention. (The book praises \"recall\", e.g. quizzes. However without explicitly saying, yet describing it, any active engagement, e.g. summarizing in your own words or asking yourself comprehension questions will increase retention.)\n- Spread out learning over time and intersperse topics. Partially forgetting and re-learning may feel frustrating but the effort in re-learning is actually very effective to retain the knowledge.\n\nThe book fills in the premises with more detail and adds a couple more. It then provides studies and narrative stories to illustrate those, but that's the core message of the book.\n\nThe book make a great deal that what it teaches is \"not intuitive\" and that \"effortful\" learning is better. To be honestly, the book confirmed my intuitions rather than disproved them. I had realized that all the last minute cramming in high school got me grades in subjects that I know nothing about now because it all went into the short-term memory. I've also jealously looked at classmates highlighted books but was unable to make that method work for me. The book confirmed that it doesn't work.\n\nWhat the book calls \"effortful learning\" is also not the best phrasing. It differentiates that someone whispering you the lesson into your ear in Swedish to make you look up every word doesn't help, even thought it would be a lot of effort. What the book calls \"effortful\" would be much better described as actively engaged learning. The more you actively engage the more the brain retains it.\n\nThe little narrative stories of how a pilot learns to fly may seem silly and contrived, but I kind of liked them. Seeing how different professions learn their skills was interesting to me.",
    "Very well written book.",
    "Das Buch hat wenig Inhalt und viel Text.\nDie Schlüsselkonzepte sind weder neu noch besonders außergewöhnlich, man könnte sie auf einer Seite zusammen fassen.\n\n-Wir lernen am besten fürs Langzeitgedächtnis, wenn wir Pausen zwischen dem lernen einlegen.\n-\"Einbrennen\" von Informationen durch simple Wiederholung ist nicht effektiv, führt aber zum Irrtum, dass wir glauben alles zu wissen.\n-Wenn wir uns selbst Tests stellen, bleiben die Informationen besser im Gedächtnis und wir haben ein besseres Urteil über unser Wissen.\n-Karteikarten sind hilfreich um sich selbst zu testen.\n-Benutze eine Lernkartei(Leitner Box)\n-Mnemotechniken können helfen arbiträre Informationen zu lernen.\n\nHier, habe euch 20€ gespart. Der Rest des Buches ist Füllmaterial und verwässert die Informationen.",
    "This book is potentially a life-changer for me. It's been about a month or so since I read the contents and started applying the core concepts of it into my own life. I cannot stress enough the difference I have noticed in my retention ability - this, on a very difficult topic, (C++ and Problem Solving).\n\nTo give a little background into why I write the review, and to hopefully encourage others who might be similar to invest in this publication:\nI always wondered why I couldn't transfer an uncommon ability to absorb trivia into other parts of my life, especially in an academic context. When I was in high school, I was an exceptional sponge of knowledge, and placed well in national trivia competitions. Even after high school, I won pub quizzes as 'One Man At the Bar\". Why couldn't I transfer this 'skill' to more important and worthwhile pursuits?\n\nI'd always been pretty relaxed (to the point of horizontal) in my approach to studying, with a toxic combination undermining my progress. I had a natural disinclination to study, as well as an acceptance of second best, all anchored down by an abysmal sense of self esteem. Despite all of this, I always reassured myself that I could achieve things if I 'actually' tried, and stayed safe in the knowledge that \"if I really work at it, I could definitely do/learn it.\" Failures in anything were handwaved with 'I didn't try hard enough', which may or may not have been truthful - it's difficult to objectively analyse.\n\nHowever, having worked hard on eliminating the self-esteem problems over the last year, and setting the bar a lot higher for myself in terms of what I'd like to get out of life, I noticed I had surprising difficulties in retaining knowledge on C++ and Programming. I had assumed that sustained study with purpose and direction would finally allow me to 'take the handbrake off' on my learning, and find a better career in programming. It came as a rude shock to see me fail to grasp and retain information that, while not necessarily easy, is certainly something that other people seem able to master in a much shorter timeframe.\n\nAfter a little research into what might be slowing me down (it wasn't intelligence, memory, lack of interest, ADHD, etc...), I found this book - and I now realise I simply had never learned how to study properly! Put succinctly: I had never needed to! I more or less crammed or desperately squeezed what info I could into my head before any tests/assignments (some of which, looking back, I very badly let myself down in). On one occasion, I can remember being dishonest in an official exam, although with zero benefit from a moral or personal perspective.\n\nAnyway; this book has helped me retain very difficult information in a very short time frame. I'm finally able to reel off the kind of complicated knowledge presented in books like 'C++ Primer' (incidentally, an excellent book!) in the same way that I could casually recall trivia like country capitals, the monarchs reigning during certain historical events, or the creator of specific pieces of art.\n\nCertainly, this book will not turn one into a genius overnight (or indeed, ever!) - AND there is 'work' to be put into studying and the use/creation of spaced-repetition flashcards...but just find what works for you. I cannot recommend this book enough, and look forward to moving through life with the handbrake finally removed :)",
    "Great recommendation by Ali abdaal",
    "I've been an educator for over 25 years and can assure you that this book is the best guide to efficient learning in existence. The last chapter alone is worth more than the sum of everything else that I've ever read on how to learn efficiently. A wonderful, original, insightful and priceless book.",
    "I like the book overall. The tips themselves are great for students and the scientific studies mentioned are great for both educators and scientists working in cognitive psychology. The main issue I would have with the book is that it drags on unnecessarily by invoking long-winded stories that, in my opinion, add next to nothing to the substance of the book. It's a 250-page book that could be reduced to around 100-150 pages without the stories, but well worth buying overall.\n\nMy advice when reading: extract the key points using sticky tabs/flags/highlighter and type those up as a step-by-step guide for specific forms of studying and then print those off to stick on the wall."

    "Thomas Sowell is a living legend. Arguably one of the greatest and brightest minds of our day.\nIf you're going to read one book on the subject of economics, read 'Basic Economics'\nMr. Sowell does an incredible job discussing and explaining the topic in a conversational format. I hated econ before I read this book.",
    "Thomas has a true talent for making what can be a difficult and seemingly dry subject understandable & interesting. He’s a national treasure on the order of his mentor, Milton Friedman. His selection of relevant, historic examples help this book read like no other book I’ve read or studied on this subject.",
    "Sowell makes seemingly complex economic issues seem so simple. He uses plain language and numerous examples to teach economics concepts to anyone willing to learn. This book was truly outstanding. I bought copies for family members to read!",
    "Dr Sowell has written something the average person can understand while explaining a subject many find too complex to even attempt to learn about.\n\nI don't believe in making people do things but this is something we all should read.",
    "This book is a masterpiece.\n\nWithout having to resort to a host of charts, graphs, or byzantine formulas, Sowell provides a very readable yet solid foundation for the layman to understand the basic concepts of economics. Often Sowell does this by exploring a public policy intended to either help a disadvantaged population or right a perceived wrong, then using hard data to measure the effectiveness of said policy after its implementation. Over and over, the ill-considered, economically-ignorant \"cure\" not only fails to provide the relief intended, but almost always makes the situation far worse than it was to begin with.\n\nCritics will accuse Sowell of siding with conservatives and castigating Leftist positions, but anyone reading this book will see that GOP politicians fall for most if not all of the same glaring errors of macroeconomic misunderstanding that their DNC colleagues/adversaries do. Sowell does not have a dog in the fight between the two main US political parties, despite what you may have heard. Reading his analysis, one gets the idea that reason and facts in evidence are all he is advocating for.\n\nI have two daughters, and in their teen years this book was mandatory reading for both of them. If you read through just the first five or six chapters with your adolescent children, you will be taking a major step forward in your efforts to raise responsible citizens who won't fall for the shiny baubles most politicians try to buy votes with. If more parents did this, public policy in the US might drift back in the direction of sound economics and basic, reason-led sanity.\n\nEvery home in America should have a minimum of one copy of this work on the coffee table at all times. I would recommend keeping spares on hand in case you strike up a conversation with a friend or relative who is open to the idea of grasping real-world, pragmatic economic concepts (I've purchased six copies in the last 2-3 years for this very reason).",
    "Grab your highlighter and spend time reading this amazing book. If you want to understand why we are in the mess we are in, take the time to find out what mistakes and lack of understanding in basic economics is devastating to our country.\nThis book should come with a warning label: WARNING: this book will cause a rise in blood pressure and may cause the desire to scream at politicians.",
    "This is a superb introduction to Economics, written without mathematical symbols or equations. It is written for the general reader and should be accessible to any interested general reader. It is a doorstop at nearly 700 pp. but it reads quickly and holds the attention well.\n\nTS begins with a single concept and plays it out in a multiplicity of contexts: resources are scarce and can be put to multiple uses. Wood can be used to make desks, paper, mulch, etc. Beginning with that notion he explores prices, markets, work, pay, time, risk, the national economy, international economy, and so on. He provides a brief history of Economics and even asks a set of questions that a teacher (particularly a home schooler) might utilize.\n\nBeginning as a Marxist, TS studied Economics with Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago. He is a 'Chicago-style' economist as well as one of the country's top public intellectuals. A few of his key comments will indicate his general orientation. He is skeptical of governmental intrusions and controls and is quick to point out the fact that many intelligent and educated people have a way of forgetting the basic laws of economics. Economics is often called the 'dismal science' because it has a way of undercutting wishes and dreams that may ultimately be delusionary. Rent control is a prime example of a 'nice' idea that inevitably brings negative results. Two lovely comments from his summation at the end of the book:\n\n\"Invidious comparisons and internecine struggles are the stuff of social melodrama, which in turn is the lifeblood of the media and politics, as well as portions of the intelligentsia\" (p. 633).\n\n\"Empirical questions are questions that must be asked, if we are truly interested in the well-being of others, rather than in excitement or a sense of moral superiority for ourselves. Perhaps the most important distinction is between what sounds good and what works. The former may be sufficient for purposes of politics or moral preening, but not for the economic advancement of people in general or the poor in particular. For those who are willing to stop and think, basic economics provides some tools for evaluating policies and proposals in terms of their logical implications and empirical consequences\" (p. 634).\n\nSince logic, reason and empirical argument are in particularly short supply these days, this fifth edition of a contemporary classic is particularly useful. Note that it adds a new chapter (Chapter 23) on international wealth disparities. It may just be the best chapter in the book, because it takes a subject on which we are endlessly harangued and approaches it by offering examples from across the globe and from the beginnings of history. This is characteristic of TS; rather than mucking about in simplistic controversy he offers material from across the social sciences, diluting the issues of their fiery (and often irrational) atmospherics and provides insights and examples from areas and times with which contemporary controversialists are often unfamiliar.\n\nThis is a must-read.",
    "(Zum Zeitpunkt der Rezension las ich 50% des Buches;\nNegatives kommt am Ende zur Sprache)\n\nDas Buch wurde von Thomas Sowell, der in den 1960ern als Schwarzer an Harvard studierte, und die affirmative actions aufs schärfste verurteilt, geschrieben! Alleine das ist Grund genug das Buch in die Hand zu nehmen.\n\nSowell erklärt sehr genau (teilweise zu genau) wie die Wirtschaft funktioniert, bzw. wie sich verschiedene Eingriffe des Staates in die Wirtkschaft auswirken. Er zeigt mit einer unglaublichen Anzahl an Beispielen aus den verschiedensten Teilen der Welt und zu unterschiedlichsten Zeiten, wie das Prinzip von Angebot und Nachfrage bis ins Detail funktionieren.\nMan merkt ihm dabei an, dass er seine Theorien nicht auf Ideologien basiert, sondern auf Beobachtungen des Marktes.\n\nEin Beispiel: Mietpreisdeckelung. Es hat mich zutiefst erstaunt, wie Sowell mit Beispielen erklärte, dass eine staatlich verordnete Mietpreisbremse mehr negative Konsequenzen nach sich zieht, als wenn man den Markt freie Hand lässt.\nNoch mehr erstaunte mich, dass alles was er über Mietpreisdeckelung in seinem Buch vorhersagt 1:1 in Wien beobachtbar ist!\nWenn ein Staat die Mieten deckelt passieren mehrere Dinge:\n\n1. Bauträger nehmen Abstand vom Bau neuer Immobilien, da der Immobilienmarkt einen der langsamsten Umschlagraten hat, Kapital also tröpfchenweise (über mehrere Jahre und durch kleine Zahlungen (Mieten)) wieder reinbekommt. Deckelt man Mieten, dauert der Umschlag noch länger. Und Bauträger bauern entweder in anderen Gegenden (wo sie entsprechende Miete für ihre Leistung bekommen), oder sie bauen Eigentumswohnungen (wo sie das Kapital sofort wieder bekommen, und das verlangen dürfen, was die Wohnung wert ist).\nMittel- und Geringverdiener können sich Eigentumswohnungen nur schwer leisten. Zudem werden kaum neue Wohnungen gebaut und die Meite in bestehenden Wohnungen ohne Mietpreisdeckelung steigt.\nLässt man hingegen dem Markt freie Hand, steigen die Mieten, aber dadurch steigen auch die Neubauten, weil Bauträger sehen, dass sich in dieser Stadt mehr Gewinn durch Mieten erwirtschaften lässt, als wo anders. Es wird mehr gebaut. Der Markt sättigt sich langsam und die Mieten fallen wieder. Bis der Bedarf wieder steigt. Simples Gesetz von Angebot und Nachfrage.\n\n2. Bestehende Wohnungen werden nur mehr an Menschen vermietet, die zuverlässig ihre Miete zahlen (können). Das heißt, dass man Nachweise über Einkommen vorlegen muss. Auch bevorzugen Vermieter höher Gebildete und höher Verdienende grundsätzlich, weil diese Gesellschaftsschicht am zuverlässigsten Miete bezahlt. Und diejenige, die eigentlich von der Mietpreisbremse profitieren sollten (Mittel- und Geringverdiener) bekommen erst recht keine Wohnung.\n\n3. Wohnungen, die durch die Mietpreisdeckelung unrentabel werden, weil die Betriebs- Renovierungs- und Erhaltungskosten die Mieteinnahmen übersteigen, werden nichtmehr vermietet. Die Vermieter wollen verständlicherweise nicht ins Minus wirtschaften. Dadurch verfallen Häuser und Wohnungen, die von Mietpreisbremsen betroffen sind. Die Stadt Wien löst dieses Problem zum Beispiel durch Strafen auf Leerstand.\n\nWarum werden also überhaupt Mietpreisdeckelungen von der Politik gefordert? Vassilakou forderte 2013 eine Miepreisdeckelung und Kern forderte sie 2018. Warum? Weil man mit dieser Polemik auf jeden Fall gutes politisches Kleingeld schlagen kann. Niemand zahlt gern Miete. Aber man sollte es als Service betrachten. Ich zahle schließlich nicht für ein Zugticket, weil ich keine Strafe zahlen will, wenn ich beim Schwarzfahren erwischt werde. Ich zahle für ein Zugticket, weil ich einen Service in Anspruch nehme. Aus dem selben Grund zahle ich auch gerne Miete, weil ich nicht auf der Straße schlafen will und dem Vermieter für seine Bereitstellung seines Wohnraumes an mich einen fairen Preis zahlen möchte.\nUnd das bringt mich zum letzten Punkt:\n\nSowell lässt sich in einem Satz gut zusammenfassen: The allocation of scarce resources with alternative uses.\nDiesen Satz liest man alle paar Seiten einmal. Er wird zum Mantra. Das erste Mal habe ich ihn noch unterstrichen, aber weil ich ihn so oft las, ging er mir in Fleisch und Blut über.\nIm Endeffekt geht es in der Wirtschaft um die Verteilung von begrenzten Resourcen, die auch andere Verwendungen haben.\nBeispiel Wohnraum. Nicht jeder kann in der Haupstadt leben! Warum? Weil es nicht genug Platz für alle gibt. In einem marktwirtschaftlichem System regelt der (fluktuierende) Preis die Verteilung. Eine Wohnung auf der Kärtnerstraße ist nunmal teurer als eine Wohnung im 10ten. Weil die Nachbarschaft anders ist, weil die Lebensqualität anders ist, weil das Angebot unterschiedlich ist.\nEine Mietpreisdeckelung setzt mit einem Schlag alle Wohnungen auf das gleiche Preisniveau. Es ist nichtmehr der Einzelne, der mit seinem Geld abstimmt, sondern der Staat nimmt die Entscheidung, was eine Wohnung zu kosten hat, ab. (Hier lassen sich die sozialistischen Tendenzen der Abhanme von Verantwortung gut erkennen.)\n\nEin zweites (kurzes) Beispiel:\nIch las Marx' Kapital (in Auszügen). Er setzt den Wert von 1 Rock und 20 Ellen Leinwand gleich. Laut ihm kann man die Gleichung auch beliebig oft umkehren, also: 1 Rock = 20 Ellen Leinwand; und 20 Ellen Leindwand = 1 Rock.\nDas stimmt aber mit nichten.\nSowell lehrt: Dem Käufer einer Zeitung ist die Zeitung mehr wert als der eine Euro den er Zahlt. Und dem Verkäufer ist der eine Euro mehr wert als die Zeitung.\nEs gibt einen Moment des Profits, den Marx für gierig und ungerechtfertigt hielt (Denn warum soll ich mehr für ein Produkt zahlen, als es tatsächlich kostet?!), und Sowell für notwendig erklärt (Weil Gewinn/Profit Incentives sind um überhaupt Handel zu treiben!).\n\nInsgesamt gehört Basic Economics zu den drei besten Büchern, die ich je gelesen habe und die absolut jeder Mensch einmal pro Jahr lesen sollte!\n-Basic Economics; Thomas Sowell\n-Explaining Postmodernism; Stephen Hicks\n-Gulag Archipelago; Alexander Solschenytzin\n\nNegatives:\nZwei negative Anmerkungen zu Basic Economics:\nErstens, es ist extrem lang und es wir repetitiv (aber nicht weniger spannend), vor allem auch, weil die Mechanismen großteils die selben bleiben. Aber man könnte das Buch gut auf ein drittel zusammenkürzen und hätte trotzdem das meiste abgedeckt.\n\nZweitens, Kapitalismus hat nicht überall seine Berechtigung. Ich würde zu Sowell ergänzen, dass Privatisierung überall positiv ist, außer in Quasi-Monopolen, wie Wasserversorgung, Stromversorgung, Universitäten, Schulen, Krankenhäusern, Straßenbau u.ä.\nIch bin schon sehr froh darüber, dass ich in Österreich gratis in die Schule und die Universität gehen kann, und nicht 100.000de Euro Schulden machen muss, um mir eine tertiäre Bildung leisten zu können.\n\nUnd trotzdem finde ich das Buch ein MUSS für jeden mündigen Bürger! Allein schon um die Mechanismen und die Konsequenzen des Marktes verstehen zu können.",
    "This needs to be given to every 18 year old, the future of our economic prosperity depends on it.",
    "This was my first book on economics and i have to say it does what is says on the cover. It is in plain English with not much technical language so it is easy to understand. it also builds everything up in a sensible order.",
    "Thomas Sowell is one of the greatest men you've never heard of - a black guy from Harlem, who joined the US Marines from school in the 1950s, and became a mature student, and finally an economics professor, Sowell is a one-time Marxist who turned to the Chicago school.\nEven if you disagree with his conclusions, you will enjoy his clear writing style and the anecdotes and stories he uses to illustrate what can otherwise, and in other hands, be quite dry themes.\nI recommend his other books and his many YouTube videos.",
    "Thomas Sowell offers a clear and profound understanding of human society and politics through basic economic principles. Everyone who is of voting age should read this."

    "Passed Above Target in all 3 domains! Worth the money, minor editing errors, but in my humble opinion, the editing errors are nothing in comparison to the reward of receiving your PMP. This study guide is worth its weight in gold and a must have on your PMP or even CAPM journey. 5/5 stars and I highly recommend his Udemy course and TIA Mock Simulator.",
    "UPDATE: I did pass my exam last month, and I did do VERY well. I can't deny that this book is good as far as content goes. I was very nervous though leading up to the test based on the amount of errors I caught in the book, and the errors I caught on the online course. It overall proved to not be very relevant though. The most important thing to passing is having the mindset of a PM, which this book does a great job on fostering in the reader. For that reason, I am increasing it by a star from my previous review.\n\nThe content is solid enough. However, the amount of spelling, formatting, general editing errors is truly astounding. I am signed up for Andrew's course on TIA, but I am considering dropping it. I am watching his free videos and even his PowerPoint slides include glaring spelling errors. This man's gift is not quality control, I can say that. He probably bombed every quality process question on his PMP exam based off of what I am seeing in his editing skills to make a book seem credible. Even the subtext on the book cover is wrong! It should say, \"Includes PREDICTIVE\" not \"Predicated\" project management. Seriously, how was that missed!? I know some might say, oh well, you are just being snarky. To me, the quality of the writing gives off a vibe to the quality of the content. I want to pass my exam. His lack of caring about the editing of this book make me question his expertise. Sure, you can have 60+ certifications Andrew, but if you can't even write a book well to help others, I don't see why I should trust you.",
    "This material helped my past my exam first try, really helps understand concepts. It also comes with a code to unlock videos on the website and get the 35 credit hours needed for the PMI application.",
    "I have not taken my PMP yet but just going through the free course with Andrew has been great. He really goes into details and points out the most important things to know for the exam. Will update more when I take the exam.",
    "For those who are PMP Aspirants and reading this review right now, I highly recommend Andrew Ramdayal’s PMP Exam Prep Simplified Book! I just passed my 2021 PMP Exam two days ago for the first attempt and my results were all “Above Target” for all three domains. I started my PMP certification journey in Feb of this year, struggling to find good study materials, watching many YouTube Videos relevant to PMP Exam Prep. I have researched many PMP Prep Programs, classes, and books. Then, I encountered in Andrew’s YouTube Video. I truly feel that I was really lucky finding him and it was a game changer for me! Reading the 1000-page PMBOK is dry and hard to follow, so Andrew’s simplified version was very helpful to me to understand the important portions of PMBOK and gain foundational understanding of both Predictive and Agile concepts. Some people left reviews here indicating there are some grammatical & formatting errors. And yes, there are, but that was such a small issue to me when concerning the value of what this book could provide for me. Andrew’s book comes with 35 hours of online e-learning course with three mock exams, which is an amazing value when concerning the price of this book! As a matter of fact, Andrew even included all of his Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP) Course videos in his PMP e-learning course and they are truly valuable for the success of passing the PMP Exam.\n\nFor the preparation, I read this book for three times, and then used this book as my reference materials when I needed to clarify processes, tools, meanings, terms, etc. I also joined/watched all of his 2021 PMP Weekly Live Questions & Answers on YouTube every Tuesday evening from 7pm EST. Anyone can join in these study sessions. There are so many PMP Aspirants who join from all over the world every week, then we can ask questions to Andrew (and he actually answers for you!), and we go through 10 questions and review answers together (and he explains why incorrect answers are incorrect). We all support each other and encourage each other so that we can keep our motivation to pass the PMP Exam. I can truly say that the combination of Andrew’s book and his YouTube Live Sessions helped me tremendously for passing the PMP Exam with high scores! Andrew is an excellent trainer and he truly cares for those who are pursuing PMP Certification. And I would like to share the most important thing here: Read and Understand “The Project Management Mindset” in this book. Most questions in actual PMP Exam are all situational questions asking you what you would do as a Project Manager. The Project Manager Mindset that Andrew indicated in his book are the key for passing the PMP Exam! Without learning the PM Mindset, I am not sure whether I was able to pass the PMP Exam for the first try. So, good luck to everyone who are pursuing to earn PMP Global Credential, and thank you so much Andrew for all the help you have provided for me! You are the best!!",
    "Read this book cover to cover. Followed the rules and applied the mindsets. When I was stranded in the exam hall,I recalled the mind set principles and applied accordingly. Exceeded target on all domain. Thanks Andrew.\nDesmond from Nigeria",
    "So you are looking for a book to help you pass the PMP exam. Yes, as some people have stated there are some typos and the wording is odd in some parts. Which, for me, can be distracting - however, the organization and communication of the information and knowledge of the exam and processes is streamlined and concise. I won a free prep course from PMI and I completed it, but they literally read the Pmbok to me. I didn’t feel prepared to take the exam. Then the change came and I was stuck trying to navigate all of the new information. I came across this book and stalled on buying it for 2 months because I thought it was too good to be real. But, the course was free with the book and it was self paced but his strategy on taking the exam helped the most. I took my exam on 3/21/22 and this course and book were the reason I passed. As a FT working parent of a toddler, time is limited at work and at home, so this self paced and efficient delivery of the information was beyond critical. I completed the course in 2.5 months. I learned, I practiced the week before the test, read all of the questions I got wrong and did exactly what he said - I reviewed them and understood why I got them wrong. I cannot recommend this book/course enough or his teaching ability. When I took the test I flew through the questions and had ample time to review each section because I knew what I was looking for and processes’ functions. Thank you, Mr. PMBOK!!!",
    "Well framed and easy to understand.",
    "Picked this one after looking at various prep materials. Passed the exam in the first attempt. The book gives a good overview of what is a vast subject matter. Also used exam simulator from author's TIA website. The simulator is closer to the exam questions. Book has its shortcomings (e.g. editing, ambiguous answer choices), but nonetheless covers subject matter well. Note that the book is based on PMBOK 6th edition. I took the exam in November, which was still predominantly based on PMBOK 6th edition. But this might change in weeks and months to come. That would then prompt for the book to be updated and aligned with the 7th edition.",
    "This book and associated course is an excellent value, highly efficient way to prepare for the new PMP exam. It represents superb value with a full 35 hours of online training and practice exams that enable you to apply for and then pass the PMP exam. Presentations are clear and engaging and focus in on the content that you really need to know which enabled me to pass first time with all areas above target.",
    "I could have signed up for different courses or bought numerous books to learn about project management and to prepare for the PMP exam. Thanks to this book I didn’t need to. Do yourself a favour and buy this book which comes with an excellent associated e-learning course (only free with the book purchase) and save yourself a lot of time and a ton of money.",
    "I passed my exam yesterday morning and received above target in all categories.\nI started studying for my exam about a month ago and only used Andrew’s book, watched some of his videos and did his online mock exam.\nI don’t know if I would have passed without using his material.\nThis is a treasure book. The tips & tricks and PMP mindset are incredible.\nGet a copy of Andrew’s book, if you are serious about passing your exam the first time.\n%100 top notch book.\nWell done Andrew.",
    "Andrew managed to synthesise a complex subject into something which is very easily digestible. This book comes with a online course which brings everything to life. I want to express my sincere thanks to Andrew, as I managed to clear exam with 3AT today. His voice and teaching style made it possible for me to understand the real PMP material in the best possible manner. I just followed his course, this fantastic piece of literature and 2021 you tube videos in Andrew’s channel. All of them are fantastic.\n\nI owe this to Andrew. Recommended this to my reportees to buy this book to start preparing too. More power to him. Andrew you are doing a great job!"

    "Review: The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering\nby Marie Kondo.\n\nThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up is an absolute gas! I can’t find any other way to say it, but to use that old fifties slang word, for a very new book. I never knew cleaning up your crap could be this much fun.\n\nI’m not sure why I picked it up to read? I had lots of vital reading/research to get done for my own book. I certainly didn’t have time for someone else’s. But that title: ‘Life changing?’ Tidying up could be life changing? Oh, come on. It drew me in. I needed to know what this woman had in mind. On top of that, there was that word: “Tidying.” Who says that? Say the word out loud. Doesn’t it feel strangely wonderful in your mouth. These must have been the things that got me to purchase the book. But could what was inside keep me going?\n\nWell, I’m here writing this review, so you know the answer to that. There was much to keep me going and I found myself totally excited about the potential of ‘tidying’ up my apartment by the KonMari Method. There was really only one spot in my place that visibly looked messy and then, of course, there was the closet. But, I didn’t think this would be all that much of a job; I was eager to go on a spiritual journey by tidying up. I was ready to have my life changed through the KonMari Method.\n\nThis book is about much more than just “tidying up.” Let me share how to store your socks according to the KonMari Method. Kondo tells a story about an interaction she had with a client. (Professionally, she consults with individuals and groups about tidying up) She opened the woman’s sock drawer and “gasped. It was full of potato-like lumps that rolled about.” I found Kondos’ reaction hysterical; she certainly takes her work seriously. In bold, she says, “Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never ever ball up your socks.” This sounded like good advice even though I was guilty of this shocking behavior. I thought it made sense because you could stretch out the tops of your socks. But this was NOT Kondo’s reasoning:\n\n“Look at them carefully,” she says. “This should be a time for them (the socks) to rest. Do you really think they can get any rest like that?” I discovered I had been torturing\nmy socks and knew I couldn’t ever ball them up again. The guilt would be too\ngreat. I switched to the KonMari Method for storing socks. Wonderfully explained in the book.\n\nSome Tenants of The KonMari Method\n1. Do it all in one day (This prevents rebound)\n2. Take out all your things—and she means everything—and put them on the floor.\n3. Don’t even consider putting anything away. Discard first. (“Keep only those things that speak to your heart and discard the rest)\n4. Fold, hang and store by category, not location. (Sorting by location is a “fatal” mistake)\n\n5. The special order for tidying that you must follow is this:\na. Clothes\nb. Books\nc. Papers\nd. Miscellany (Kondo calls this komono)\ne. Mementos\n\nHow to Decide What to Discard\n\nNow, here’s my favorite part of the book. Throughout she tells you things like\nyou have to pick up every single item in your space one by one, hold it in your hand and ask yourself if it gives you joy. The question is NOT whether it gave you joy at some past time; the question is ‘Does it give you joy NOW.” If not, it goes in the Discard pile, but FIRST, you must thank it for giving you joy in the past. When I was only thinking about doing this tidying project, I found this humorous, later I thought of it as kind of cute and now I love the whole idea of it. Kondo thanks objects all day long and I’ve begun to see what a terrific idea that is. You begin to live in a world in which everything is alive and you’re always grateful.\n\nThere are lots more goodies in the book. These were the things that endeared me and made me decide to go on my own spiritual journey. I chose a day (Kondo says the day you choose to tidy up should be especially chosen. Make it an event) I decided that I would not just clean up that one messy area and the closet. I would, instead, use the KonMari Method to tidy up everything: my closets, my drawers, my desk, my medicine cabinet, the whole place.\n\nThe Results of My Own Tidying Up Spiritual Journey\n\nI started at seven in the morning and ended at ten at night when I could barely move. I was attempting to follow Kondo’s rule to do it all in one day to prevent rebound.\n\nI got a lot done in that day, but I did not finish. I was slowed down by deciding whether items of my clothes gave me joy or not. The only way I could tell was by putting them on. How I looked in the clothes was what generated the joy, not the simple fabric by itself.\n\nI probably saved some time on the books, however. A few weeks before I read Kondo’s book, I had organized my bookshelves and turned them into a kind of library giving each book its own place and recording the location on my laptop. As a researcher I often have to go back and read a section of a book. I am frequently frustrated by not being able to find a book among the many I have on my shelves. Sometimes, I’ve bought the same book a second or third time. It turned out that my organizational system wasn’t too different from Kondo’s, except there was one giant difference. She says you should throw out books you’ve already read because you’ll never re-read them. As a researcher I may not read a book cover to cover, but I’ll go back to the same section or sections often.\n\nKondo has a unique way of storing clothes. She recommends folding some blouses in a specific way, instead of hanging them on a hanger. This type of folding allows you you to stand your blouses up in the drawer. I tried it and I liked it. I also liked the extra space I had in my closet.\n\nBut as I said before, I didn’t finish in one day and I only have a studio apartment. I think someone with two or three rooms would have a worse time getting done in one day. Kondo doesn’t mention the bathroom, the kitchen, or the bedroom which I consider part of my tidying up.\n\nOverall, though, I learned a lot from Kondo’s book, and I think I’m going to continue using her approach in the future. Instead of risking rebound by doing the tidying I have left in short bursts over a number of days I have planned a second event for next week in which I will complete my spiritual journey.\n\nKondo says, “Tidying is a dialogue with one’s self…There is a significant similarity between meditation under a waterfall cascading down your body and tidying.\nPersonally, I’d rather have the waterfall, but I do love Marie Kondo’s approach\nto tidying up and life.”",
    "This amazing book by MARIe KONdo (see where Konmari came from?): The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying. Okay. The title seems a bit, uh, presumptuous, egotistical, dare say – altruistic. You may ask, “This book on keeping my house tidy will change my IMG_9508life?” We see what looks like hyperbole from other Asian-looking books. Perhaps those with Buddhas and golden temples may also scream (ever so quietly) life-changing claims, such as “Breathing, a life-changing perspective.” But, alas, this blog isn’t to criticize golden Buddhas, as breathing, er, is a life saving quality to embrace. Yet, good ole Marie Kondo, in her sweet and quiet – and somewhat extreme way – did change my life. We have all heard it before, “If you haven’t worn it for six months throw it out,” and we toss out certain items, but then the sentiment kicks in and we realize that we only wore it twice so it still has some life left in it. Even though it doesn’t quite fit right today maybe someday it will look on us how it looked in our mind’s eye when we saw it. That is not the Konmari approach, though. Her approach is just a slight paradigm shift.\n\n“Does this spark joy? If it does, keep it. If not, throw it out.” (page 47) This approach, although simple, is empowering and frees us from sentiment or allows us to embrace sentiment. Either, yes or no. I’m telling you, my four-year-old daughter had the easiest time with this approach as she doesn’t have as much nostalgia as us adults. HIMG_7673er ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ was quick and fast. I had more sentiment to her stuff than she did and actually kept some stuff she said ‘no’ to (grimace – that’s the mom in me). And she actually likes to keep her stuff tidy (well, as tidy as a kid can keep things) after this experience.\n\nBut the Konmari Method isn’t just the simple prescription of the question of joy. There is actually a formula. A way to ultimately and practically change your life. You have to do it in one go, or one set time. It took me three days to do it the first time. And I only have a 750 sq. ft. apartment, but I went through every nook and cranny. I have spoken to others who have read the book and tried the approach, but tried to split up the time. Maybe the kitchen one day and a month later the bedroom, but then kind of trailed off. Marie knows what she is talking about as she very strictly says to do it altogether. There’s a reason for this. It’s like (well, it actually is) doing a cleanse and doing it over a couple of days is much more beneficial for us and realistic for us to complete. If we take a weekend and schedule it, then we are actually scheduling rather than getting around to it ‘one day’. Yes, it will take some time, but afterwards cleaning your house on a regular basis is much easier and just keeping it tidy is easier. Plus, you save time in the long run as you know where everything is and where everything goes. Okay, saying all this, if you don’t keep it up, your house can start to go back to crazy land. That’s what happened to me as I became intensely busy and after several months I had to re-set. But this time it only took me six hours to Konmari (yes, I am using it as a verb) my house AND do major deep cleaning. Now, everything – even my files – are all nice and organized. I think every quarter I may need to do this, but at this time I also bagged up more stuff (as did Bella – we did have a yard sale, as well to share our former treasures with others and to have a lesson in the costs of goods), and it is just a regular process that will become easier and easier. (see my vlog and blog for video and pictures! [...])\n\nThere is also an order to this Method. Marie gives you a breakdown of which room to tidy and in which order. She even gives you a technique on folding clothes, hanging them up in the closet, and storing them. There are ways to use boxes so your stuff doesn’t scatter in drawers and ways to arrange your vegetables in your refrigerator so you see them and eat them. The only thing missing is that I don’t feel like she really goes into depth for kitchen storage and cabinets like she does for clothing. Maybe it’s because Japanese have way cuter, hIMG_7675igh-tech appliances compared to our American clunky ones, or that they have way smaller kitchens so just can’t store as much. Also, I don’t feel like she wrote very much about tidying with children, but that’s probably because she doesn’t have kids. That might be a great second book. Just saying. But, I still do love this book and it did make a very real impact!\n\nSo, how did this change my life? Well, simply being able to relax more in my house and to feel organized is huge. I primarily work from home so I require a tidy space. Also, this has changed my perspective on consuming, especially clothes. I don’t shop a lot anyway, as it is super hard to shop when you have a little one, but I do only shop at places where I know they have quality products. For clothes, I shop at Etcetera (the prices and styles are awesome and I know the owner and want to support her), and at Stilettos (they have good quality clothes and carry limited amounts). I only buy what fits amazingly and what is comfortable. After listening to Andrew Morgan on the Rich Roll podcast, I would also like to start looking at more ‘fair trade’ clothing stores online. I am veering away from quantity to quality and understand now that having fewer clothes, but those that actually fit right and don’t fall apart, is better than having a bunch of clothes that you can’t find in the closet. But, I would like to really examine where products originate from. Has the process for making them been caught up in the system of slave labor and sweat shops? I am so looking forward to watching The True Cost by Andrew Morgan and have it in my Netflix queue for the next movie I watch. I really believe that tidying is life-changing when done right, as it relates to environmental and Eco-friendly ways of living. It may sound strange, but when you are asking the question, “Does this item I am about to buy spark joy?” you really start thinking about many things: Is it comfortable? Does it have a purpose? Will it last? Do I actually like it? Will it be used? How was it made? Will it benefit others if I buy it? The fewer things you have and the fewer things you purchase, you ultimately have more respect for them and simultaneously demand more service from them. So that is how it has changed my life. With the American consumer industry – we IMG_7741just buy and throw away and buy more. Things are cheap so it’s okay if they fall apart, right? No, not at all. Things still cost money and that money is your time. For me, I learned how I was disrespecting myself and others by buying indiscriminately, and then crying about my credit cards (because all those $3.49 trinkets and $.99 bulls*** adds up pretty quickly). What tidying your house can do for you, can somehow lead to social justice empowerment in the strangest, yet most logical way. I know some of you just want to be able to see your bed and don’t want a social agenda. I get that. But, we all care about where our money goes and relish that moment of clarity when our house is in order. I’m just saying – you can get that and more.",
    "Throw away what you don’t need or love. When you use something, put it back where it belongs afterwards. There, in 2 lines I have told you all the advice this book has to offer. Honestly don’t waste your money, it’s a con.",
    "The writer asks us to hold each item in our possession in our hands and ask this question - Does it spark joy? If it doesn't, then discard it.\nI bought this book on several recommendations. But I should have asked myself if the thought of reading it sparks joy before buying it. This is the biggest take-away from this book. Now I find myself asking this question whenever I go shopping. If the thought of eating it, wearing it, doing it, doesn't spark joy, it's time for reflection.\n\nAnd that's it. The rest of the book is minutiae of how to discard and store things according to the Kon-Marie method which the writer invented which reads like a self-praising professor who gives boring lectures on how his past students did extremely well due to his teaching methods and how other teachers aren't that good or effective.\n\nThe irony is that this book is for hoarders but hoarders would never pick up this book. Or even if they pick it up, they would just pick it up to hoard it and not to read it. Or to read it and never follow through it. And if you are thinking of gifting it to someone you think has a hoarding problem, forget it. Hoarding is a psychological issue and unless the person navigates and cleans rubbish off their mental recesses, reading this book is just another dump in the ocean of mental junk.\n\nThe gist of the book:\n- Take up cleaning the whole house (or universe) at one go! This probably won't work if you live in a joint family with your kids and parents and parents-in-law because you'll have to spare a week or two for it- on your own without interruption.\n- Discard anything that doesn't spark joy. (Alas, I have bought things when I was younger and stupider and I have no spare monies to buy them again.) But this book maybe the one to go.\n- Sort things by category, not by location. Example, if you are sorting the clothes, then sort ALL the clothes in your house at once, not just in one cupboard. (This is great, but I have all my stuff in their exact location already)\n- Then the rest of the book is about how to store items in a cupboard (for which if you follow the book, you might need new cupboards with more drawers and clothes that don't wrinkle), how to clean the bathroom, how to arrange things in the kitchen, how to sort papers and documents and books, how to let go of gifts you do not use, etc. etc. etc. etc. till you get bored of reading the book about cleaning and decide to get rid of boredom by watching a movie and the idea of cleaning goes out of your brain and into the same vacuum of universe you were trying to clean.\n(P.S. I read the whole book)\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR:\n- People who already follow a routine cleanup of their stuff. For example, I have decided I'm only going to keep a certain number of clothes in my cupboard. I buy clothes ONLY when they get worn out or stop fitting. I do not buy clothes every Diwali or even for any close family member's wedding. Anything unused for 5 years has to go.\n- People who are quite organized or like organizing tactics like DIY storage solutions. This book is against storage solutions and instead focuses on discarding.\n- People suffering from some form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorders- we guys are already doing great at cleaning. No need to bend ourselves double and ruin our lives over it by reading one more book on it.\n- People looking for an idea on minimalist living. This book is not about minimalism. I thought it was so - going by the white cover with the word 'Japan' on it. But that is why we shouldn't judge a book by it's cover and people by their home-organizing techniques.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR:\n- People who like window shopping.\n- People who go shopping whenever there is a 'sale'.\n- People who 'have to have' something when they see something on a store window.\n- People who have a hard time discarding things out of guilt or any sentimental value.\n- People who have other people (usually mothers or wives or domestic help) to clean and organize things for them.\n- People who have overflowing wardrobes and bookshelves.\n- People whose lives are out of order (in existential crisis of some sort).\n\nSo I held this book in my hand after reading it and asked myself - Does this book spark joy?\nHell no.\n\nIt is a very easy read, but like a boring chemistry textbook unless you are really interested in the subject.\n[I bought a paperback copy of the book. The font and binding are good.]",
    "After reading the one star reviews of this book out of morbid curiosity, it seems there are three main complaints people have, and I'd like to address them as the basis of my review:\n\n1) \"I can't get over how she anthropomorphizes socks, treating them as if they have feelings and need to rest. This woman is out of her mind!\"\n\nSome people seem to be very hung up on the metaphors in this book. When Marie Kondo talks about socks (and other objects) working hard all day and requiring a proper rest when they’re put away, she doesn’t mean this literally. The point of all the anthropomorphizing in the book is to encourage you to think about your belongings differently and treat them with respect. For example, it’s easy to throw clothes on the floor of your bedroom or stuff them in a drawer thoughtlessly, but if you pause to consider what your clothes actually do for you and the value they bring to your everyday life, you’re far more likely to treat them with care and put them neatly back where they belong. Marie Kondo wants you to be grateful to your possessions, not for the sake of your possessions, but for your own!\n\n2) \"She doesn't explain how to deal with [specific category of items]. This book is worthless!\"\n\nOne of the primary tenets of the Konmari method is the belief that only YOU can decide which things to keep and which to throw away. Your own feelings, desires, and values are the litmus test for each item. Which belongings do you want to surround yourself with? Which belongings bring value to your life? Marie Kondo can’t answer these questions for you, and that’s the point! The book encourages you to take responsibility for your possessions, and, through the “celebration” of tidying, take control of them too. If you want/need some additional instruction on the tidying and storing process, I’d recommend her second book, Spark Joy, which breaks the broad categories mentioned in this book into more manageable sub-categories, and has more in-depth tips for storing items once you’ve decided what to keep.\n\n3) \"It's far too difficult to pull everything from one category out of storage all at once. I don't have time to do something like that!\"\n\nIf you’re looking for a “quick fix” to your clutter problem, one where you can go at it Saturday morning and finish by Sunday evening, this is not the book for you. From her descriptions of past clients, it could take up to a year for someone to completely tidy their home, depending on the number of items they own and the difficulty they have in recognizing which items “spark joy”. As a single woman living in a one-bedroom condo with not many belongings to begin with, it may only take me a few weeks, but if you’ve got a two-story house and family of four, you’d better prepare to be in this for the long haul. Of course, the reward for this massive investment of time and effort is the Konmari guarantee that you will have finished tidying once and for all, and your house will never return to its original cluttered state!\n\nI don’t know if this book has changed my life yet (I’m still in the process of tidying up!) but it has absolutely changed my mindset and my relationship to my belongings. It’s had enough of an effect on me that I’ll gladly proselytize about it to anyone who will listen! Check it out!",
    "Hello socks, good job today, let me roll you up and stand you vertically in my drawer. New clothes? Be sure to cut the umbilical cord from the shop (aka the price tag) so that they truly belong. Kitchen utensils rattling around in a drawer? Use a shoe box lid, shoe box lids are great for almost anything. Handbags, empty out every night and let them rest, they derserve a break. Stand everything vertically, oh sorry did I already mention that. Roll your tights up and stand them vertically in a swirl , much like the socks I mention fifty pages ago oh yes and don’t forget, bin everything and recycle nothing. Throw it all away, you don’t need it. Terrible book, that doesn’t quite describe how bad it is, you almost have to buy it to believe it!",
    "The best book I have read by far! I received a special offer from Amazon and thought....cover looks nice, I'll maybe read it at some point. Few weeks later I was bored and decided to give it a go. Well, I haven't put it down, my house is now exceptionally tidier and logically organised making me feel more confident, happy and focused. Even whilst in work I'm finding myself more productive as I'm clearing my workspace, carrying less items and feeling focused. I get things done more quickly, after all there are less items to clean, my house fees brighter and practical. I've told everyone I know about the book and they didn't believe me until they too read the book. I would recommend this if you are looking to develop a respectful relationship with items or have difficulty letting things go and it changes your cleaning , organising and tidying perspective. I no longer feel any guilt donating items that no longer make me happy. If you've landed on this book, chances are you are curious, but it, it's amazing."

    "I love this journal. It goes along with The Daily Stoic meditations book. I love the thought provoking prompts each day. It is well made and has plenty of space to write for each prompt each day. I highly recommend!",
    "I bought it recently and so far I love it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although it says you can start it at any time, it actually comes dated (Jan. 1st, Jan. 2nd…). I’m starting it in August so it’s inconvenient having to cross out that date and adding my own under it. It’s a small detail that I hope can be fixed for the next one.",
    "Ryan Holiday has composed a wonderful journal to help learning how to practice stoicism. If one takes the time to read and change their way of thinking, and adapt to the mindset of a stoic, the world will be a new place. Life is different, it’s meaningful-distractions from the past and present are gone. Get this books, and pick up a copy of Meditations. Watch Ryan’s YouTube and you’ll live a life that is more fulfilling.",
    "Great book, very insightful. Amazon never delivered it to me so I went to my local book store and purchased it.",
    "Good.",
    "I have written in a journal most of my life. In grade school, I called it my diary, listing my favorite things and the names of my friends and vacation spots. In high school, I wrote about my feelings (mostly who I was mad at or in love with). In college, my literature prof instructed us to keep a journal on our readings, a great way to interact with the text. After college, I wrote to try to make sense of my life: what I do, and more importantly, why I do what I do! My journal has become, in many ways, my best friend, my confidante, my therapist, my muse … my Voice.\n\nI’ve recently discovered journal prompts in online journal/blog communities, exploring a more structured and deliberate way of writing about my experiences. I've worked with these on and off for a little while now, but for some reason, nothing has really taken hold. The prompts are like \"Describe the time when you first fell in love\" or \"What is the most valuable object you've inherited?\" I mean, get it, they are meant to prompt you to just start writing with the idea that at some point, you will write about what's really important to you. But those prompts seem superficial and are often uninspiring. Because what is important to me is figuring out why I do/think/feel the way I do, how predictable those actions/thoughts/feelings are, how those actions/thoughts/feelings have changed over time, and how I should act and decide things right now and going forward.\n\nI have been reading The Daily Stoic this past year. When I got the promotional material for The Daily Stoic Journal, and checked out the sample pages, I ordered it immediately. The few questions that I read in the sample resonated, and on November 19, upon receiving my book in the mail, responded to the question: \"Will I accept the situation and still fight to do and be good?\" I created a Word document on my laptop and named it \"A Stoic Journal 2017-2018.\" I typed out the question and starting typing a response. In 20 minutes I had written just under 1000 words, describing a challenging period of my life when I felt I was being intimidated and accused of wrongdoing. I had written (complained) about this unwanted situation previously, but this prompt helped me to write about it in a focused way that made a lesson out of it for me, encouraging me to look for how I fought to do and be good in spite of being wrongfully accused. It helped me to accept what I had been through and that it actually was an opportunity to learn something new about myself and make me stronger. I have responded to the journal prompts in The Daily Stoic Journal almost every day since and it's my goal to continue throughout the year.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about yourself and the lessons that you can teach yourself through your own life experiences, I highly recommend this practice!",
    "It starts Jan 1st 🤔 do I jump to May or act like it's Jan.... 😓 Very pleased with the books quality and I've watched the author on YouTube quite a bit and like his principles and ideas. Wanted to start journaling and... Now I will be. 🙏👍",
    "I love the prompts. It compliments the daily meditations very well and is a great way to start the day! I will say, if you purchased this last year or before the paper they use is different and some writing utensils won’t take (I.e. mechanical pencil).",
    "The spaces that are meant to write in are fairly small, which is good because it's meant to be concise. That being said, I think having a notebook to go along with the journal is great so you have as much freedom to set up the page as you want. As well, you can take notes and make observations from THE DAILY STOIC in every other form (emails, the companion book, etc).\nA beautiful book with great journal prompts and philosophical insights.",
    "Very helpful. Covers so may great topics. Everyone should have it.\nTopics are assigned to a date, which is both cool but annoying if you dont start in January (because you cant start at the beginning). Would be nice to fill in your own date.",
    "A few months ago I started to use the questions posed in DSJ as prompts to act as a daily writing warm-up. Since I started using it my half-hour morning writing practice has become more interesting, experimental, surprising, and revealing. I love the philosophy of Stoicism and have found that the DSJ questions have lifted me out of my habitual (snore) philosophical loops and have managed to guide me into more fertile reflections. It makes writing practice a lot more enticing.",
    "Daily questions stimulate reflection. Book design is too cramped for my liking - larger font size, greater line spacing would support greater feeling of freedom and creativity. The paper used in the book is not great for fountain pens - too absorbent.",
    "A great way to slide into my second year of The Daily Stoic...a perfect soul mate...The Journal. The date and prompt and just enough room for considered thoughts morning and night. Yup. Clarity. Yup. Focus. Yup. More satisfying Life. Yup. All for me. Yup. Thank you Ryan Holiday for enriching my life with your practical and elegant books."

    "Let me tell you a story before I share my review of this fascinating book by Pat.\n\nIf you met me 5 years ago and told me that one day:\n\n- I will be running a million dollar company\n- I will be reading 4-5 hours a day\n- I will be spending tens and thousands of dollars on books/education\n- I will wake up at 4:30 AM sharp day in and day out\n- I will be working out every single day religiously\n\nI WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU.\n\nI would have laughed hard and long at you. But, all that changed when I first found a video from Patrick Bet-David.\n\nI had just started making some money online selling products and I was searching for something related to money on YouTube and I found one of his videos about \"becoming wealthy.\"\n\nI can still remember the video was about 10-12 minutes long and I watched it few times. Patrick ideas resonated with me and then for the next few months I watched every single video on his channel that had anything to do with making money and business.\n\nI wish I had a friend, brother, uncle or someone like Patrick in my life because my life would have taken a complete different path.\n\nThe ideas and strategies Patrick shares on his channel and in this book are things that if applied will change your life.\n\nLet me share ideas I learned from Patrick and his videos/book.\n\n1. Thinking - Learning how to think is a lost art. 99.9% of population don't know how to think, they know \"WHAT TO THINK\" but not \"HOW TO THINK\" learning how to think is one of the most important tools that every single human should learn. But we are in a period where most people would rather get shot than to learn how to think. It sounds so easy but yet its one of the hardest things. The reason being is that if your brain is cluttered with garbage how are you supposed to think of gold? This theme alone is worth the price of this book. Teaching people how to think should be a course at high schools.\n\nHow do you go about thinking? I suggest you start by reading works of David Hume/Kant/Plato to get a gist of how other great minds think and process information. The reason I suggest these three is that you will look at the world COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY afterwards in terms of how people come to conclusion on a given topic. So basically an understanding of epistemology. My life changed when I realized that.\n\n2. Decision Making - Most people make decision without giving it any thought. If you wanna be successful then learn how to make superior decisions in your life. The best way to go about decision making is to have a checklist/framework that you go through every time you have to make a decision. Pat shares one of his strategies in the book however I have found that everyone's different and you can use what works for you. One of my favorite trick is to always look at the \"CONS\" of whatever I am trying to do. Let's say I wanna buy a car I would go on Google and look for all the \"cons\" associated with that car. Because the joy of something doesnt last as long as the pain of something does. Another quick strategy is to look at the best case, ok case and worst case of your decision. The best book on decision making is Thinking Fast and Slow and a video by Charlie Munger on YouTube (The Psychology of Human Misjudgement) a must watch.\n\n3. Learn how to hire - Most people hire people that are cheap just to save money but if you wanna beat competition you gotta hire best of the best, they are the best for a reason. Imagine Patrick having in your team. He's gonna charge you a lot but one advice of Pat can change the course of your business and make you 1000x more. Learning how to hire the best is another skill that you should learn. This one is hard to learn but Pat has a video on his channel where he shares some great strategies and also in his book about building teams. Having a great team will take you to your goal 100x faster. I learned this the hard way.\n\n4. Knowing yourself - Before you know the world you gotta know yourself. I personally found the questions Pat shares in his book is one of the best to know who you are. For instance, what drives you? Is it competition or anger or to prove someone wrong? The day you know what drives you to work is the day you will make some of the biggest gains. For instance, I could never ever wake up 4:30, I tried everything but nothing worked until I watched one of Pat's video where he talked about \"motivation\" it changed my life. For most people they try to get motivated through quotes which gives you a short boost of motivation but then it wears off. To be motivated 247365 you gotta get that fire in your belly and that fire will only ignite if you have a cause. In my case it was to prove a girl that I was never ever ever ever born to be average. When I think about her then waking up at 4:30 or working days without sleep means nothing. It happens naturally. I do not need to be motivated I am motivated 24/7. I do not need anyone to tell me to read 500 pages book I just read it. This is one of the best parts of the book. Pat also has a video about this which everyone should watch. That video alone is worth millions of dollars because if you can be motivated 247365 then you will eventually get on top of Mount Everest.\n\n5. Strategy - This book's parallel to chess makes perfect sense, for instance I can help anyone become a strong chess player (given they know the basics) within 1-2 days. There is no magic to it but that in chess what happens is that beginners learn tricks/openings and spend too much time on doing tactical puzzles but the problem is that in real game of chess vs a strong chess player you are unlikely to get into a tactical position where you can play your tactical move that you learned in practice. Worst of all, you won't even know you are in a tactical position.\n\nThe remedy to all this is a simple strategy. Instead of learning openings or tactical positions what if you lure in your opponent to a specific position for which you know all the tactical ideas. This is one of the MOST PROFOUND IDEAS in chess. When you play vs a great chess player they lure you into positions that they know inside out.\n\nMagnus doesn't know 900 million different chess positions but he knows 90 positions INSIDE/OUT and he has practiced those positions for hours, day in and day out. So when he plays a game all he does is that he gets his opponent into those positions. Of course at grandmaster level this is hard because his opponents are as strong as he is but you get the idea.\n\nWhy I am telling you this?\n\nBecause in life/business it's pretty much the same thing. Instead of getting into a position that your opponent knows better try to get into a position that you know better.\n\nLet me give you few examples:\n\nLet say you are going on a date, you can just go on about it as you usually do and have a small probability of success (whatever is success to you) or you can plan a strategy ahead of time so that you get into topics/places/positions where you know what to say/what to do in order to increase your chances of getting what you want. That means from booking the exact table at a restaurant to the exact time to the exact food you will order to exact drink you will drink. For instance, in my business no matter which city I go to for meeting the first thing I do is find the restaurant where my meeting will take place and I find the people that work there and hand one of them who will be there at that hour $10-$20 and tell him/her that I will be here tonite and if they could do XYZ (whatever I want them to do to set in the position I want the conversation to start with). This works like magic for dating and meetings because in every case I start in a position where I have the upper hand to set in the mood/tone.\n\nThis strategy of getting people into a position where you have got the upper hand is something that your next five moves should be all about. This book will help you do that.\n\n6. Power Plays - If you are dealing with anything related to business and people in power then you have to understand that unless you are a born Machiavellian, you are going to face a lot of stress. You don't get on top just like that and once you are on top you don't stay on top just like that. I am not saying you have to do illegal stuff but you have to learn Power Plays. Pat shares some of his ideas and I also recommend you read 48 Laws of Power. A must read for anyone who wants to learn more about human nature. A great companion to that book would be Michael Korda's Power. Do not believe what people tell you about the game on top. The game on top is dominated by sharks, you can be a seal and get eaten or you can be a shark yourself not to bite others but to protect yourself from others.\n\nI could write forever about Patrick and his ideas and how he changed my life but that would take thousands of pages, so I recommend you get this book and learn the art of thinking ahead of competition.\n\nBy the way, I have never met Patrick but it's one of my goals to meet him one day and shake his hand and thank him for changing my life. I would never be where I am today had I not found Valuetainment on YouTube.\n\nPatrick you are a god send my friend and you are a great man on a great journey.",
    "Just a quick note: I have both the audiobook and hardcover versions and they are both very good. Patrick is a great narrator and I enjoyed his other two audiobooks, especially \"Doing The Impossible: The 25 Laws for Doing The Impossible,\" as well.\n\nThis book is an excellent book to help those are uncertain about what they want out of life, how to start a business, maintain a business, and survive in a business environment. The book emphasizes self awareness, knowing what you ultimately want out of life and a job, and after that how to structure your career path around that if you are someone that want to run a company by giving the reader 5 moves to think about. The book is well thought out and recommendations are backed by life experience, but throughout the book the reader is told to use their own judgment and not to just take the recommendations as orders. The 5 moves are broken down as follows with some highlights I picked:\n\n1. Know yourself: be self aware; know who you want to be, what you want in life. Do you want to be a CEO, intrapreneur (someone who is not necessarily a founder but a key member of building a company without being the CEO), an influencer, etc.? What drives you--job promotions, lifestyle, fame, helping others?\n\nMy favorite part of the book is actually here, right at the beginning. Patrick talks about how a heart attack his father had helped guide him to removing distractions out of his life and to focus on bettering his life and his family's life. Although based on the \"Know yourself and what drives you\" theme, it is obvious we all have a desire to have a nice life, and we all will have different definitions for what that may be. It is important to realize we have competing desires with our one for a better life, no matter how seemingly innocent they may be, and that we need to remove these competing desires as barriers to do the work and make the sacrifices necessary to fulfill our desire for a better life.\n\n2. Ability to reason: the book speaks about great processors of information and gives 8 traits for them, but the first two are the ones that I find most important--ask lots of questions and don't care about being right or wrong initially, just in reaching the truth. I appreciate the frankness here because many people, not all, try to act like they know everything and have to be correct, both in business and in life, and they end up hurting their relationships and prospects of success do this. If those people would focus on improving and not worrying about how not knowing everything appears to others they would succeed more.\n\n3. Building the right team: understand your teams desires; talks about firing people, which as someone who may not be a CEO but has worked with coworkers who should have been fired, I am glad he does not shy away from doing what is necessary for the good of the team; communicate expectations--you'd be surprised how many people/bosses do not do this and act angry when something is not completed at the time or in the fashion of their desire. By communicating expectations, the level of urgency and detail required for the task is conveyed and the employee knows exactly how to prioritize their work--for some bosses I've had, if they said to do something in an open ended fashion, they wanted progress to be done on it, but for the day to day tasks to take priority; others wanted it done and handed over to them with a quick turn around regardless of other tasks. People are not mind readers and clear communication can help avoid unnecessary friction.\n\n4. Strategy to scale--raising capital; accountability; building systems for measurement and making things systematic to easily train the next wave of talent. My favorite parts were the respect shown for predictive analytics and recommendation of codifying your business methods to more easily train the next wave of talent in your company. If more company's took this approach, they'd save tons of time and grief (I have been on the receiving end of the grief due to poor training).\n\n5. Power plays: beat the dominant entities of your industry and control your narrative and brand. This one has quite a few points to get into, but one thing I will like to point out is the point of not prostituting your brand. Patrick lives this. He does not talk about the company he runs, PHP, much on his Valutainment YouTube channel. He uses it when he draws on his life experiences, yes, but he does not promote it. This built my trust in him and I will vouch that he seems like an honest person that knows how to respect his viewers/readers/customers time and will not jerk them around.\n\nHe will make mention in the book to use your own judgement and not necessarily just go by what he says. He does not try to come across as a know it all, but as someone who has gone through many different situations, learned many things, come up with strategies for putting a situation in his favor, and being highly curious and willing to evolve and change his thinking. If you are looking for guidance on figuring out how you be self aware, aware of coworkers/employees desires, how to build a company, maintain it, and grow it, this will be a solid and perhaps even indispensable source of knowledge for you.",
    "Your next five moves is remarkably well-written with incredible strategies and actionable tactics. The mesmerising stories Bet-David shared in the book illustrate his powerful points eloquently. Bet-David shared amateur mistakes he made when he wasn't thinking more than one or two moves ahead. This led to frustration and quitting his job early in his career. Chapter 1 starts with the most important move: who do you want to be? Most people do not know who they are and have not reflected on who they want to be. The personal identity audit is a thought provoking exercise that provides insights about things you may not have asked yourself before. Living in complete alignment with who you are is fundamental. It's great to see the references of books that have heavily influenced the author on his journey. Blue Ocean Strategy being one of them. Bet-David shows the power of cultivating a strong mindset and setting a clear vision with future truths. This book is a real gem for anyone who is committed to reach their full potential.",
    "I listened the audio book before I got the hard copy, read that one too.\n\nPatrick, the wisdom, advices, mistakes you have done, your progress in this book is gold.\nYou must study this book, not only read it.\n\nI recommend it to all my friends that are interested in growing, and I recommend to whom is reading this review.\n\nThe price you pay for this book, you can borrow that from your kids 😁, it’s not even close to what it should cost.\n\nThank you Patrick Bet-David. 🙏",
    "The book is written in very simple and effective way.\nLemme give you a warning: you're going to get emotional in the first chapter. Book has way way way more value than I anticipated there would be. I'm fired up!\nBook is incredible and Very diverse. Author touched on almost every important element.\nFor me This book is a missing peice of a Puzzle. You know how you read multiple books and there are some things that no author wants to talk about, those little details, those joints that connect things, those missing puzzle pieces.\nBook teaches you multiple things starting for looking inwards to how to be the best leader, how to controll the narrative, how to create systems and much much more.\nI gained a lot of knowledge and truely thankful for the author (PBD) to put in the time and effort.\nThe amount we pay is nothing for the knowledge you provide.",
    "It's a book that you can come back and read it again and again.\n\nI am Sai Prahlad K, Entrepreneur, International FIDE Rated Chess Player, and Coach to over 300+ Kids and adults. I have gifted this book to my core team, top performers at our academy, and to my important circles.\n\nI read the book cover to cover in under 16 hours. Writing this review after my first read.\n\nThe book will give you clarity and understanding, it delivers what is promised. But what you gather will depend on where you are at in life. Some of the later portions of the book you can understand it, but won't feel it till you experience them. Hence I recommend multiple reads or pondering, Dyana (meditation).\n\nPatrick has written in such a way that it's not boastful or egotistic but takes the point across to the reader.\n\nThe book is full of examples from Patrick's own life and many others. In this sense, it makes it kinda like an autobiography as well.\n\nI personally loved all of those areas, especially those were destiny was guiding Patrick. Example Edwin backstab, his dad's heart attack, Dotty, Personality audit, Cathy Larson on approach, Shut down by Katty on his ideas, Ray Apparel investment, The big competitor suing Patrick on day one, and few others. if you read the book you will understand these are key events that happened in Patrick's life. Though it wasn't beneficial in hindsight, on the deeper level it was destiny guiding him to where he is today.\n\nThe book also has many tools and techniques that you can use when facing challenges, as well as what not to do in business and life. It's riddled with golden nuggets and tactical steps. For hiring, firing, approaching investors, bootstrap, knowing people's mindsets, due diligence, steps to overcome problems, creating a comp-plan, building a team, understanding oneself. Hence, requires more than one read, and to be on your arsenal when facing challenges.\n\nIt's a no brainer, must have read, more so if you are an entrepreneur or someone who wants to succeed in life. The best thing money can buy!\n\nI would also recommend gifting this book to people above your circle. People in power appreciate books.\n\nMy favorite part is the example of IBM founder's vision, plan, and execution. Patrick did a video on this on Youtube (check it out). I took that example that was on the book and changed from' Building a Great Company' to 'World Champion' and taught to my kids (students). it was a very powerful message. You should do it too. Use the book to teach.\n\nThanks, Patrick for creating this amazing book. I would love to read your next book which may come in a few years/decades. Can't wait!\n\nIf you are free would love to play a game of chess with you, show you how I combine chess, business and life.\n\nCheers,\nSai Prahlad K\nfrom India",
    "Patrick Bet-David (PBD) is an American business owner who is the host of the Youtube! channel Valuetainment with over, to-date, 2.9M subscribers. PBD went from Iran to founding his own financial services firm PHP and has become a leading Youtube! personality with a number of compelling video interviews with the likes of Ray Dalio, Kevin Hart and the late Kobe Bryant.\n\nHis 2020 hardcover book “Your Five Next Moves: Master the Art of Business Strategy” is about 280 pages and covers the idea that a majority of today’s most successful business leaders and organisations are successful because of their ability to look ahead, to see what is in front of them, to see the plays coming up and behind able to react, to out-strategise or out-think the competition where it counts.\n\nLike the game Chess, PBD argues, the top players in the field of business and use clarity, strategy, tactics, insight, experience to frame the opportunity, risk, investment and payoff; mixing foresight and hindsight, data, analytics and ideas into strategic plays.\n\nTold through a prism of stories, Your Next Five Moves, frames the five moves through PBD’s personal storytelling of his personal journey with success, failures and what he learnt from it and links it to one of the five moves.\n\nAs such, the book is part-auto biography, part-business thinking and part-advocacy, and frames ideas of introspection, goal setting, the ability of removing emotion when approaching difficult conversations and using strategy to position outcomes to your favour through negotiation and offering something in return.\n\nFrom the outset, the book starts from the position you must get clarity of who you are, where you are at, where you want to be, who you want to be, and what are you willing to do to get there. Introspective activities include a Personality Audit, and a challenge to use the Five Whys to keep asking why until a purpose is revealed.\n\nPost introspective ideas, later chapters talk about the reasoning and sense making when making decisions, one of the ideas PBD offers is that of an Investment Time Return (ITR) formula that he encourages his team to embrace in every deal, or opportunity.\n\nPBD also offers the idea that in meetings, using stoic thoughts or analysing what is being said all be parts of the plays one makes to ensure high emotion can be avoided.\n\nOne tool PBD advocates using when making strategic decisional making is a Solve for X worksheet (which is included in the book) where he advocates his employees and himself to use to evaluate the real underpinning cause, and align this with urgency, people needed, the available solutions, to list possible negative outcomes and what new protocols can be birthed.\n\nIn move 3, PBD reiterates the idea you can’t get to the top of the mountain by yourself. You’re going to need a team, and the more strategic thinker will ask what the make-up of the team will be, how do you attract and keep talent beyond simple financial compensation models.\n\nIn move 4, PBD mentions that if you want to be strategic – you need to think long term, that your business needs to work without you, that to move from the solo-business to the micro to the macro business you’re going to need to scale. Although the materials of scaling aren’t included, it would seem that PBD links team, processes, internal and external competitiveness, branding and marketing together to create a golden thread of what scaling actually means.\n\nFinally in move 5, PBD outlines a list of strategic power plays that may help when things aren’t going well, and conversely; what to do when things are going well\n\nOne of the things that comes across from the book is PBD’s competitiveness, and imposing a demanding approach to his team to be as competitive as himself, with processes, systems, discussion and techniques to ask his team not only to move quicker, but ask how to get better.\n\nWhether it’s forcing his employees to read books, write reports; or if its asking his team to be analytical – its clear that continuous improvement, process and being competitive is very important to PBD; whether its replicable I’m not sure.\n\nThe book is well written, is throughly from a storytelling perspective. If you’re expecting the book to be technical, I’m sorry to disappoint you. The book is not a tactical playbook chock full of strategic plays that one can play; I think this is a bit of a shame, considering how the book was marketing and how PBD framed it. I recall in his videos PBD would state how it took him over 2 years to write the book, and how over 100+ strategic business books have influenced his thinking. Given this, one might expect a consolidation or curation of what these business books have taught him and how they reflect against the five moves he advocates. However, this does not occur.\n\nConcretely, the book offers a few worksheets and a website with resources and other books to read. It offers ideas that perhaps you can use to help frame your current situation and see how it might apply. However, the book given its position from a storytelling perspective is not a book about corporate level strategy, or how a micro business might use the same plays to be competitive. In this regard, the level of strategy offered is surface level, personal level; and this is fine.\n\nFrom a critique point of view, the book sometimes conflates situational awareness with strategy. Perhaps this is intentional. Many times the examples given are just situational awareness, how to develop it, how to react to it, how to predict it. In this way, I think its fine to do this. But just don’t expect book-smart, corporate level strategy. It doesn’t consider how Porter’s Five Forces actually works in the real world. It doesn’t look at how McKinsey or other big-name c-suite consultants use strategy (which I think is a shame), and it doesn’t say – “this is how they do it, but this is how we do it in the real world, and this is what you should learn from it”.\n\nOne of the formula’s given is the ITR (Investment, Time and Return) formula. There is tendency that PBD has to frame everything from a transactional point of view. And I’m not 100% convinced that every decision that a business makes is transactional, or has a capitalist foundation. Despite this critique, I feel such forumlas are timely, useful reminders to readers that business owners must not only be situationally aware of the offer, but also the payoff. Despite its pull, a business case may not be the only qualifier of whether a decision is a worthwhile one to pursuit.\n\nGiven all of this, I think the book is very good; well written and has some good reasonable ideas in it that can be re-read and can help re-iterate that the difference between a solo business, micro business, macro business and big name business is processes, systems, methods, strategy, the ability to be humble, to learn.\n\nThe book is about the interplay between situational awareness, business strategy and you. From introspection to strategy, the book offers personal storytelling as a frame for discussion of what strategy is a personal perspective; and offers insights on the moves that one should think about.\n\nI would say its a worthwhile read and would recommend reading it. Just don’t expect a corporate level critique of book academic strategy and real-world strategy.\n\nOverall: 7/10"

    "Thinking in systems is analogous to ‘zooming out’ and looking at something from a broader perspective. Whether you are examining the functions of a social body, a corporate body, a governmental body, or a human body, the processes are generally the same. Each system has an intended goal (strengthening community bonds, monetary growth, keeping the body alive) and it has different processes for how it achieves this goal.\n\nAll systems have a ‘stock’ which is the foundation of what the system uses to achieve its goal. Stocks are things like “the water in a bathtub, a population, the books in a bookstore, the wood in a tree, the money in a bank, your own self-confidence,” which are subject to the flows of the system. “Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures.” Stock is what you have at any one moment in time and the flow is how it changes.\n\nLet’s take the human body as an example. The body’s stock is comprised of its organs, bones, muscles, tissues, and all the things on the inside that keep it running. The body’s flow is the intake of food and water, which the system translates into energy, and the output of this energy as human waste. The goal of this system is to keep the body alive.\n\nWhen systems get tricky is when the reported goal of a system is different from the results it tangibly achieves. For example, what is the ostensible goal of a business? Most business owners would tell you their goal is to deliver customer satisfaction in the form of whatever it is they make and sell, whether it be haircuts or hot meals. This is true for local businesses, but larger businesses are more honest when they admit their company goal is to make a profit. In reality, the true goal of most businesses in a capitalistic system is “to grow, to increase market share, [and] to bring the world (customers, suppliers, regulators) more and more under the control of the corporation.” Ask yourself this: Does McDonald’s pride itself more on its delicious hamburgers or its worldwide recognition?\n\nA system that I have been considering lately is our doctoral system here in the United States. Many doctors work 70-80 hour weeks with overnight hours which means a rotating sleep schedule and off-beat eating habits. The fastest you can reasonably become a doctor is after passing 4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical school, and then completing a 5 year residency. If you graduate high school at age 18, you are finishing your residency at age 31 (probably with hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loans). These are tough conditions and high standards. Our society’s system for training and managing doctors has developed alongside the growth of society for hundreds of years, which means that all of these mechanisms were developed for good purposes. For one thing, there is simply so much more that we know about medicine and the human body that must be learned. It still remains that a major symptom of this system is overtired doctors and we need to adjust the flow and help them out. Alternatively, consider the system surrounding the careers of professors. Tenure was implemented in order to gives teachers academic freedom, which is a good thing. One of its symptoms, however, is that the process of achieving tenure has become ultra competitive.\n\nWhat happens when a country’s goals are poorly defined? Here in the United States, and in many western countries, we measure our economic goals by our level of GNP (gross national product), which is the value of the final goods and services produced by the economy. This number, however, says nothing about our health, happiness, beauty, strength, intelligence or integrity. Our GNP rises if there are more car accidents and medical bills. Defining business and economics in this way has cost humanity in many major ways including environmental degradation, monopolization of markets by huge corporations, and the suction of wealth from the lower classes to the higher.\n\nAll of this analysis leads us to the inevitable question: how do we change a system? The first thing to define is which system we wish to investigate and alter. This is important because there are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. “Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion—the questions we want to ask.” If your house is too cold, then you must examine the insulation and the thermostat. If your body is sick, you must examine the fuel you are putting into it and the people you allow around it. If your country is broken, that too must be examined. Is it the social system, the environmental system, or the governmental system? Is it the financial system, the educational system, or the welfare system? The reality, of course, is that problems lie within each of these systems independently and also as a whole. There are no easy answers here, the difficultly lying in the fact that the farther one zooms out, the more overlapped all of these systems become. To change one requires the agreement and movement of masses of people in one unified direction. But what if fixing one environmental problem causes a cultural one? Or vice versa? The complexities are never-ending.\n\nIf you zoom all the way out, you can see that all of us are connected across time and space. “Actions taken now [will] have some immediate effects and some that radiate out for decades to come. We experience now the consequences of actions set in motion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago.” Many of the systems we inhabit today are like rivers that we were thrown mercilessly into. They were already running, predetermined by forces and people who came long before us, and while it is our job to stay afloat while we are on the water, and to improve upon them as best we can, they will continue to run long after we are gone.",
    "I highly recommend this book regarding Systems Theory for those learning about the discipline. Though I'm new to the field of Systems Theory, this is my 4th read on the topic. The previous books were entry-level and helpful. The authors add another layer of instructions, insights, and meaningful examples and case studies.",
    "I work with implied systems all the time in software engineering, and I wish I ahead read this sooner. Not so much because these concepts are new, but more in that they are packaged and described so elegantly. I feel like I have a better vocabulary for discussing these concepts.",
    "There are a few books that encapsulate a way of thinking so simply, so clearly and so compellingly that I find myself giving little kisses of delight to the cover. I read this on a Kindle, so this resulted in quite a lot of smudging.\nI am not a student of systems or someone who ever spent much time thinking about systems at all, although, like practically everybody, my life and work are all about either creating, maintaining, supporting, or surviving various systems. I heard about this book from a Tweet referring to its twenty-fifth anniversary and linking to an article singing its praises, which it does better than I can. For me, it has been a truly revelatory experience, a platonic slave-in-the-cave moment, which I believe will divide my cognitive experience into pre and post its reading. As Meadows warns at its outset, studying systems leads one to see systems everywhere, which, of course, is because they were there all along. But being able to see and interpret them allows us to better participate and avoid traps that commonly lead to system failure. Sadly, it also allows us to understand why some decisions taken by executives, politicians, and others that manage systems in which we have little or no control are doomed to failure and to undermine their own goals. This awareness will help readers become better citizens/coworkers and critics of leadership. But it can also help us avoid issues that threaten our own, smaller systems, our relationships, families, homes, work, and health.\nThis book draws heavily on examples from the time in which it was written, which artificially sets the book in a particular historical moment. Meadows simply had so many examples to chose from, that she took quotes from contemporaneous newspaper articles. But the examples might as well be chosen from today’s stories or those from hundreds of years ago. They are just examples. This book is timeless. These quotes from the early nineties have the added benefit of proving her point, as in most cases history has borne out the predictions that stem from the flaws and features that Meadows points out.\nNote that there were some oddities in the Kindle version. A few words seem to have disappeared in various places in the transposition. I bought a hard copy of the book and was able to fill the gaps (just a few words here and there, nothing that would keep me from recommending the Kindle edition). I hope the editors will correct this.\nThe end of the book contains a very useful appendix that I am tempted to tear out and put up on the wall, detailing fundamentals of systems thinking.\nI could not recommend this highly enough.",
    "I was expecting way too much from the book. Most likely due to the fact that I’m thinking in systems already I found the book quite boring to read through. Examples are too extensive and I personally think that you don’t have to spend 5 pages on the same example of thermostat influencing room’s temperature. And there are many examples like this…\n\nOn the other hand if you never ever heard about systems around you or never thought about it, it might be a very good read.\n\nI have taken some notes from it and will try to use some of the tips and tricks in a real life situation. But will I use the book as constant reference once I face some problems - nope.",
    "This is a great book, laid out in very understandable terms for newcomers to systems thinking. It really is a new way of look at the world and can even increase your level of consciousness through getting you to view the bigger picture in all walks of life. You'll be less judgemental and have a much broader scope with your thinking. I would have loved to have seen more amusing examples of systems throughout, like one explaining the quantity of semen in a porn actors testicles, instead of ones about car dealerships and thermostat systems, as they're a little dry and dull, but I guess this book needs to appeal to business people.",
    "I had always considered myself to be a system thinker and had read many books on artificial life, chaos theory etc.\n\nBut until now there was no book that I had read that formed a basis of how systems, in general, tied together. This book provides that glue. It covers a lot of ground and provides solid examples of how system thinking can, quite literally, change the world. It covers areas such as oil production, politics, user of language and drug addiction in ways that are cohesive and informative. It never provides 'just so stories' that are unsupported and provide examples of simple systems (from the systems zoo) that explain why often those who influence systems end up pushing the wrong way and making things worse, even though they may have the best of intentions.\n\nI have so far recommended this book to five people all from different backgrounds and will be folding in what I have learnt here into my User Experience work.",
    "A primer to systems thinking indeed! I gave this book 5 stars not just because the contents are incredibly useful, but also because it reads as smoothly as any well written novel. If you are interested in how the world works then you are in the right place. But beware, unlike many others, this book offers no easy solutions. Yet in its description of complexity, its admission of \"it's effing difficult\", its many examples of how easy it is to get it wrong when trying to solve big, complex problems one does not find a sense of despair and futility of effort, no, one finds a sense of empowerment in understanding how \"everything relates to everything\" which is why it is so so difficult to design workable solutions without the systems view of the problem. Mrs Meadows also does another thing: she manages our expectations. Even with the right tools and a hope that we indeed can successfully intervene in big, complex problems she makes it clear that it won't be easy, it won't take only a few weeks, we might not get it right the first three times and we might even make it worse before we improve anything. It's okay though, because that is how it works. Moving forward is a slow and difficult process, but thanks to Mrs Meadows we might be at least slightly confident that our effort is in the right direction. Go read it.",
    "I recommend Thinking in Systems because it has changed the way I understand and relate to my world. Published after Donella Meadow's death, it introduces Systems Thinking by way of definition, illustration and application.\n\nIn Part 1, System Structure and Behaviour, Meadows uses two graphical tools to analyse systems: stock and flow diagrams to show system structure; and charts mapping stock or flow levels over time to explore system behaviour for specific scenarios. The diagrams can be used to display \"balancing\" (aka \"negative\") and \"reinforcing\" (aka \"positive\") feedback loops, and the charts to explore how these might play out.\n\nWhile some of the systems might seem simplistic, they build up understanding of a key Systems Thinking insight, that systems generate their own behaviour. And if you're ever wondered why the \"heroes and villains\" style of explanation only works in retrospect, this is a damn good explanation.\n\nChapter two, The Zoo, is a library of common system structures and their behaviour. Those of us from the software world will be reminded of a patterns library. Again, these patterns illustrate a deeper insight, that \"systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if the outward appearance of these systems is completely dissimilar.\" (p 51)\n\nIn Part 2, Systems and Us, Meadows applies Systems Thinking to our world. Many of the examples are dated, but I found myself thinking how applicable these patterns and insights were to topics I was currently encountering - for example, I can't help thinking she would have loved the way that Kanban reflects a systems learning, that the ability of people and organisations to execute tasks degrades rapidly as the number of tasks rises beyond a critical limit.\n\nOf course one natural and urgent interest in systems behaviour is how to change it. If worshipping heroes and lynching villains isn't going to reform systems that may exhibit non-linear, perverse or self-preserving behaviour, what is?\n\nIn Part 3, Creating Change in System and in our Philosophy, Meadows gives us a dozen leverage points for changing systems, starting with the simplest and ending with the most powerful. She finishes with a list of \"systems wisdoms\" - attitudes and values that she and others she respects have adopted to make them more effective at understanding and changing the systems we live in.\n\nLike many of the other reviewers, I wish I'd read this book a long time ago. It has its limitations - I'd love to see more recent examples, and can't help wondering if there are any open-source Systems modelling resources. But for me this is a book of timeless value for anyone interested in a better understanding of their world and their options in it.",
    "Wow - I heard this book was good, but its been \"unputdownable\"..\nFrom the perennial problem of managing drug addiction, to climate change and population growth - you name it - you will get an amazing, easy to follow, perspective on the \"zoo\" of different system types and the systems issues that follows..\nIt helps you see more clerkly why praising/blaming individuals is so problematic and it also explains the \"Groundhog Day\" of things not getting fixed, even getting worse.. Its necessary for anyone who is really serious in effecting change in the issues of today"

    "This book will give you great knowledge on your approach to selling! Stop chasing and start helping people get what they want.",
    "I love how the book is broken into small chapters. This makes for a quick daily read of a concept to ensure you stay focused on the right things (ninja) each day.",
    "Best book I have ever read on sales, the art of sales, and a foolproof system to increase sales. I have read and been coached by Tom Ferry and Greg Luther, neither seemed right for me. Ninja Selling rang true to me and how I view the world. I started implementing some of the systems immediately and when time and money allowed I attended the Ninja Selling Installation. Between the two, I am better at my craft, provide better service for my clients while creating better value for them overall. I highly recommend this book for anyone in sales, regardless of their product.",
    "Full disclosure, I am a Ninja Selling Instructor. But, perhaps the question is, why? In 2008, I had the honor of meeting Larry Kendal. At that time I was already a seasoned trainer an had practiced real estate successfully in my career. That said, there was something appealing, pragmatic and unique about Ninja Selling, and its founder Larry Kendall.\n\nSo, after watching Larry present on the system, I was hooked. I wanted to teach it too.\n\nLong story short, I started teaching the system at top brokerages and got extraordinary results. Not just for me, but for so many I was privileged to teach.\n\nThere’s something about this system that just attracts like minded, authentic people who also want to perform well, earn a great living and live an extraordinary life.\n\nI’ve can tell you stories about agents who had less then $2500 in closings is February, took the coirsa and applied it full on and made $112,000 in that same year (rookie)\n\nOr, about an agent who earned $60,000 a year for four straight years and after taking Ninja, doubled the next year to $125k, 240k the year after that and was at $400k three years after the course.\n\nAnd here’s the best part. The book delivers. It’s not a preview or a teaser. It has substance and answers and really helps people not only understand the system, but apply it as well.\n\nAs noted, I am privileged to teach this system, and have done so since about 2008. But so far I have read this book 3 times since I had it and I still find myself seeing and learning about this game changing system.\n\nDecide for yourself. Get the book, and see for yourself. TSW. This Stuff Works. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.",
    "Larry provides a very practical, helpful, scaleable strategy that works for a variety of applications, real estate and otherwise. I highly recommend this excellent book!",
    "I didn't want it to end.",
    "Great book came neatly packed",
    "Came in good condition and great read!",
    "This suppose to be a used badly rating copy , certainly not very good or even good. The ratings of book from World Of Books online store is much accurate. The book was gift for wife but it had so much hand written notes in first half of the book from permanent ink that its a complete waste of money. I would appreciate it can be replaced.",
    "I'm a realtor and also a raving fan of Lou Tice. So I was excited to see he is an inspiration for this book. Can't wait to get right into the book. I also ordered it on audio, so I can reinforce the concepts when I'm in the car. My son is in car sales and I can't wait to share it with him when I'm done.",
    "This book is an awesome read, but it arrived in poor condition...if it had been a gift, I would have returned it, Dust jacket was covered in sticky stuff...not sure what.",
    "For those who know... Ninja Selling is the book to have in your library.",
    "It is more of how you organize yourself of being a top Realtor. Few selling techniques but less or not evident at all in other markets."

    "Incredible insight on not only how to lead, but excellent examples on what happens when we stray from our visions.\n\nAny leader, mentor or member of management should be encouraged to read this book.",
    "I enjoyed very much the positive and inspiring ideas of the book delivered through real life examples. Powerful reading I recommend",
    "The author has a smooth writing style. It's a very enjoyable read with all the relevant references.",
    "This will be one of those books that I read and then let it go to work in challenging my current views of life. It started off easy, then as some of my own finite thinking became apparent it got uncomfortable. At some point I was toying with the idea of putting it down.\n\nNow that I've read it cover-to-cover I can look back at my own journey through the book and I realized that the book is just a primer for the lifelong journey. A just cause for me is to try to leave everyone and everything I touch in a better position. To live with purpose from passion and make a difference every day.\n\nIf you are willing to examine your own life and step back to see the big picture then this book is for you.\n\nThank you to the courageous leaders who stood up and stood out and continue to do so for so long as they are in the game. As you so rightly said Simon: this book is the result of the a bunch of people who had the courage to live out experimentally what they knew in their gut to be a better way.\n\nPs. Theodore may just have been right about The man in the arena....",
    "Sinek hits it out of the park again. He encourages leaders to think and act differently from the world around us. I don’t think he’s a Christian, but Jesus’ way of leading change sounds similar to his.\n\nFor the less important stuff, the book could be shorter. It’d be a great Ted talk.",
    "This is the third of three Simon Sinek books that I have read. I must say that \"Start With Why\" is still my favorite, but \"The Infinite Game\" comes in a strong recond. Sinek did a great job rebounding from his previous book, \"Leaders Eat Last,\" which wasn't bad, but didn't articulate anything I didn't already know. This book, however, addressed the core of what I see a lot of organizations and companies struggling with, which is a long-term vision. We are so wired to only see until the next quarterly earnings report, hoping to make a quick buck that we forget about the long-term longevity of the company.\nSinek did a great job showing that those leaders who play the finite game instead of the infinite game display significant weaknesses, which becomes a detriment to their vision and, ultimately, the success of the organizations/businesses they lead. I also particularly appreciated the author's elaboration on the dangers of high performance-low trust leaders/employees. The status quo is so focused on this type of mindset, and it explains why so many people are unhappy with their workplace climate. The high performance-low trust people are the ones that will stab you in the back and take anyone down to get to the top. Our society seems to be breeding more of this type of performer, and that is very concerning.\nI also appreciate the author explaining how money and focusing too much on the product should not be the primary focus because when it is, a majority of the workforce suffers. Indeed, generating revenue is important since that is what keeps the organization alive. Still, too much emphasis on profit brings the vision down to the finite level instead of the infinite. The author highlights companies such as Patagonia and CVS who have lead from the infinite mindset and have seen tremendous success despite criticism.\nWhat I do see resonating through all three of Sinek's books thus far is a specific success formula for businesses to succeed. That is, take care of your employees, who will take care of the customers, who will then take care of the shareholders. There is a lot of pure truth to that.",
    "In this book, noted author and inspirational speaker Simon Sinek argues that, much like in life, in business it is crucial organizations take an \"infinite\" approach to strategy and related business decisions instead of chasing metric improvement through greater income, higher stock prices, or similar measurements of \"success.\" While these and other metrics are important, Simon's message is really about businesses and organizations crafting more of a missionary vision which will help drive their business decisions to a greater degree than often short-term, transitory metrics. With a sufficiently well-designed vision and business model to support it, Simon further argues that putting people first completes doing business with an infinite mindset. Although several great examples were used in this book, the classic Apple versus IBM or, later, IBM versus the PC competition was used to show how an infinite vision can play out in real life.\n\nUnfortunately, while I liked the high value Simon placed on a business vision and putting people first, his description of an infinite mindset in this book often applies more to individuals than companies. While there are some companies who do last for decades if not centuries, this is not the norm. Would the marketplace of work and consumer demand be better off if the longevity that once marked great companies returned? I think it is a fascinating question the author really does not explore. Without extending his book to really look at this key question that underlies his basic argument, Simon could have reworked a lot of the advice in this book to apply to individuals in whatever their role - from a lowly cashier all the way up to a chief executive officer. Unfortunately, this book does seem to cater more to the c-suite leadership I'm sure Mr. Sinek has made his career advising. While I like this book and do recommend it to anyone in management or working in a corporate staff environment, its underlying argument does need to be clarified and the book's audience expanded for it to truly have a significant effect on how companies do business.",
    "Great poits of view. Should be mandatory ready",
    "I am utterly disappointed with this book. I find Simon uplifting and inspiring, but apart from the message \"Start with why\" i don't think he has much more to say. Maybe because i've been following him since his Ted talk, i notice how little knowledge since he bestowed on us.\nThe whole book is full of stories explaining the finite vs infinite mind. I got the gist, Simon, i think after 2 stories i can tell what that means. Sadly it's disappointment. I don't know what i was hoping to read but repetitive stories without much substance in them is not what i was expecting from him.",
    "The Infinite Game is an excellent book, I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my co-founder, Adam Gray. If you are in Leadership, Marketing or sales it is certainly a book to read.\n\nThe book describes the difference between Finite and Infinite mindsets (different from growth and fixed mindsets) and provides a framework for companies to recognise which mindset they have and how to implement an Infinite Mindset.\n\nIn Finite games, the rules are fixed and the end point is clear. “We are going to be a market leader or we are going to change the world”.\n\nIn Infinite games, the players come and go, the rules are changeable and there is no defined end point. People with an infinite mindset build stronger, more inventive, more inspiring organisations.\n\nIf you are in any role in leadership, culture creation, vision creating or marketing in either the start-up or in fact a business of any size, you should read this book.",
    "There is little commend this text. Simon ,the arch marketeer in sheep's clothing,has built his career with books based upon an opinionated why statement, pandering dreamily to the ways of the American army and now “ the difficult 3rd album” an idealistic rant about a more sustainable business environment and caring capitalism. If you like your leadership books fluffy and without substance then this is for you. If not , save your hard earned cash for a soapbox for Simon to tell us about his next and hopefully final book.",
    "Simon is very uplifling on his videos and possibly that's what he should be doing instead of writing. The book is a collection of stories of how different companies apply principles of either finite or infinite games. The story can be as short as: The CEO stated something in his annual speech that implied he's into finite games and then company started having problems.\n\nThere is no analysis, no deeper insight. In the form as it is now I doubt it can be really useful to anybody, but perhaps I'm wrong as the booknseems to have great reviews.",
    "I like Sinek's writing a lot, and believe his core message in relation to successful businesses emphasising the human is an important point. And in the Infinite Game he adds another layer to this by suggesting that great organisations aim towards an unachievable but critical 'Just Cause', thus playing an 'infinite game'. In that they sacrifice the easy short term solutions (papering over the cracks) for the seemingly risky at the time (leap of faith) but necessary in the long term solutions.\n\nHowever, if you've read both Start with Why and Leaders Eat Last you will see that this book is an incremental step forward instead of a massive leap of focus. His returns to similar anecdotes that have occurred in previous works, most notably the Microsoft vs. Apple Executive story in relation to the iPod vs the Zune.\n\nAlthough the chapter on existential flexibility and his writing around Walt Disney's life is fascinating and some of his best work to date.\n\nTLDR: If you've read Start with Why and Leaders Eat Last it's good but not essential reading. If you haven't it's great book and definitely worth reading."

    "Hans Rosling is a phenomenal human being. He’s a Swedish physician and epidemiologist whom had worked in many poorest villages in the world - like in Mozambique, Zaire, and Tanzania - had taught and gave speeches in many more places around the world from his native Sweden to India to Canada to Iran to Vietnam, and also had worked with many UN agencies, influencing global elites from Melinda Gates, to Mark Zuckeberg, to Al Gore, to Fidel Castro, and the many Davos crowds along the way.\n\nHe is one of the most qualified persons to teach about global health, and perhaps one of few people who have the right to be pessimistic about the world, considering what he had witnessed and experienced directly in the world. But yet, his life's work and mission is the total opposite of that. In a world where the majority of news headlines are giving us the impression that the state of the world is getting worse by the day, Rosling appears with the counter perception with undisputed arguments: through data and charts.\n\nThis book is the culmination of this mission. With a kind and worldly professor vibe, which is reflected in the relaxed tone of his writing (and the fun fact that he's a proud sword swallower), he breaks down the paragraphs into bite size sub-chapters that makes the book easy to digest. And then with every argument he makes, he backs it up with the statistics and the charts that comes with it. And oh how he loves his charts. He has every imaginable charts there is in the world, from life expectancy, immunization, to plane crash deaths, legal slavery, to guitar per capita, new movies, even the projection of his grandson’s height.\n\nMoreover, Rosling created 4 income levels to make it easier to analyse the condition of countries over the world, with Level 1 to Level 4 progress. Level 1 is extreme poverty: $1 per day (roughly 1 billion people live like this today). Level 2: $4 a day (roughly 3 billion people live like this today). Level 3: $16 per day (roughly 2 billion people live like this today). Level 4: more than $64 a day (roughly 1 billion people live like this today).\n\nSo, the state of the world is not getting worse, in fact if we look at the many charts in the book it is strikingly obvious that we've never had it better than today. For example, contrary to popular belief the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved in the past 20 years. In the year 1800 around 85% of humanity lived on Level 1, but just 20 years ago it was down to 29%, while today it is 9%. Global life expectancy has also grown from an average age of 30 years old in 1800, to 60 years in 1973, to 72 years as at the writing of the book in 2016-2017. Even the label developing and developed countries are technically wrong, since today 75% of people live in middle-income countries, or between Level 2 and Level 3. “Not poor, not rich, but somewhere in the middle and starting to live a reasonable life.”\n\nRosling then teaches us how to read the data more closely. For example, we can measure the \"temperature\" of a society from the child mortality rate, because children are very fragile and there are so many things that can kill them. He reasoned, \"[w]hen only 14 children die out of 1000 in Malaysia, this means that the other 986 survive. Their parents and their society manage to protect them from all the dangers that could have killed them: germs, starvation, violence, and so on. So this number 14 tells us that most families in Malaysia have enough food, their sewage systems don’t leak into their drinking water, they have good access to primary health care, and mothers can read and write. It doesn’t just tell us about the health of children. It measures the quality of the whole society.\"\n\nMoreover, in a Daniel Kahneman-esque approach, Rosling also challenges our cognitive biases on seeing the world with such negative judgements. He explained \"[i]n large part, it is because of our negativity instinct: our instinct to notice the bad more than the good. There are three things going on here: the misremembering of the past; selective reporting by journalists and activists; and the feeling that as long as things are bad it’s heartless to say they are getting better.\"\n\nParticularly on addressing the role of the media on selective reporting, he made a good point on the unavailability of breaking news in the past: \"When Europeans slaughtered indigenous peoples across America a few centuries ago, it didn’t make the news back in the old world. When central planning resulted in mass famine in rural China, millions starved to death while the youngsters in Europe waving communist red flags knew nothing about it. When in the past whole species or ecosystems were destroyed, no one realized or even cared. Alongside all the other improvements, our surveillance of suffering has improved tremendously. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite.\"\n\nAnd of course there's the common adage that bad news sell more than good news. For instance, the media report on plane crashes, that made some people afraid of flying. In 2016 a total of 40 million commercial passenger flights landed safely at their destinations, with 10 ended in fatal accidents. But of course, the 10 that didn't make it were the ones the media wrote about, the 0.000025% of the total.\n\nHowever, this is not saying that the true state of the world is all rosy and that the media is manipulating us all, this is not being optimistic for optimism’s sake. Instead, he acknowledged that everything is not fine, and that we should still be very concerned. \"As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change deniers, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education because of their gender, as long as any such terrible things exist, we cannot relax.\"\n\nBut, he elaborates, \"it is just as ridiculous, and just as stressful, to look away from the progress that has been made.\" So instead, he explain it in a simple analogy: we should see the world like we see a premature baby in incubator. Yes her health is critical and it’s bad, we should not relax and stop worrying. But the baby’s condition is improving day by day in the intensive care, so yes the situation is improving. It is both bad and better at the same time. In this light, his brilliant explanation and analysis on the reality of climate change and refugee crisis have completely changed the way I see these problems.\n\nIn this sense, he labels himself with a word that he made up himself: a possibilist. \"It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.\" True to his mission, he dedicate several chapters on teaching us to become a possibilist, including training us to refrain from reacting from URGENT news or message or sale or offer that prompt us to make quick (and rash and uncalculated) decisions NOW!\n\nHans Rosling sadly passed away in 2017, 2 months before the book was published, making this book his last ever contribution to society. In fact, his last days were spent reading and editing the draft that would become this book. And towards the end of the book he provides 5 global risks that we should worry about, the 1st of which was global pandemic, which in 2016-2017 he amazingly described a scenario similar with Covid-19 that we are experiencing right now.\n\nLike many others, I first knew about this book because it is the book that Bill Gates gave away to all graduates in US college and universities in 2018. And after reading it, I get it. I understand why Gates specifically chose this book.",
    "“I didn’t see what I wanted to see. I saw what I was afraid of seeing. Critical thinking is always difficult abut it’s almost impossible when we are scared.”\n\nI heartily recommend Factfulness by Hans Rosling and his co-authors Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Ronnlund. My bookclub picked it because the subtitle (ten reasons we’re wrong about the world - and why things are better than you think) sounded hopeful and we’re all hungry for hope. And I have to say, aside from all the ways Rosling shows how we misinterpret the world and how to combat our all too human instincts, reading it actually did have a wonderfully calming effect!\n\nRosling outlines 10 basic instincts that plague our perceptions of the world: The Gap Instinct, the Negativity Instinct, the Straight Line instinct, the Fear instinct, the Size instinct, the Generalization instinct, the Destiny instinct, the Single Perspective instinct, the Blame instinct, and the Urgency instinct. I found myself guilty of almost all of them in very obvious ways, and probably the ones I didn’t recognize, I’m also playing out in some subconscious (to myself) way.\n\n“Stay open to new data, and be prepared to keep freshening up your knowledge.”\n\nI deeply appreciated being taught that there is no binary between \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries - rather a continuum from Level 1 to Level 4, each with its own set of challenges. It took the World Bank 17 years and 14 of Rosling's talks to stop espousing this false binary, so maybe it's not so shameful that it took me 45 years to stop doing it myself.\n\nEach chapter has a textbook-like ending with tips and tricks to deal with each of these biases. “Tips and tricks” is far too pat a way to describe the often simple, elegant, and profound advice he proffers. For example, his phrase “bad and better” is about being able to hold two conflicting ideas in your head: that the world is bad and that it’s getting better. So one could both acknowledge very dire problems as well as the progress and solutions that have happened and are to come. This is not to minimize the issues, but to understand how the world actually works in order to really change it. The benefits to this approach are: 1) be able to see the world or a particular problem more accurately and complexly, 2) devise and/or maintain effective multi-player multi-pronged solutions, and 3) act from a position of knowledge and power and hope rather than one of despair and stress.\n\nThat last bit alone was validation enough for me. We live in a time that feels overwhelming and hopeless at times, and it was an enormous relief to be able to acknowledge our very real accomplishments and progress, as well as the proposition that some of what we’re doing is working - perhaps too slowly for our liking, but it’s working.\n\nFor example, we’ve achieved enormous success in increasing child survival and almost all of it has been achieved through “preventive measures outside hospitals by local nurses, midwives, and well-educated parents. Especially mothers: the data shows that half the increase in child survival in the world happens because the mothers can read and write.”\n\nThat last underpins Rosling’s oft-repeated mantra of education and contraceptives as part of the solution to eradicate poverty, curb population growth, and give people better lives. He calls eradicating extreme poverty a moral imperative and I can’t think of much better goals.\n\n“We should be teaching our children humility and curiosity.”\n\nAnother example of progress referred to our disaster prevention measures and other modern indicators and technologies. Because of these, the number of deaths from acts of nature is now just 25% of what it was 100 years ago. Keep in mind that during that same time, our population increased by 5 billion people, so the drop in deaths per capita is even more astonishing: just 6% of what it was 100 years ago.\n\nBangladesh comes up several times in the book, and not as a basket case as is often the case in the news, but as an example of inspirational progress. For example, after far too many devastating floods and cyclones and ensuing famines, the Bangladeshi government installed a country-wide digital surveillance system connected to a freely available flood-monitoring website. Just 15 years ago, no country in the world had such an advanced system. It has also improved its economic position drastically, going from a level 1 country (one marked by extreme poverty) to level 2 in just 4 decades.\n\n“Insist on a full range of scenarios.”\n\nI found myself giving the most pushback in the chapter that tackled environmental concerns, which Rosling readily acknowledges at the outset of the chapter as one of the most pressing issues humans face. Ok, so the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. Is that a reason to rest on our laurels? Not that Rosling counsels any resting - on the contrary, his life is testament to an almost maniacal commitment to help the world’s young and poor and helpless. But I kept thinking: everything is horrible and our wildlife and seas are dying - we have to do something drastic now! Ironically, this was also the chapter about the urgency instinct, and how the now-or-never/either-or way of thinking is probably the wrong approach. Touché, Dr. Rosling.\n\nI took almost 9 pages of notes while reading Factfulness, and it almost felt like taking a (great) course. I wish I had had the chance to see Rosling talk in person but there are apparently dozens of TEDtalks and other lectures he’s given, online (sadly, he passed away just before the book came out). And I’m glad the waiting list at the library was so long that I ended up buying the book, because it’s one I will reread and quote and learn from for a long time to come.\n\nFactfulness was a breeze to read, written in a highly engaging style, and chockfull of personal anecdotes, statistical details, and global trends. I hope everyone reads it and feels charged and ready to continue changing the world for the better.\n\n“Welcome complexity. Combine ideas. Compromise.”",
    "I just finished this book yesterday and to be honest, I have mixed feelings of what this book talks about.\nThe book literally begins with a tone of “Why I am right and everyone is wrong” – because I gave simple questions to a lot of people and they all got it wrong. Well, people got it wrong because they have been conditioned to it, it’s the failure of our education and society in general, nothing wrong with that. The whole premise of the book is that we need to open up our eyes to the wide array of positive changes that are taking place in the world, and the world is getting better at most of the metrics be it child mortality, per capita income, healthcare, deaths to due to diseases, children being vaccinated, literacy levels, gender equality and what not. On the face of it, yes, mostly the world is getting better and it can be proved with data and statistics.\n\nWhat did I like about the book?\n1. Rosling tells you to believe that world is getting better (and he proves so with the use of data), and at the same time keep an eye out for the bad things (because they need to be improved too). I think this is a realistic world view, where you celebrate the progress and keep working on improving the things that need attention.\n2. Every statement is supported by facts, figures, charts and a lot of data (simple to understand).\n3. The book basically imbibes a more realistic (if positive is too strong a word here) outlook towards the world.\n4. You learn to look at data cautiously, trying to overcome your bias and instincts.\n5. You learn to look at media publications, news etc with a pinch of salt and would know better than they prefer showing ‘bad’ stuff rather than ‘good’ stuff. The media blows everything out of proportion and unfortunately, most people believe it.\n6. Finally, you learn about your 10 instincts and would be more aware of them whenever you hear any news or information that talks about how bad the world has become. You learn to look at things from multiple perspectives, suppress these instincts, and eventually be more rational.\n\nWhat I did not like about the book?\n1. The book is based on figures and statistics to prove the point. But as it’s true with statistics, there’s more to it than what meets the eye. For example, Rosling says there’s no such thing as a ‘Developed’ and ‘Developing’ country anymore, a majority of the countries are now ‘Middle Income’ countries. He’s right, no doubt about that. But what makes up a ‘Middle Income’ country. If you make more than $2 a day, you are in the middle-income group. But does that ensure a good living? What is the meaning of $2 in the context of living standards? Isn’t this progress so slow that many generations will not even witness the progress?\n2. Rosling has used averages to convey the point of progress while cautioning the user against them at the same time. As compared to maybe a few decades ago, there are only 1 Billion people living at Level 1 (Extreme Poverty) and trends show you that this number has decreased drastically. But if you look at it in absolute terms, we are talking about 1 Billion people on this planet who don’t get enough food to eat on a daily basis! That’s a huge number.\n3. Rosling has underplayed suffering and lack of resources, and covered it with the statistically correct ‘progress’. It’s like saying, so what if your food lacks nutrition and variety, at least you’re getting better than what you were getting a decade back. It’s funny really and seems such a farce at times. Definitely, he’s not wrong when he says progress has happened, but the meaning of ‘progress’ would differ for different people. His overall thesis, that we live in a much better world than we imagine, is comforting, but “better” might still be “terrible” in some cases.\n\nLet’s look at the book summary now! Rosling talks about our ten ‘Dramatic Instincts’ (and 10 reasons why we are wrong about the world). Here they are –\n\n1. The Gap Instinct - We tend to divide the things into 2 distinct groups and imagine a gap between them. To control gap instinct, look for the majority. Beware of the averages, if you look at the spread, the majority will overlap. Beware comparisons of extremes (Media loves to do it).\n\n2. The Negativity Instinct - We tend to instinctively notice the bad more than the good. We need to learn to acknowledge the fact that things can be both ‘better’ and ‘bad’ at the same time. Example, education levels have improved over time, but still, 10% of the children don’t get any education, that’s bad. We also need to know that good news is never reported, media would hype the bad stuff always. Subsequently, gradual improvement isn’t reported either. Countries, government, media often try to glorify the past, so we need to be beware of these rosy pasts.\n\n3. The Straight Line Instinct - When we see a line going up steadily, we tend to assume the line will continue to go up in the foreseeable future. To control this instinct, remember that curves come in different shapes. Finally, don’t assume straight lines if data doesn’t show it.\n\n4. The Fear Instinct - We tend to perceive the world to be scarier than it really is. We overestimate the risks associated with violence, captivity, contamination etc. The world seems scarier because what you hear has been carefully selected to be told. Remember, Risk = Danger x Exposure, and act accordingly. Make decisions only when you’re calm, not when you are afraid.\n\n5. The Size Instinct - We tend to see things out of proportion, over-estimating the importance of a single event/person that’s visible to us, and the scale of an issue based on a standalone number. A lonely number may seem impressive in isolation, but can be trivial in comparison to something else. Hence, always look for comparisons. Use the 80/20 rule. When comparing countries, look for rates per person.\n\n6. The Generalization Instinct - We tend to wrongly assume that everything or everyone in a category is similar. Hence, we must look for differences within a group, look for similarities across groups and look for differences across groups. We should beware of the term ‘Majority’ – it can mean 51% or 99% or anything in between. Beware of vivid images, which are easier to recall but can be exceptions than the general norm.\n\n7. The Destiny Instinct - We tend to assume that the destinies of people, cultures, countries etc. are predetermined by certain factors, and such factors are fixed and unchanging, i.e. their destinies are fixed. To control this, we must keep track of gradual changes and improvements. We should update our knowledge on different subjects, and look for examples of cultural changes.\n\n8. The Single Perspective Instinct - We tend to focus on single causes or solutions, which are easier to grasp and make our problems seem easier to solve. It is better to look at problems from multiple perspectives. To control this, always test your ideas and allow people to find weaknesses. Don’t claim to be an expert at all times, be humble about your limited expertise in different areas.\n\n9. The Blame Instinct - When something goes wrong, we instinctively blame it on someone or something. To control this, resist finding a scapegoat. Look for causes, not villains. Finally, look for systems and processes, not heroes.\n\n10. The Urgency Instinct - We tend to rush into a problem or opportunity for fear that there’s no time and we may be too late. To control this, take small steps. Always insist on data rather than making hunch based hasty decisions. Always be aware of the side effects of your hasty decision to avoid making the same.\n\nFavorite Quotes from the Book:\n- “The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.”\n- “Being always in favor of or always against any particular idea makes you blind to information that doesn’t fit your perspective. This is usually a bad approach if you like to understand reality.”\n- “Forming your worldview by relying on the media would be like forming your view about me by looking only at a picture of my foot. Sure, my foot is part of me, but it’s a pretty ugly part. I have better parts.”\n\nTo sum up, Factfulness is a good book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. However, we must learn to look beyond the displayed ‘progress’ also, because even lesser suffering can mean ‘progress’ statistically.",
    "I like the author a lot, but I think the content could fit into a 15 min TED talk. Oh, that’s right, it did (search his name on TED’s website). It’s worth 15 mins for sure - but the content in the book just did not expand enough to justify an actual book (seems there was some monetisation going on here - but I suppose everyone has the right to make money from their fame, posthumously, in his case - sadly). Unfortunately, I thought the author also fell foul of his own “lessons of what not to do” on several occassions - making “assumptions” without full investigation, or not defining things properly, etc. (He sets the bar high, to be fair). Example - he asks the reader to guess what % of the world population lives in extreme poverty (and he points out most people are guilty of using data from 20-30 years ago), but then he basically uses a definition of poverty from 20-30 years ago - without considering that the definition might also have progressed in the “common” sense of the word. So he should have been more specific about his definition before asking the question.",
    "Most of you would have either seen the late Hans Rosling's TED talks or read about Bill Gates praising him on his blog. The subtitle of the book - 10 reasons we're wrong about the world and why things are better than you think - stays true to his TED talk persona. He is a medical doctor who brilliantly uses statistics and visuals to show us how most of us are ignorant about the world, and how things are a lot better than we think and improving even faster.\n\nHowever, the book format allows him to move way beyond this and Factfulness is by far the best book about developing sound real-world thinking and practical judgment that I have ever read. It ranks way up there on this hard-to-teach topic alongside studying the lives and words of people like Lee Kuan Yew, Charlie Munger and Charles Darwin.\n\nThe book entertainingly spans evidence-based reasoning, statistical thinking (as opposed to its more common cousin - anecdotal outrage), psychological cognitive biases, self-awareness, looking through media biases (usually towards sensationalist, fear-mongering bad news) and thinking through effective, actionable solutions to material real-world problems including non-intuitive, indirect ones. Rosling is unusual in his ability to abstract out a range of conceptual tools that we can use across situations, while using examples from his experience to keep such concepts relatable and grounded.\n\nRosling's day job was as a medical doctor specialising in controlling epidemics around the world. He has witnessed gut-wrenching tragedy first-hand. However, rather than despair or be guided by emotions, he objectively looks for the most effective solutions that can help do most good even if it worsens the situation immediately confronting him. As an illustration, the most effective tool to limit high population growth in poor countries isn't family planning propaganda but better sanitation (infant mortality is disproportionately caused by contamination of water with sewage and reducing this automatically causes parents to try for fewer children). This then has spillover benefits for family health, women's empowerment and fewer children getting more attention and resources, making it far more likely that the family will escape from abject poverty over a generation.\n\nRosling is a nuanced thinker, able to convey seemingly contradictory thoughts in a way that allows the reader to navigate a grey, messy world rather than a neat, binary one popularised by academics and journalists. As an illustration, he paints a nuanced picture of how things can be both bad and better at the same time. Often, activists are so outraged by things being bad (all we have to do in a place like India is to look around) that they deny any notion that things are actually getting better in many ways. In reality, acknowledging, appreciating and understanding how things are getting better is the way to fix what is still clearly bad.\n\nThis is the kind of book that all of us should read, as a great starting point towards being lesser idiots in whatever we have set out to do.",
    "Like many people I have lived my whole life feeling guilty and deeply depressed about the terrible state of the world -so much so that I have often felt like there was no point in doing anything about it. This book changes everything because it puts all that bad news (which we are constantly inundated with) into fact-based context. The data that is presented in this fascinating and entertaining book challenges just about everything I believed about the world we live in without in any way minimising the changes that still need to be made. This makes me feel not only more positive and hopeful about state of humanity but also that it is worth me making an effort to contribute to the incredible improvements that are taking place daily on the planet, world wide - and that my participation could actually make a difference.\nTruly inspirational and life affirming - read it now!",
    "A perfect demonstration of how to lie with statistics.\nIt is dangerous to put a book out there with dubious statistics, deceiving people who cannot see through the figures. It is avoiding actual figures regarding global warming, quality of life and biodiversity."

    "This is book no. 1 out of 4 on the four Stoic virtues of courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. And courage is the important first piece of the four, because without courage none of the latter three are possible.\n\nSo, what is courage? first and foremost, it is not the absence of fear, but the management of fear. It is using fear as a risk alert and then follows it up with due diligence to define what we’re actually facing.\n\nAs Ryan Holiday remarks, “[f]oresee the worst to perform the best. When fear is defined, it can be defeated. When downside is articulated, it can be weighed against upside. When the wolves are counted, there are fewer of them. Mountains turn out to be molehills, monsters turn out just to be men. When our enemies are humanized, they can be better understood.”\n\n“What we thought were incredible costs,” he then continues, “turn out to be clear calculations—calculations well worth making. The risks, it is revealed, were far outpaced by the rewards. Black swans come into view and can be prepared for. Attacks that we’ve anticipated can be repulsed. The spectrum of possibilities is reduced, the scope of Murphy’s Law is diminished. Vague fear is sufficient to deter us; the more it is explored, the less power it has over us. Which is why we must attack these faulty premises and root them out like the cancers they are.”\n\nIndeed, courage is measuring the danger and carefully calculating our moves to tackle them. Because it’s not whether or not things will be hard (they will) or scary (they are), but it’s about our response of sizing up our obstacles, making plans to defeat them, train for them, and attack them one step at a time.\n\nCourage is also the decision to still go ahead despite the unfavourable odds from our due diligence, when it’s the right thing to do. It is the firefighter rushing into a burning building, the whistleblower taking on corrupt powerful people, the entrepreneur going into business alone, the activist protesting against tyranny, or John F. Kennedy’s decision to help Martin Luther King Jr. to get out of jail for protesting the segregation even though the move was considered a political suicide.\n\nCourage could also means restraint, as Sun Tzu said “it is best to win without fighting—to have maneuvered in such a way that the enemy has lost before it has even begun.” This is what Abraham Lincoln did by managing to maneuver the South into its unwinnable role as the aggressor in the Civil War. It is what Malala Yousafzai shows when asked about the Taliban that shot her in the face and left her for death, she replied “[e]ven if there was a gun in my hand and he was standing in front of me, I would not shoot him.”\n\nOne lesson that is sobering from this book is that great legendary heroes were all humans after all with the same doubts and fears like the rest of us. For example, in her version of Hero’s Journey, Florence Nightingale at first refused her “call to adventure” because “it’s too hard, too scary, because they must obviously have picked the wrong person.” But sometimes our calling is much bigger than our fear or the risk, and courage means eventually pursuing the calling even when it feel like the whole world is against us. And that is the thin margin that separates the heroes from the rest.\n\nChurchill was 54 years old and could’ve just retired and lived a simple old days when the danger of Hitler started to appear. Steve Jobs could’ve just stayed content with his second act with Pixar and never to attempt the uphill battle to recoup his first invention Apple. And nobody would blame Charles de Gaulle if after fleeing from Nazi prosecution with his wife and kids, he chose to live anonymously in Britain far away from danger and didn’t organise a French uprising.\n\nCourage is also contagious. I love the story from the ancient Greece where when a city-state needed a military help from Sparta, the Spartans wouldn’t send their army, but instead they only send one Spartan commander. As Holiday explains, “[b]ecause courage, like fear, is contagious. One person who knows what they are doing, who isn’t afraid, who has a plan is enough to reinforce an outnumbered army, to buck up a broken system, to calm chaos where it has taken root. And so a single Spartan was all their allies needed.”\n\nMoreover, sometimes courage appears in a split second decision making. As Holiday remarks, “[c]ourage is defined in the moment. In less than a moment. When we decide to step out or step up. To leap or to step back. A person isn’t brave, generally. We are brave, specifically. For a few seconds. For a few seconds of embarrassing bravery we can be great. And that is enough.” And I can’t think of a better example for this than the recent tragedy where an Uvalde teacher shielded her students from a school shooter, thus saving the kids’ lives but lost her own life.\n\nYes, courage can also mean sacrifice. Like the act by Irma Garcia in that Texas school shooting that saved a lot of her students’ lives. It can also appear in the form of a mother who puts her career ambition aside to take care for her sick child. It is the immigrant who works in a menial job overseas despite having a medical degree from back home. It is the employee who resigned from a high-paying job in a company or industry that is making the world a worse place. It is that person who has a unfairly damaged reputation because they’re silently protecting someone else.\n\nAs we have seen, being brave doesn’t mean we are fearless. Far from it. But we can be scared and do it anyway, as the calling or the reason or the purpose are much bigger than our fear. This is what the heroes in history have figured out, that being scared is only a state of mind while being afraid is feeling the fear deeply, with novelist William Faulkner sums it up nicely when he said “be scared. You can’t help that. But don’t be afraid.” And that, in a nutshell, is courage.",
    "What do I mean by portable? This book does not require the reader to dedicate hours of contemplation to each chapter or page. I read most of this book in waiting rooms or on breaks at work. It's very digestible like that. Ryan Holiday really did an excellent job pacing the book and breaking up its chapters.\n\nIt's not some deep treatise on the philosophical notions of courage. It's an evidence-based, historical approach to the Stoic virtue of courage. Courage is not the absence of fear -- it's moving forward in spite of your fear, or because of it.\n\nOthers have been in worse situations than you. Others have done this task before. \"What one man can do another can do\" is a mantra from one of my favorite movies. You can have courage. You can do the right thing.\n\nAlso, I really enjoyed the last chapter. Maybe I've missed it, but I've never heard Holiday go into depth about his life before Daily Stoic. I knew he was a marketing executive at American Apparel, but that was it. I knew there'd been some scandal with the CEO. But that was all I knew and all I cared to know. But Holiday opens up and writes about what happened, his role, and his regrets. He explains where he failed to have courage, and when he began to have it. It was a really honest look back, and one that I truly appreciated because we all have been there -- maybe not at a major company, but certainly all of us have been moral cowards at various points in our lives.\n\nWhile I've always appreciated Holiday's efforts at bringing Stoicism to modern life, that last chapter really made me love and respect him. It's what led me to write this review, in fact.",
    "Ryan Holiday's work on courage is timely and valuable. I'm sure this well-written work will assist many people who have been struggling through the past two-plus years of the pandemic. The stories and anecdotes are well selected, and are designed to offer practical guidance and perspective for the reader to develop courage and coping skills to deal with daily challenges. Excellent.",
    "Love that the chapters are short and to the point - perfect for finding inspiration to dream about right before bed. Only 5-10 min per chapter kept me accountable and prevented excuses to not read - even after a long day and/or when it was already well past my bedtime.",
    "Phenomenal book! Love how it was written - almost like mini-chapters. I’m a single parent who sometimes only gets 10 mins at a time to read. Material/his lens was thought provoking and practical. Loved how he could deliver sometimes hard to understand philosophical information in a way that is understandable to someone who is new to it. He’s real (meaning down-to-earth seemingly like you and I) and very encouraging. Felt like he was an old friend saying some of the hard things only close friends would say! Highly, highly recommend.",
    "This book and author are the best. Ryan Holiday is an inspiration",
    "Great read. Ryan gets his point across in memorable short stories. Short chapters, easy to set down and pick up. Great principles for life. Thanks Ryan.",
    "Another excellent book from the modern day stoic Ryan Holiday which explores the virtue of courage and how you can instill it in your life. He share some excellent historical stories, but more importantly he explores what it takes to be courageous and what can happen wen you aren’t. Reading this book has helped me see the moments where I hesitated and could have been braver, and also sown what I can do to be braver in my life.",
    "Ryan,\n\nYou should by now know that telling just part of a story to make your point is an intellectual misjudgment.\n\nAlthough you write important aspects on the need to be more courageous, you give the impression that we just need to \"stick to what we believe no matter what the consequences are\" or \"make a leap of faith\" - which can result in terrible outcomes if we fail to understand what kind of people one is dealing with or being totally ill-prepared before making the leap.\n\nNo, Reed Hastings did not just make a \"leap of faith\".\n\nNeither Jeff Bezos.\n\nYes, they made a series of risky decisions, but they were clever enough to test the waters and analyse the market before placing all their stakes in their ideas.\n\nDo study their biographies and paint a more accurate picture than creating a fantasy reality - leave that to J. K. Rowling.\n\nAs a final advice, please read again \"The 48 Laws to Power\" by your mentor Robert Greene.\n\nThere is true wisdom in there that you are contradicting in your book.\n\nTo be frank, I'm puzzled how Robert allowed you to publish this book on courage... maybe you should ask the true intentions behind the G.O.A.T.?\n\nThe reason why I give one star is the trully disappointment in this book compared to others you wrote - and a hope that the next in this sequel is better than giving reckless and naive advices.\n\nNuno Reis\nExecutive Coach",
    "If you've read Robert Greene's books, Holiday's 'Courage is Calling' follows a similar style - concepts and philosophies of the human experience are laid out, using historical figures as examples and we're told how we can apply this knowledge to our modern lives.\n\nI do like books like this. I find them fascinating. Your generic philosophy / well-being books can be quite vague and cliché. History books have their use. But the increasing wealth of literature attempting to splice the two, tickles my pickle.\n\nAnd so Holiday should be congratulated on this undertaking. Using the principles of stoicism to motivate the modern reader into reaching their potential is a just and captivating pursuit.\n\nThe reason why I rated it three stars are as follows:\n\n- Though there is an apparent close relationship between Greene and Holiday, Courage is Calling seems to contradict 'Greeneism' in many ways. My take from much of Greene's work is that the world is harsh and competitive and you need to use subtlety and poise to navigate through life. Issues are nuanced, people are complex, so understanding people and using restraint in our interactions is key.\n\nHoliday in this book however [this is again my take] seems to champion a rather reckless and swashbuckling kamikaze approach. 'Just send that angry email', 'just quit your job', 'just move places'. It's all very emotional and drastic.\n\nI tend to adhere to Greene's way of looking at this, and so Holiday's proclamations come across as a naive and overly bolshy without regard to repercussions.\n\nHow realistic is it to expect a working class 21 year old to just quit their job because they dislike their boss? In an age of intense competition for jobs, rising living costs, the ongoing pandemic. Of course Holiday would respond to this saying that courage is needed to make these big decisions, they can work out - but it just seems a bit too Hollywood happy ending, idealistic for my tastes. I tend to favour Greene's pragmatism. But that's just me.\n\nI just disagree with this idea that you should make yourself a matyr to make some kind of vague wider point; and I can't help but feel this take is derived from Holiday's own angst regarding an experience he had at American Apparel.\n\n- Holiday also lost me slightly when he throws in barbed comments about people he disagrees with on issues such as the COVID vaccine, Trump, voting left or right etc. I think these issues, whichever side you align with, are very charged and trigger emotional responses in us all. By declaring one side right and one side wrong, Holiday loses half the readership. It again seems to be naive from someone acting as an authority on human interaction.\n\nI fundamentally believe that there are certain subjects you're best off tackling in a diplomatic way or perhaps avoiding altogether, so the fact that Holiday seems to either ignore this understanding of human psychology or not care, then sullies my trust in him to advise me on how to interact with society.\n\nIt is perhaps a feature from North America where this culture war is particularly toxic and is seeping into many other parts of the West now. This 'goodies v baddies', 2d cartoonish view of both sides of a political issue. It destroys nuance, and creates a very dim 'right v wrong' narrative.\n\nLinked to this is Holiday's attempts in the book to suggest some courage is bad, while other courage is good, and the determining factor of 'good or bad' seems to be whether the agents involved are people he politically aligns with., or those who are opposed. WW2 Japan 'bad', Abraham Lincoln 'good'. In reality no side is wholly good or bad, every cause is nuanced. Good and bad dwell on both sides of every debate.\n\nHoliday also mentions that you have a duty to act in advancing 'the truth' but again 'what is the truth?' everybody will have different perceptions, different opinions.\n\nIt may be that the above is just a consequence of the author and I having different world views; and Holiday isn't to blame for seeing things differently to myself.\n\nI can only praise the undertaking, i just found I disagreed with Holiday on much. You should give it a read and make your own mind up. It is very readable, the chapters are short and choppy and the tone is informal so you can pick it up and read significant amounts at ease.",
    "Love this latest book by Ryan Holiday.\nI was lucky at eighteen to join a job that tested my mettle, but as life in general gets softer few youngsters learn to face down their fears. He’s done a good job here mixing old wisdom and modern advice.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, enjoyed it and still dipping in, but I can’t help feeling he’s missed a trick. An appendix giving real life examples of progressively overcoming fears would’ve been a great extra to this book. (See ‘Fear, the friend of exceptional people’ by Geoff Thompson)\nThe book is good as it stands though, so remains five stars from me.",
    "A lot of people like the style of these books, with short chapters and questions intended to bring about self-reflection. But I don’t think that’s for me any more. I found it quite difficult to establish what ground had been covered, because the short chapters felt shallow to me, and the broken paragraphs were irritating and frustrating to read.\n\nBut that’s just me, I’m probably in a minority. People seem to like these books more than ever, and don’t seem to mind the author’s attempts at political messaging. If you’ve liked the author’s books in the past, you’re probably going to like this one too.",
    "I personally find his tone these days quite grating - it's very knowing and worthy, and completely lacking in humour.\n\nIt's also neither an academic work on the history of courage, nor a self-help book with references of everyday acts of courage, or any personal experiences from the author.\n\nIt's mainly just completely unnuanced stories from heroes of history, that you have to take with a large tub of salt.\n\nI'm glad that he's bringing to the surface ancient values, however a book like: 'A Guide to the Good Life' by Irvine, resonated much more with me."

    "Good read",
    "Love it very much. Hard to find elsewhere. The package was well made to ensure this book at an immaculate state after shipping. Good job indeed.",
    "I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who is long-time BRK investor.\nI must admit, i've always found the \"faux folksiness\" (eg, we never dine in fancy restaurants) of Buffett and Munger highly annoying. However, Munger is obviously way more talented than me, so I decided to read this book\n\nDislikes: First half of book is hero worship from his friends and family. This is pretty useless content (wow, who knew that Mungers family and business associates love the guy?). The design of the book is also very lower middle class -- lots of wasted space, cheezy graphics.\n\nLikes: The latter half of the book contains copies of Mungers speaches, and some of these have wonderful tidbits of \"common sense\" advice. The book is worth buying for this content and only this content.",
    "First of all, this is my first and last book review. I don't write these ever, and I will never write one again. However, seeing this gem had only 6 reviews and I felt this needed to be said.\n\nYou can't afford to not read this. Think of it as a gift to humanity from a higher more intelligent species - Its something you don't want to go through life having missed.\n\nI spend about 16 hours a day researching financial markets/value investing.\n\nI have read over 50 books on related subjects - No book has influenced my thought process more that this one. It is simply amazing.\n\nYou will not get the value from this book when you close the last page, but when you see the world relate in the ways Munger lays out for you. This is one of the greatest minds and business and he tells you his secrets. The last chapter on the psychology of human misjudgment will live on past Munger's days. It is his greatest work and is invaluable information. The way your brain fires and works will literally physically change over time from the things this book teaches you. Its a mind trainer - it teaches you how to look at problems. It is worth its weight in platinum.\n\nI don't care who you are. You need to buy this and pound his ideas in your head. You won't even think its that great as you read it and might even wonder why it is praised so much. Over time, you'll see things how Munger does and start to think like Munger does. Whatever field you are in, this book will help you to look and analyze problems and the world as a whole in a different more intelligent manner. Again, I cannot praise or recommend this book enough. When your done with it and look back years later, this odd review I just wrote will make crystal clear sense to you. Your welcome.",
    "Poor Charlie's Almanac has been on my reading list for the last couple of years. It took me a six-month sabbatical (and then some) to get through it. This is a testament to the information, lessons, references and stories from Charlie Munger. Fundamentally, this book is an encyclopedia of information on what it takes to be successful and to achieve greatness in what it is you want to do in life; all from a very successful and extremely well read (and connected) 90-ish year old billionaire!\n\nLet's be clear, this is not a book that you can quickly skim through, but rather a book you spend quality time with every day; for a good couple of months. This way you're giving yourself the best change of retaining all of Charlie's tidbits of wisdom. One of the great things about this book is the plethora of quotes from successful entrepreneurs, historians, philosophers alike whose ideas and writings have survived the test of time.\n\nSuffice to say, this is one of those books I'm going to re-read, reference and quote for the rest of my life. Well worth a purchase!\n\nThree Key Takeaways from the book:\n1. Charlie knows no wise people who didn't read all the time. It is more than just reading though, one has to grab ideas and do sensible things. Most people do not identify ideas, and if they do, they do not know what to do with them\n2. Diversification in investing is something that Charlie doesn't believe in. His recommendation is to choose three good company stocks and invest accordingly. Interesting approach given most financial advisors typically recommend the opposite\n3. Self-pity is always counter-productive, It's the wrong way to think. And when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else or almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard response. And you can train yourself out of it",
    "This book is both monsterous and a complete pleasure to read. It's as thick as a doorstep and coffee table sized. Housed inside you'll find anything and everything you want or need to know about Charlie Munger and his approach to life and investment. It's not a quick read but each time you pick it up you'll find some sort of gem you can apply to your own situation. At first glance it looks like an expensive purchase but the hours of insight and pure pleasure you'll get from this makes it one of my best value purchases this year.",
    "Overated for the price. Half of the book is covered with pictures of the old man his wife and children. Apparently, the man plans to give the proceeds from this book to charity. That seems disingenuous to me since he is already one of the richest Americans and doesn't need the clutches of the book to impact charity. I love the old man and his annedotes, he has a vast array of knowledge repotire at his disposal, however considering the fact that he only had 1% of the partnership in Berkshire Hathaway one might be inclined to assume that he was at best a sidekick of Warren Buffett. Warren got the old man because it makes him look collaborative while continuing to make his own decisions. He hardly consults Charlie for any investment anymore according to Warren himself. For the price of one book you can buy several other gems out there. If you are collector of books or you want to show it off to your friends then be my guest but I would honestly not be bothered with owning this expensive a book. Knowledge should be free or atleast cheap imo.",
    "Arrived on time and in excellent condition - was a brand new copy.\n\nThe book covers all of the lectures and speeches given by Charlie Munger over his storied career. There is a wealth of content that covers investing, history, psychology, science and much more.\n\nI would encourage everyone to read Poor Charlie’s Almanack as they would learn and gain so much from a man with a vast experience of wealth and intellect.",
    "Most of the battle when you invest is not sabotaging yourself or letting other people or market information scare you. Charlie's advice equips investors with the psychological skills to required to keep investing simple and easy. It's a wealth of advice from someone whose investing philosophy has always been similar to buffett's, but he's not afraid to be blunt about it. He calls his method \"sit on your ass investing\", and I think that's quite a good name. He is frank, witty, at times crass, and it's a really good read.",
    "This has to be the greatest book I have ever read. The wisdom and how you can potentially apply some of these concepts to real life scenarios is simply outstanding. The book is not cheap but worth every penny.\n\nSimply superb 10/10. Charlie thank you for all the wisdom!"

    "What does it mean to be a change leader? In times of fiscal upheaval, can a state agency stay true to its mission and vision? Or, must these be sacrificed on the altar of efficiency to the (presumably) lean God of Economy? These are the challenges that confront our elected representatives, agencies that serve the public, unions that represent the workforce, and their constituencies.\n\nIn \"Leading Change,\" John Kotter reveals his Eight-Stage Process of Creating Major Change:\n\n1. Establishing a Sense of Urgency\n2. Creating the Guiding Coalition\n3. Developing a Vision and Strategy\n4. Communicating the Change Vision\n5. Empowering Broad-Based Action\n6. Generating Short-Term Wins\n7. Consolidating Gains and Producing More Change\n8. Anchoring New Approaches in the Culture\n\nIn Kotter's experience, neglecting any one stage undermines and imperils the entire change effort.\n\nSo it is clear that change is coming. It always does. Particular change can be envisioned in an instant but implementation can take some time. This is especially true in large, complex organizations like government bureaucracies, with highly interdependent structures and systems. Serving the public is a process and jobs are maintained to provide the service. Nearly every process in one system is connected to many other systems, and one change will, of necessity, affect changes to hundreds or thousands of processes. To say that change requires hard work and sacrifice in this environment is an understatement.\n\nChange in a government bureaucracy requires a seismic shift in thinking by those who have been working at the same agency for decades, especially those who really believe they have made a difference for the public good. \"We have always done it this way so why change now?\" Their contributions provide valuable lessons but time marches on. Not only are policies and procedures not cast in stone, but future generations deserve the right to have them evolve. Whether they evolve for the better -or not--is the responsibility of the change agent... basically, you and I.\n\nBy definition, government services \"serve\" the public. The way government serves the public today could not have been envisaged at its founding. America has had some time to think about and see some good ideas become reality. We have codified them, managed them, regulated them, raised revenue from them, underwritten, audited, overseen the audit, re-codified, re-managed, re-regulated, created increasingly complex financing mechanisms, then audited everything again.... It is only natural that before long, the original idea... the \"mission\" and \"vision\" becomes lost in the risk averting, litigious-avoiding (though interconnected) world of bureaucratic government. How do you empower interdependent agencies with different functional missions to work seamlessly together? What can a workforce do when it is saddled with legally mandated interconnected systems that do not fulfill the mission or vision of the agency but are relics of an earlier era, or simply symptoms of jurisdictional overreach?\n\nFor change to really happen and take hold in a governmental bureaucracy, with organizational structures and personnel performing different functions and serving different (sometimes opposing) constituencies, and systems of supports and services serving a large and growing base of populations, the change must produce benefits and personal satisfactions that are superior to the way things are today.\n\nToday it will take more than the desire to \"do more with less,\" or even to \"do more, better.\" Indeed, the organizational culture itself must be changed. Purging unnecessary interconnections can ultimately make a transformation not only possible, but easier. It may not be necessary to consolidate agencies when it would be more efficient to coordinate them instead. Streamline procedures and approval processes by putting systems in place that satisfy regulatory requirements and align with the agency's mission. Government and unions can be powerful allies to responsibly empower a highly trained public workforce. The wins must be real, and they must come soon. Paraphrasing Kotter, \"Truly adaptive governmental bodies with adaptive cultures are awesome competitive machines.\"\n\nAt a visceral level, you have to appreciate change, respect it, embrace it... lead it. \"Leading Change\" reminds us that change starts with you and me.",
    "The font is bigger than expected but that's nothing to complain about. Looking forward to reading it.",
    "What happens when an organization needs to change (if it hopes to be successful in the future) but hasn't put much thought into what the process of change itself looks like? More than likely: failure.\n\nJohn Kotter outlines here a critical difference between change efforts that have been successful, compared to change efforts that have failed. Drawing on decades' worth of experience consulting with firms and coaching leaders, and attentive to ever-increasing globalization of markets and competition, Kotter offers an eight-stage change process. The eight stages are:\n\n1. Establishing a sense of urgency\n2. Creating the guiding coalition\n3. Developing a vision and strategy\n4. Communicating the change vision\n5. Empowering broad-based action\n6. Generating short-term wins\n7. Consolidating gains and producing more change\n8. Anchoring new approaches in the culture\n\nSuccessful change, Kotter argues, \"is 70 to 90 percent leadership and only 10 to 30 percent management. Yet for historical reasons, many organizations today don't have much leadership.\" Kotter articulates what effective leadership -- not management -- actually looks like.\n\nKotter provides a helpful, clear, and concise chapter devoted to each of the eight stages. He articulates precisely what is needed at each critical moment in the transformation process. He provides numerous examples of what happens when any stage is ignored (basically, he suggests that to ignore any of the eight stages will likely lead to failure). Specific guidance and steps are offered at every point along the way. A useful summary of the whole process is provided on page 21.\n\nThe final couple chapters provide a glimpse into the organizations and leaders of the future. \"The rate of change in the business world is not going to slow down anytime soon. . . . The typical twentieth-century organization has not operated well in a rapidly changing environment. . . . If environmental continues to increase, as most people now predict, the standard organization of the twentieth century will likely become a dinosaur.\" The winning enterprise of the twenty-first century will have a persistent sense of urgency, teamwork at the top, people who can create and communicate vision, broad-based empowerment, delegated management for excellent short-term performance, no unnecessary interdependence, and an adaptive corporate culture. Leaders of the future are going to be people with high standards and a strong willingness to learn. Arguing that leadership traits can be learned, Kotter provides examples of people he has known over an extended period of time who once upon a time showed little promise, but who developed superlative leadership skills and have become highly effective, successful, influential leaders. Just as organizations need to continue to continue to change and grow, so too will organizations' future leaders.\n\nOverall, this is a highly readable, useful book. It is obviously useful for leaders in the corporate world. I would argue that it is also highly useful for leaders in ANY organization that is trying to thrive in the twenty-first century. I wish I had read it years ago!",
    "I purchased this book primarily for reference purposes whilst undertaking research for a leadership and management module. Kotter takes a common sense approach and his model is logical and written in a practical sequence. He also presents his own experiences well through use of case study examples. This makes for an easy read and offers a basis for understanding organisational behaviour and development. However, whilst I appreciate that this book was a best seller, I was hard pushed to find validation of the full eight step process. The book does not even contain references to any external sources, and the majority of `evidence' is presented by Kotter himself in follow up articles or books.\n\nDespite the lack of validity, I do value Kotter's ideas. However, whilst I am certainly no match for a Harvard professor, I do not think leading change is as linear a process as Kotter's model suggests. Evidence from my own practice in social services suggests that the development and communication of a vision is of primary importance. This establishes a rationale for urgency by affording individuals opportunity to see what change can actually offer them which, in turn, can nurture their own leadership and team working skills. Urgency, without a purpose, can only be false and unsustainable. Contextual variables, therefore, must be accounted for, and I have found it more constructive to adapt Kotter's framework and consider it alongside other models and theories.\n\n.",
    "Well written with plenty of stories, anecdotes and analogies. Its as if John Kotter was present in every company I ever worked for and on every project I managed ! 'Do your people believe the status quo is unacceptable ?' 'Do they really feel a sense of urgency?' 'Do you have a compelling vision for the future and strategies for getting there?'\nKotter explains why 'Snakes, big egos and reluctant players are the enemy of change and what you can do to win them over ...or get rid of them! Thanks for some great ideas John P. Kotter.",
    "Great book that will get you thinking about the communication of and the ownership of change and new working methods in any organisation as well as the importance of vision. Whilst it could have suffered from the 8 stages feeling a little too 'off the shelf' rather than responsive to real situations, actually the stages offer a sense of sustained focus that is often lacking in this kind of book. The stages feel surprisingly as useful for the linear as the abstract thinkers. Kotter's understanding of change leadership rather than management seems to stand head and shoulders above the other writers in this area. If I have a criticism (it is either a criticism or a suggestion for another book) it is that Kotter's plan for change management could do with asking how it might work in an organisation where the new vision is coming from the bottom up rather than the top down. On the whole, if you are facing change in your organisation and you haven't read this book then I would simply ask you why on earth not?",
    "John Kotter's work is a classic volume on change leadership. The book is readable and the steps which he describes make sense to me. I have found the ideas helpful in my workplace and they have formed part of a leadership course which I recently attended. The hard-back binding which I purchased also makes the book durable and more of a pleasure to handle and read.",
    "This is simply a great book and a very rewarding reading!\n\nKotter gives us two key lessons: companies risk to be overmanaged and underled, while change needs to be led more than managed.\n\nThe proposed 8 step change model is a very powerful tool to lead a company transformation."

    "This book is written in first person which devalues the work. There are also Wikipedia references in this book which absolves this literature of any remaining credibility. Should the author rewrite, with credible references and NOT in first person, I’ll take a look.",
    "Since this is a book about communication, it's important that the book is grammatically sound. After reading the first line in this book, you'll quickly understand that this is not the case with this book. It is rife with grammatical mistakes. Additionally, the book doesn't even take its own advice. It talks about keeping things simple, but the organization of the book is anything but that. It goes off on wild tangents and you're constantly trying to interpret what the author truly means.\n\nMoreover, it just copies and pastes quotes from other works for a large portion of the text. The examples used on the surface sound great, but when you think about the given examples they're just awful. For example, the author talks about how in 1976 Ronald Reagan used a story about welfare fraud to garner support. However, the example used in the book leaves out that this is a political situation where stories are often misleading and that Ronald Reagan actually lost that election. Any executive will probably heavily criticize this example and write you off immediately.\n\nThis book would be better served if it defined who a highly effective person is. It seems that the author thinks a highly effective person is an insurance salesman or Wells Fargo banker. If you fall in that category, this book might serve you well. However, if you're looking for executive advice, do not waste your money. It reads like a college paper that was written at the deadline.\n\nThere is one piece of advice from the book that was good though. The book suggests providing your audience with a one pager to highlight the important points. However, this book, didn't do that. In a book that goes off on wild tangents, it would be greatly beneficial to the reader to have key takeaways. Once again though, this book doesn't take its own advice. I can't stress enough that this book is a waste of money. It might be salvageable if the author hired an editor and organized his thoughts, but he didn't. Until the author decides to take writing seriously, do not buy this book.",
    "Interesting book, and I appreciate the author’s efforts, but it really needs an editor (or a better one if there was one). The author uses Wikipedia at times to support his arguments (!) and sometimes gets a little jazzy with the words (this will make you irresistible!), but overall good. Author also seems to contradict himself at times which is distracting (mentions how stories are persuading but carry little information, then on very next page says stories are incredibly memorable tools for conveying information). I don’t mean to downplay the book — I am enjoying it — I just think it could use a good editor & not use Wikipedia as a reference…\nThis was literally my first review on Amazon. I just felt very compelled to say something because I have never seen an author quote Wikipedia lol, I am in law school and my professors would drop dead if I ever did that in an essay, much less something published",
    "From the onset (grammatical errors and typos aside) it was clear the author didn’t hire an editor. This hardly qualifies as a book given the format, more of a stream of consciousness. Missing are chapter breaks, TOC, glossary, appendix, etc. The author uses entire pages to quote the works of others yet does not properly cite them, clearly no permission was granted to use such extensive sections which are likely copyright violations.\n\nThis book was linked to another book on a similar topic I was buying and because it was ranked as a “best seller” on Amazon, I added it. I should have taken the time to see it is a #1 best seller in the obscure category of presentation software books, this book has nothing to do with presentation software!\n\nThis is not a book on how highly effective people speak either. It's about the psychology of persuasion and influence, neither topic of which the author is qualified. He should have just stuck with what made him so effective in speech & debate and how those lessons transcend successful professional careers.\n\nI struggle to believe the positive reviews of this book are legitimate. The author self-promotes and is trying to sell his communication course throughout (again no mention of presentation software). I’m too embarrassed to put this thing on my bookshelf and I wouldn’t even use it as a paperweight. It is by far the worst book I’ve forced myself to read in years and frankly I feel completely duped. Which begs the question, can we return books for full refund on Amazon?",

    "I’ve always been one to acknowledge my own problems, but am ashamed to say that I’ve acknowledged the “problems” and deficiencies of others more (which I always believed outweighed my own).\n\nQBQ! allowed me to reflect with my inner self and really see what I can do to better any situation at hand, and doing so without pointing the fingers at other people.\n\nIt can be difficult to see ourselves as a potential contributor to a difficult situation but QBQ! helps us realize that sometimes we must correct our own deficiencies for the sake of a positive outcome.\n\nPhenomenal and short read!",
    "What a great book!\n\nI purchased it on Amazon 2/22/11 and finished it today 2/27/11 which is probably an all-time record for me as books I buy usually take months, if not years, to percolate to the top of my to-read list. This one, however, I seemed to keep getting prompts about in my other reading, Amazon searches, and of course regular mentions from Dave Ramsey. I'm currently going through Financial Peace University with my wife and am doing some personal enrichment reading in that regard, including currently reading The Millionaire Next Door and listening to Thou Shall Prosper on audiobook. Hopefully that puts things into perspective.\n\nHaving read quite a few business-related books in the last few years, what sets QBQ apart?\n\n1. An ultra-sharply clear concept.\n\n2. Broad usage potential, both in professional and personal life.\n\n3. Super-fast readability\n\nThis is a 115-page book that reads even faster than that. Most chapters are 1-4 pages long, and not particularly dense pages at that. Each chapter reads as a mini article covering a specific item all of which revolve around the QBQ concept.\n\nWhat is that concept? It's simple: getting to questions in our lives that move us toward positive action. As opposed to all those questions most people use daily in their work and personal lives which attempt to avoid responsibility or place blame on others for the problem of the moment. It really is that simple. But because the concept is so clear, the majority of the book gives examples of how we can rephrase our words and thinking to become more effective at problem solving. More effective ourselves. Not by attempting to change others. Not by anything other than realizing that we simply can NOT change others, and asking questions about why others do or don't do what we want them to do are useless questions.\n\nToo often in this country today people act the victim. \"I couldn't do what I needed to do because that person didn't do their thing.\" \"It's not my fault I burnt my tongue on that coffee, the cup wasn't clearly enough labeled 'HOT!'\" You get the idea. So much of the genius in this country seems to be spent in figuring out how to avoid personal responsibility. At work. At home. At school. In parenting. For anything. Does anyone think this is a good thing? In any way?\n\nTo me, this book is a brief rebellion against that epidemic. It's something I'll make sure my kids read. It should be read by everyone in America, in my opinion. It's a short, easy, fun, enlightening read. Every 6th grader and every high school senior should be required to read it. Twice. Maybe again in college. QBQ is that good a concept.",
    "Because the reviews I have read on here already provide a clear synopsis of the book, I will choose to provide a testimony on the impact QBQ has had on me and those around me. Since personal accountability is about self, I'll begin with me.\n\nIn my work as a leader around the office and through my civic responsibilities, I apply the QBQ wherever I go. As problems arise, my mindset immediately shifts to what I can do about the issue instead of wondering why it happened in the first place. The concept of owning a problem instead of passing the buck is relatively simple, but it's a concept that we all need to be reminded of. The QBQ puts it front of mind for me. This has prepared me for my role as an elected official, where a phone call or email from a resident becomes an \"I get to solve this problem\" instead of \"I have to respond to this resident\".\n\nI have relayed the concept of QBQ to my team and have noticed changes in my employees' thinking. I now see employees coming into my office to begin complaining or venting about a particular situation and, before I can even utter a word, they immediately start saying \"but what I can do is...\". The attitude has shifted to one of problem solving, which is important when the organization shifts its priorities. It has allowed for greater flexibility within my team.\n\nOn the home front, I have a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, and I have been preaching the concept of personal accountability to them for a couple of years now. We have always had great kids who listen to their parents and care, but it's definitely taken it to another level. They solve their own problems (well, most of the time) but they own their choices and consequences. I was proud when my daughter was selected as the award recipient in her class for, you guessed it, ownership. As for my son, a funny moment happened yesterday. After letting our dog out of her room for being in doggy timeout, my son promptly told our dog, \"Maya, it's your choice if you want to be good or bad.\" Couldn't have said it better myself.\n\nQBQ has gotten me to be even more positive, to be a problem-solver, and to be more of a forward-thinker. It's also neat to see it impact those that I work with and especially my children. Such a simple read, such a simple concept, but the impact is bigger than I could have ever imagined.",
    "A very clear presentation of a simple but powerful core concept, with lots of worked examples. I can see how practicing this method could help you to improve at what you do.",
    "Reading the QBQ makes me think about my actual position as mother as employee and manager it makes me instantly think about my level of accountability right now and how it can make a difference. It’s an easy read book to keep it closely and to re-read to keep the accountability mindset actioned all the time !",
    "Fantastic. Everyone should read this book. EVERYONE. I feel like I'm asking the right questions now.",
    "This book is easy and fun to read whilst delivering a very powerful message. I wish everybody read this book. Personal accountability is no new concept however it is easy to fall back into a victim mentality instead of getting a grip on yourself and ask what you can do to influence any given situation.",
    "Out of date. Not deep enough. Disappointed."

    "The author, Dr Atul Gawande is an American general and endocrine surgeon, and public health researcher. I have been meaning to read and review his book for many years. What a fitting introduction to ‘The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.’\nPhilosophers Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre tackled the issue of why we fail at what we set out to do in the world. One reason, they explain is “necessary fallibility”, a consequence of some things in the world, and our lives, being beyond our understanding and control.\nBut there is much that is not, and yet we fail at these too. Gorovitz and MacIntyre suggest that there are two reasons for this: ignorance and ineptitude (incompetence or clumsiness.)\nFor most of human history, people’s lives have been lived largely in ignorance. However, over the last few decades, science has filled in enough knowledge to make our ‘ineptitude’ as much of a challenge as our ‘ignorance’ was in the past.\nGawande’s context is the ineptitude in medicine. While our knowledge and sophistication has grown enormously, the struggle is still how to deliver on this know-how.\nThe knowing-doing gap is found everywhere. From the frequent mistakes authorities make when disaster strikes, to the legal mistakes our lawyers make that are the result of little more than simple administrative errors.\n“Every day there is more and more to manage and get right and learn,” Gawande points out. With all we are required to manage, failure happens far more often - despite great effort rather than from a lack of it.\nExpertise has been seen as the solution to ineptitude in most areas of work – “they need more training!” and modern medicine has been no different. But capability clearly isn’t our primary difficulty; in most fields training is longer and more intense than ever. In the early twentieth century, you could practice medicine with only a high school diploma and a one-year medical degree. Today doctors have six years of university, and three to seven years of residency to practice paediatrics, surgery, neurology, or the like.\nYet our failures remain frequent, but there is a solution – checklists.\nThough this seems almost ridiculous in its simplicity - especially to those of us who have spent years carefully developing ever more advanced skills - it has proven not to be.\nIn 1935 the US Army was looking for the next generation long-range bomber. Boeing’s aluminium-alloy Model 299 was able to carry five times as many bombs as the army had requested, and could fly faster and farther than previous bombers. The army planned to order at least 65 planes until it stalled on a test flight, turned on one wing, and exploded. The crash, attributed to ‘pilot error, killed 2 of the 5 crew members. This prompted Boeing to come up with an ingeniously simple approach: they created a pilot’s checklist. It is worth noting that using a checklist for takeoff was about as odd as using a checklist to back out of your garage.\nHowever, flying this new plane was too complicated to be left to the memory of any person, no matter how expert. The test pilots made checklists for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing, and armed with the checklist, flew a total of 1.8 million miles without one accident. The army ultimately ordered almost 13,000 planes.\nLike flying, many areas of our lives and work have become “too much airplane for one person to fly.”\nFaulty memory and distraction are a constant danger in “all-or-none processes” like going to the shop to buy ingredients for a cake, piloting a plane through a takeoff, or treating a sick person in the hospital. “If you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all,” says Gawande.\nAnother human danger you may well recognize, is allowing yourself to skip steps even when you remember them. You skip steps because it has never been a problem before – until one day it is.\nChecklists can provide protection against such lapses, as they remind us of the minimum necessary steps.\nProfessors Zimmerman and Glouberman distinguish between 3 different kinds of problems: the simple, the complicated, and the complex.\n‘Simple problems’ are ones like baking a cake from a recipe with a few basic techniques you need to learn. Master them and you most likely will have success.\n‘Complicated problems’ are like sending a rocket to the moon. There is no straightforward recipe, and success usually requires many people and great expertise. Unanticipated problems are common, and timing and coordination become serious concerns.\n‘Complex problems’ are like raising a child. You can’t repeat and perfect the process as you can with rockets. Every child is unique, and while expertise is valuable, it is not sufficient. The outcome remains highly uncertain.\nThe value of checklists for simple problems is self-evident: that is why we have a shopping list. But much of the most critical work people do, is not simple. Checklists help prevent failure especially when the problems combine everything from the simple to the complex.\nThe real value of checklists is in conditions of true complexity, where the knowledge requirements exceed that of any individual, and unpredictability reigns. Commands and control from the centre will fail. Under these conditions, not only are checklists a help, they are essential for success. In these complex situations where individuals must exercise their own judgement, this judgement will be enhanced by checklist procedures.\n\nBad checklists are vague and imprecise, too long and hard to use. They are written as if the people using them are stupid, and they try to spell out every single step. Good checklists, are precise and begin with the premise that a checklist cannot fly a plane. That is why, faced with catastrophe, pilots are astonishingly willing to turn to their checklists.\nChecklists come in two forms: DO-CONFIRM and READ-DO. Using a DO-CONFIRM checklist, people do jobs from memory and experience, then stop and check. Using a READ-DO checklist, people carry out the tasks as they check them off, like a recipe.\nTo get value from checklists, they must make sense for the particular situation. A rule-of-thumb is to keep it to between five and nine items, simply worded, and exact.\nDoes this work? This was rigorously tested in the World Health Organization’s ‘safe surgery’ research across a variety of hospitals of different sizes, rich and poor, in countries from Tanzania to the US. In this carefully constructed study, a 2-minute, 19 step surgery checklist, resulted in an immediate drop in infection and mortality in thousands of operations in 8 participating hospitals. Major complications dropped 36%, and deaths fell by 47%.\nThat is how much a checklist can add to the skills of highly trained, highly skilled surgeons. It is worth a serious try in your business. You will get startling results too.\nReadability Light ---+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy, and is the author of the recently released Executive",
    "Fantastic book.. I only have read several books more than 2 times.. This has to be above 4 times and counting. I take notes on books but sometimes you just need to read it again.\n\nThe author writes in a way where you feel you are just hanging out and he is telling you powerful and interesting stories.. Stories that can affect your life in an amazing way if you pay attention.\n\nThe essence of the book from my perspective is this... We are human and imperfect.. Profoundly so... Checklists are a simple and humble way to not miss the important things of what you are doing.\n\nMost still probably won't use them.. Even after this book.. It's a pride thing to some extent I reckon but for anyone that applies what they read here.. It will improve your life in just about anything that involves more than 1 step and... It's free to do.. Less the cost of this book.\n\nEnjoy.",
    "Great story telling of how checklists were created and used in critical situations. Despite the seemingly boring topic, the author has made this a real page turner. I'm not in the medical field, but can easily follow the terminology and situations discussed, thanks to the author's skill. I'm thinking now of more ways to start using checklists in my job and personal life to improve and simplify them. This is the second book I've read by Atul (the other was Being Mortal). I'm sad to have finished this so quickly, but I'm glad he has a couple other books that I can read, and I don't even care what the subject is (Atul is that good!).",
    "As a Mayo Clinic registered nurse, now retired from critical care and emergency nursing, I have read all Dr. Gawande's books. And I've always had an interest in why things go wrong,, how did this happen, can it be prevented?\n\nOne need not have a medical background as all his books are well written in everyday, easily understood language.\n\nHe uses real life stories to illustrate the critical point he is making. I didn't know about Walmart's heroic efforts to save lives during Katrina's horrific takeover of New Orleans. The CEO boldly communicated from the top down through every level of Walmart employees, telling them they would be called on to make decisions far beyond their usual jobs. \"Just do the right thing; take care of people.\"\n\nThe communication, the feeling of esprit de corps led to in one instance to a female employee mounting a bulldozer and driving through a water laden store picking\nup every useful item that wasn't soaked. After delivering items to people needing help outside the store, she turned around with her dozer and went back in for another load.\n\nKudos to Walmart for demonstrating the power of communication, the results of building a united team and then\ngiving authority to members of the team.\n\nThis particular book is a fine example of how checklists work not only in medicine but across other professions as well. His stories of how buildings are built, how planes fly and how investment fund managers make selections was fascinating.\n\nI highly recommend this book written by a humble man who just happens to be a brilliant critical thinker deserving of every accolade he has received.",
    "I was recommended this book when I was doing a clinical training. It taught me to think more thoroughly before doing things and make smart moves. I am glad that surgeons and nurses in the opertaion room are still following this protocol. This action shows their responsiveness to patients. Even if you are not working in the field of medicine and clinics, this is still a good guideline to our daily life.",
    "This is more than a book, it is a groundbreaking transformation. Having worked in the wider healthcare sector for over 30 years (not a clinician), you understand the levels of authority, the egos, and intransigence of senior medical consultants, especially in relation to their juniors and nurses. The challenge has been, to inculcate something so obvious and relatively easy to implement, causes concerns that much of hard-earned experience and intellect can be reduced to checklists. Surely we need as many fail-safes as possible when peoples lives are at risk.\n\nAtul Gawande has presented compelling evidence that checklists can have a dramatic impact on quality of care and healthcare outcomes. He has shown that this is repeatable around the world and not just in the poorer regions. If an aircraft pilot fails, he goes down with the plane. If the same consequence was applied to the failure of a medical consultant - we'd have checklists in every hospital tomorrow!",
    "This is the second book of Atul Gawande's I have read. I really enjoy his easy ability to illustrate his points with relevant stories and particularly in this book using the Hudson River plane incident as an example.\nHe has given me food for thought around the use of checklists in my own work. I feel inspired to develop one at least for myself which I may then be able to pass on to my team.\nI enjoy the philosophical approach he has to life, medicine and writing.\nI thoroughly recommend this book as not only thought provoking but also an enjoyable read.",
    "The checklist manifesto seems to be the favourite productivity book of some people. I came across it because I saw someone rave about it on Twitter. However, I feel a bit lukewarm about it. First, I think that the book is too long. There are many examples and anecdotes about the usefulness of checklists, but, in my view, they achieved little more than repeating the point that checklists can be a powerful tool. Second, the actual practical advice for designing useful checklists is too short. This practical advice could be summarised in less than a page. Third, the application of checklists in all different areas is quite common knowledge now. This might be in part attributable to the book, which came out quite a while ago. I think it would be great to update the book with some expansions that are more contemporary. For instance, the use of templates to structure processes and thinking could be discussed alongside checklists. I think the book is still a worthwhile read, especially for readers who are not familiar with checklists or for readers with a medical background who may enjoy the many examples from that area.",
    "As the title suggests, The Checklist Manifesto outlines the benefits of using checklists in various situations from the perspective of Atul Gawande, a leading surgeon. Atul sets out to find a solution for the problem of complexity in medicine by objectively researching different contexts, from project managing extremely complex building developments to piloting planes. A large emphasis is placed on situations such as disasters, where time is of the essence and there is a limited time to react to the situation at hand, much like would be found in the operating theatre, where the basis of the book originates.\n\nI enjoyed the methodical approach of following Atul on his journey, trying to get to the crux of checklists, how (or if!) they are beneficial to situations and how a balance can be struck between having sufficient information to be useful whilst not overbearing the user to the point where the list becomes disregarded. He uses examples such as investment fund managers, third world disease prevention schemes, professional kitchens, and of course hospitals whilst using various statistics to bring the narrative to life.\n\nA number of real world disasters are cited which keep the book gripping and interesting, and help to outline the reality the checklists aren’t to make the user into a methodical robot, but how it helps to strike a balance between communication, delegation and preparation. The bottom line of the theme is that the effects of using checklists are subtle taken on an individual situation basis, but in unlikely circumstances or taking the statistical data over a large number of samples, a clear picture gets painted. Checklists, particularly in the context of surgery or plane mishaps, are fundamental to team cohesion and just by taking the simple of step of introducing names before surgery or a flight can have a profound effect on achieving desirable outcomes.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it, it does provoke thought into how checklists could be used in other situations and the problem of the human ego that leads dismissal of procedures that can have profound beneficial effects.",
    "If you are a clinician and haven't read this book... YOU SHOULD. It has fundamentally changed the way we work, write consent forms and perform handovers. Errors clinical or clerical have all but ceased, WHEN the check lists we created for patients / clients are used. The results are stark. Read it, think about it and implement appropriately. You will not be disappointed. Like the Author I have found getting initial \"buy in\" takes a fair push, but don't relent."

    "El libro un bien libro es de pasta dura parece Biblia, pero me llego con el empaque roto !",
    "manifesting financial blessings.. will read over and over again. really enjoyed the self assessment portion and could not have thought that deeply about my subconscious / motivations without it",
    "Book was used, there were some highlighted text.",
    "I have purchased this book many times and always end up gifting it to friends and strangers. I have used the techniques in this book and see results in twightlight zone sort of ways. More importantly I realized we are always using them on autopilot through subconscious or even unconsciously. Practice the methods until it becomes a dominating thought. Think of what you desire and and then believe it's possible. You may need to think of circumstances that are unusual but in your mind believable. Or another method is through autosuggestion. Repeat it to yourself over and over until it reaches your subconscious and you believe it into existence. You MUST BE VERY SPECIFIC. My first attempt was for like New Backpack Leaf Blow I could try to fix. Who's gonna give away such a valuable item? I believed a circumstance would come up where some says.. \"you can have it\". Two weeks later it happened after using the methods in the book. I had to adjust my request as I had put the word \"try\" in my desire. Latter I came up with larger goals.. to save 10k and to make 10k in a month when my income was lucky to be 3500. This took a little longer but after weeks of repeating it to myself that I have $10k I counted my money and I realized I made $10k in 2.5 weeks! Ask carefully as I am so busy now that I'm having a hard time balancing my life. I'm learning what to ask for and how to ask for it 😌😉✌🤟",
    "This book will change your life if you follow it and if your ready for it most amazing book ever",
    "According to Wikipedia, Think and Grow Rich is reputed to have sold more than 30 million copies.\n\nWalking around a bookstore I could not help but notice this very attractive edition of this book. With its black leather bound cover, its gold lettering, the red string bookmark, and pages etched in gold leaf it called to me like a sultry siren.\n\nI could not resist despite the fact that I already own 2 copies of this book. This is the big daddy of self improvement books, a classic book with amazing ideas.\n\nWhen you read this book you will learn Hill's strategies gleaned from some of the most successful people who ever lived, people like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe further you get into this book the more will appreciate ideas such as the Mastermind Principle, Decision making and using the subconscious mind. Some of these ideas are eyebrow raising. For example, transmutation of sexual energy. Perhaps my favorite idea is the Invisible Council.\n\nIf you like this book, you will love his other work The Laws of Success, which goes into these principles in a lot more detail.\n\nHere are some quotes: \"The kite of success can only fly high against the wind of adversity.\"\n\n\"The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does.\"\n\n\"Our minds become magnetized with the dominating thoughts we hold in our minds and these magnets attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating thoughts.\"\n\n\"Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.\"\n\nThis version of this book looks ridiculously good, and would make a great present, and also looks great on your bookshelf. I think you will love it, and so will your friends if you get it as a gift.\n\nOne of his success principles is Desire, so the more you desire and can imagine the benefits this book will bring, and the changes it will make on your life, the more likely you are to buy this book.\n\nOther books that I recommend are Success Principles by Jack Canfield, and Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by Harv T Eker.\n\nI hope this was useful, and I think you will enjoy the book..",
    "Read it a couple years ago . Changed my life! You can manifest anything In life . This book might just help you get there.",
    "I love this book, I was bought the paperback last year as a gift but it was not the original text and sadly began to look a little battered around the edges.\n\nThe small extra cost was worth every penny; I guess I can see why they adjusted some of the wording - it might be considered inappropriate in todays overly sensitive world.\n\nHOWEVER - this was written in a time when people thought very differently and as such it should be taken for what it is.\n\nThis edition of the book is quite lovely really, the quality speaks for itself and is a must for anyone who is inspired to return to napoleon hills teachings again and again.\n\nMy only complaint if any is it is advertised as 'leather bound' but the inlay card says 'affordable vegan leather!'\n\nTo be honest I had to google what that meant, after all I cant really imagine anyone attempting to eat a book cover (although you never know)\n\nBasically it means fake/synthetic. So perhaps it should be listed as such. I would have gladly paid more for real leather!?\n\nApart from that - would recommend it to anyone and if it wasnt for the vegan thing it would have got 5 stars :)",
    "It is without a doubt the best of the best. I can't say how much good this book is. Learn to serve people in the most quantity and quality if you really want success. If you understand the statement that says you will definitely reap what you sow, then you must also understand the previous statement as an undeniable truth.\n\nEach of the principles described is a stone you can clone to build your success. Staturate your mind with this book, every single day, until you read it three times. I say only three times because then you will not want to stop.\n\nI read this book every day and it has definitely made me a better man. A profound change is still happening in me and will keep happening for the better.\n\nIf you are smart enough you will certainly not regret it.\n\n(This or any version is fine for you, but I recommend this or any other with the original text only).",
    "Bought this version for my girlfriend she absolutely loves it, what a powerful book, this is a must for everyone, excellent service highly recommended",
    "Great boot, hard to believe this was originally written nearly 100 years ago, Napoleon hill was far ahead of his time in relating the problems we face in this century and will continue as individuals and people, this book does what it says on the tin thinking rich and abundant.",

    "This is an updated and revised version of a book first published in 2008. The first four chapters are essentially the same. \"They set out the basic framework of our approach, including the term [begin italics] libertarian paternalism [end italics], which only its authors love.\"\n\nHow specifically, does this edition differ? \"Two important topics are given new chapters early on. The first is what we call [begin italics] Smart DIsclosure [end italics] The idea is that governments should consider the radical thought of moving at least into the twentieth century in the way they disclose important information....Widespread use of Smart DIsclosure would make it possible to to create online decision-making tools that we call [begin italics] choice engines [end italics] , which can make many tasks as easy as it has become to find the route to get to a new restaurant.\n\n\"We have also added a new chapter on what we call [begin italics] sludge [end italics], which is nasty stuff that makes it more difficult to make wise choices...We introduce several choice architecture concepts, in addition to 'sludge,' that are new to this edition...These concepts play a large role in the chapters about financial decision making. We have increased the space we devote to climate change and the environment.\" [Pages xiii-xiv]\n\nAccording to Barry Schwartz, \"What Kahneman and Tversky did for the basic psychology of decision making, Thaler and Sunstein did for policy. In domains as disparate as savings, health care, driving, energy conservation, eating, and even urinating (by men), Thaler and Sunstein provide evidence that left to their own devices, people often make mistakes, sometimes very consequential ones, and that these mistakes can be mitigated or even eliminated if institutions take an active role in doing so.\n\n\"The oxymoronic term 'libertarian paternalism' captures much of the thinking behind Nudge. Its recommendations are paternalistic in that they try to steer people in the right direction.  But it is libertarian in that people are free to resist nudges if they choose to do so. This libertarian paternalist approach has come to be called 'soft paternalism,' in that people are influenced, but not required, to move in certain directions.\"\n\nSo, what's a nudge? Sunstein has explained it this way: \"A nudge is an intervention that maintains freedom of choice but steers people in a particular direction. A tax isn’t a nudge. A subsidy isn’t a nudge. A mandate isn’t a nudge. And a ban isn’t a nudge. A warning is a nudge: “If you swim at this beach, the current is high, and it might be dangerous.” You’re being nudged not to swim, but you can. When you’re given information about the number of fat calories in a cheeseburger, that is a nudge. If a utility company sends something two days before a bill is due, saying that “You should pay now, or you are going to incur a late fee,” that is a nudge. You can say no, but it’s probably not in your best interest to do so. Nudges help people deal with a fact about the human brain—which is that we have limited attention. The number of things that we can devote attention to in a day or an hour or a year is lower than the number of things we should devote attention to. A nudge can get us to pay attention.\"\n\nThaler and Sunstein nudge their reader to consider being a \"choice architect\" who \"has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.\" They offer dozens of examples from their own experience and remind me of several of mine. Here's one. While attending a reception in Washington for a new UK ambassador to the United States, I became engaged in conversation with one of his aides.  When I asked him how he defined diplomacy, he replied, \"Letting the other chap have it your way.\"\n\nThat in essence is what nudging others is all about. Moreover, many of those who read this book may be encouraged to use some of the material to nudge themselves when making what may initially seem to be relatively minor decisions but could perhaps have important implications and even very serious consequences in months and even years to come. That is what one of the characters in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises indicates when explaining how his company became bankrupt: \"Gradually and then suddenly.\" The same is true of tooth decay and compound interest on credit card debt. Here's a positive example: What if you set aside only one dollar a day, every day, since you first went to work full-time?\n\nThose who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow.",
    "I haven't read the previous editions, and it's very interesting to read this final edition in a time where many nudges (and sludges) have been seamlessly implemented in our daily life following the initial introduction of the concept by the authors many years ago. As many other reviews have point out, this book doesn't really teach you behavioral economics as a textbook would, and most discussions concern the design of public policies. However, I still have benefited a lot from reading this book even I don't design any policies. After reading, I have become more able in identifying the nudges and sludges in my life, and there are many \"ah-ha\" moments when I realised that I am being nudged. It also taught me to think twice about the default, and allows me to assess the intention of a choice architect by reverse-engineering the choice architecture. This could be a potential life-changing ability, as it helps me to be more aware and make more informed decisions.",
    "This is an easy and interesting read. Thaller adds a new dimension to how we try to make decisions and how to help make better decisions by simplifying the process.",
    "Came quickly, super digestible read.",
    "I found this Final Edition of NUDGE very informative and readable. It's an eye-opener as to how to get things done and how to get people to start thinking in the manner required. I just thought that all the examples were more based towards the USA, and maybe Sweden and the UK, and not sufficiently towards global needs. But yet, very readable and informative",
    "I'd read multiple reviews of this book and actually heard an interview with one of the authors and was really looking forward to reading it. Now that I'm finished, I have to say that it was not as good as I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not bad and it does have a lot of very interesting aspects to it. I honestly think that they could have gotten 99% of the point across in half the pages with any amount of effort. There was a level of repetitiveness that was not necessary in the slightest.",
    "The information in this book would also be very useful for people in Customer Service.\nCustomer Service professionals often deal with people who don't have all the information they need.\nA nudge would put a lot of customers at ease and get them what they really need.",
    "I teach a course in holistic leadership which includes a unit on decision making. Not one to use typical textbooks, these graduate students LOVED this read. It is a fabulous read. Highly recommend.",
    "This book is very disappointing, and the subtitle misleading: It does not provide any practical advice on making or encouraging better decisions.\n\nThe book retrospectively examines situations, mostly in the USA, where nudge could have helped people with their choices—with healthcare plans, Social Security contributions, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The effectiveness of nudging in those cases is circumstantial, but there is arguably a need for it. However, because what the author says is terribly common-sensical, the book feels like an overstatement of nudging.\n\nWhat follows is the essence of this book without the fluff.\n\nSome people cannot think rationally; therefore, decisions should be made on their behalf. But instead of depriving them of freewill, we must nudge them towards the desirable choices so they have the illusion of control.",
    "This book is crying out, desperately pleading on its knees for an editor. Every sentence is repeated. For example in the first page, the word 'school' is mentioned 5 times within two lines. It feels like a child attempting to pad an essay word count, whilst simultaneously being extraordinarily patronising. Returned for a refund, much better books on the subject.",
    "It is a very American book. Alot of what is mentioned is based on American lifestyle. 3 stars I wasn't a bad book, just alot of it is irrelevant outside of the States",
    "(This review is of the Kindle edition) When the book first emerged in the UK it was taken up by professional politicians - seeking what Winston Churchill called \"the art of the possible\". What one doable thing can you execute that enables a broader/deeper social phenomenon?\n\nAnd the authors do it well. Clear writing, effective examples, and a gradual build towards a strong understanding of what makes societies and individuals tick, and why they make the decisions they do. I found it a good read alongside Kahneman's \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" which goes more into the psychology side; Thaler and Sunstein are more practitioners. Definitely worth reading.",
    "Most of the content of this book is covered elsewhere - (\"Thinking, fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman\" is a better read) but the book brings together some interesting points about nudges for behaviour change. As with most books about human behaviour, it's a question of looking for the interesting nuggets rather than expecting a solid block of fascinating material but it's worth a go. If I were to buy again I'd get the paper version not the Kindle one: the indexing doesn't make it easy to flick between sections and that's what you need to do when you're nugget-trawling."

    "Whether you are in the process of trying to raise money, or understand how VC’s work, or even just learning something new, this is a must-read. Breaks everything down to be as easily digestible as possible. Everyone in the whole tech startup ecosystem should have this one in their collection.",
    "I liked it so much i gave mine away after the 3rd chapter and bought another one...then i bought the Audible version.",
    "Excellent book, both as a “cover-to-cover” read and a permanent reference. I found it invaluable at several stages in my company. Early on when considering whether or not to raise capital, this provided us an in depth look at the challenges and pitfalls we’d face even after securing funding (I'm glad we waited!). A couple of years later, with an informed decision to raise, this book again helped us have intelligent conversations with potential investors to make sure we could find a fit for both sides of the table.",
    "Content book is cool but the presentation with a paper override the book it’s not cool to save or present in your library",
    "It can be a slow read at times, but it is so valuable. The information you will get by dedicating to this book is great. I have a long background in finance and learned a great deal more from reading this.",
    "Great book to read! Helpful in understanding the thought process behind venture deals. It’s a suggested resource to the techstars/Kaufman online course and was recommended to me by an investor.",
    "This book is very readable, which is difficult to do with a technical topic like this. It maps out what you need to know and does so very efficiently and with subtle humor. These guys know their stuff well enough to make it concise and interesting.",
    "I was read at now about 5 books of vc topics.. I want the time machine and start with Venture deals.. thanks for write",
    "Brad and Jason are both seasoned VC veterans and share their knowledge generously in this book. The book covers topics such as term sheets, deal structures etc in an easy to understand fashion. The book has a conversational tone. It feels as though I've had a series of long dinners with the authors over which they imparted their key VC learnings. Highly recommended.",
    "Very practical, well articulated VC book to dive into the details of the industry and the process",
    "A fundamental book for those working in the VC industry and anyone involved in the fundraising process - from entrepreneurs to lawyers and accountants. I appreciated the mix of theoretical content (with some sample clauses from real-case term sheets) and insights derived from the experience of the authors. As VC investment terms become more and more standardized, it is very useful to know how it all evolved (from the dot-com to the unicorn bubble) and what is really relevant to customize in each deal.\n\nThe quality of the print edition is not excellent, though. Wiley should definitely improve it - the price is high enough I suppose.",
    "Me ha gustado mucho como cubre todos los aspectos del proceso de inversión en startups. Si conjugas este libro con otro de valoración creo que queda cubierta toda la parte teórica. Jejej luego queda lo mas difícil que es invertir",
    "Bought this book as its supposed to be the best reference book on VC funding, but the printing and paper quality is very bad....doesn't look like of international standard..hard to beleive."

    "The book was exactly as the description stated.",
    "Someone got hungry, damaged book.",
    "This is a detailed book about the varying degrees of leadership styles, and more importantly the style of followers who enable leaders. The changes in leadership styles are subtle, so it's easy to interpret the small differences as repetitive. This is a very useful body of knowledge. Boring? Absolutely. Helpful? Absolutely!",
    "My fiancé has benefited greatly from this book during his study",
    "I had to have this book for my summer class and despite my dread of having to read it in the first place, it gives some great examples, theories, and information about leadership. For college students, it may not be an interest unless mandatory for class but it taught me a lot about my own personal leadership styles and how I can work on more to be a better person and leader for the future. Try it out :)",
    "Starts with Trait Theory and works its way through the history of leadership theory since then. Gives a good overview of each theory, its application, strengths, and weaknesses. Well written and exhaustively sourced. Pretty much a staple for students of leadership.",
    "Purchased for an MBA Leadership course. Was actually pleasantly surprised by the content. I did not find it to be too overly academic. It was well organized, contained many different approaches to leadership and discussed strengths, applications, criticisms, and case studies with each approach. Several of the leadership approaches contained self-assessment tools or portions of tools used in practice, which were very informative. Would recommend.",
    "This reading is transformative .",
    "As a student, this is was a hurt my pocket. however, this is a useful book",
    "Good overview of recent literature on the major leadership theories.",
    "Analysis, statistics and in depth knowledge of leadership",
    "Useful book for university work",
    "Well written, describes main leadership traits and styles. Provides a lot of practical examples and academic citations."

    "Kesey was our neighbor when he lived in La Honda, yet I had never read any of his books. Although this book is a classic from the 1960’s Hippy era, it remains powerfully relevant today. It is a lesson in what it takes to live free in an oppressive society. Very highly recommended.",
    "Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" was one of the most powerful books I have ever read. Although the story takes place mainly in a mental hospital, its ramifications can be felt in all of the broader society. The struggles depicted in the various characters, both internally and inter-personally, will give the reader pause and perhaps change your perception on life.\n\nThe story at its core encompasses the struggle between the individual (portrayed by Randall McMurphy) and the establishment (Portrayed by nurse Ratched.) It is told through the eyes of the schizophrenic half-Indian known as Chief Bromden. Bromden has pretended to be deaf and dumb for so long that everyone takes this fact for granted. It also allows him to overhear comments from the staff that others would not. The Chief is an interesting choice as narrator, and at times it seemed like he was rambling on about nothing. Unreliable narrators can be a touchy thing, but Kesey is able to navigate his way through the Chief's mind, and in time we find his ramblings have a purpose. He views the establishment as a machine, which he refers to as \"the combine.\" He speaks of fog machines, wires in the walls, and robotic people, and views them as part of the combine. Even the name of the nurse, Ratched, sounds almost like \"ratchet,\" which is a common tool. The Chief sees the struggle between the Big Nurse, as he calls Ratched, and McMurphy, and even though he has a sense right away that McMurphy is different, Bromden doesn't hold out much hope. After all, the combine is a massive machine and the Chief knows what it did to him. Bromden tells McMurphy he \"used to be big,\" but not any more. The Chief's mother, a white woman from town, along with the government, broke down both he and his father and became bigger than both of them put together.\n\nThe antagonist is Ratched, an ex-army nurse who rules the ward with an iron fist. She preys on the weaknesses of the patients and attacks them in those areas. She is all about control and power, and over her long career has devised many ways of projecting this with a cold, machine-like efficiency. Ratched has hand picked her staff based on their cruelty and submissiveness. The Chief calls her \"The Big Nurse,\" which reminds me of Orwell's Big Brother, and mentions early on that \"The Big Nurse tends to get real put out if something keeps her outfit from running like a smooth, accurate, precision-made machine\" (pg 24). Indeed the Chief sees her as a machine, part of the combine who's purpose is to make others small. Ratched represents the oppressive nature and de-humanization present in modern society.\n\nAnd then there is Randle McMurphy. Sent to the ward from a work farm (because it's \"easier\" time), McMurphy comes in loud and confident. His singing and laughter are something new for the patients so used to suppressing their emotions. And he is definitely not the kind of patient the mechanical and repressive Nurse Ratched wants. It only takes McMurphy one group session to see Ratched's method of exposing the patient's weakest areas and pecking them into submission. Harding, the subject of the group meetings earlier frenzy, explains that it was all therapeutic. McMurphy, however, gives Harding his perception: \"what she is is a ball-cutter. I've seen a thousand of 'em...people who try to make you weak so they can get you to...live like they want you to. And the best way to do this...is to weaken you by gettin' you where it hurts the worst\" (pg 56). So McMurphy, ever the gambling man, makes a bet with his fellow patients that he would be able to make Ratched lose her composure, and he accomplished this by using her own tactics against her. As he pulls Bromden and the others out of the \"fog\" and makes them big again, McMurphy unwittingly becomes the savior of his fellow patients. It did not go un-noticed that the electroshock table was cross-shaped with the patient restrained by the wrists and feet and a \"crown\" placed over his head. When McMurphy rips Nurse Ratched's tightly starched uniform and exposes her breasts, he is symbolically exposing her hypocrisy and breaking the power she had once wielded over the patients. Chief Bromden's final act of mercy cemented Nurse Ratched's fall as well as giving McMurphy the dignity that he had earned.\n\nPerhaps the largest piece of advice I pulled from this novel is to never let anyone or anything take your individuality. Society in general would like to have everyone fit into the same mold because then the people are easier to predict and control. However, we all need a McMurphy in our lives to show us that we can still be individuals and fit into society. And when The Combine tries to weaken you and make you conform, just throw your head back and laugh like McMurphy, \"because he knows you have laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy\" (pg 233).",
    "I loved reading this book. Highly recommend. But this book physically is short and the words are hard to read. So you have to look very closely to see the words.",
    "A real page turner that's hard to put down once you start reading. I saw the classic Jack Nicholson movie adaptation decades ago, and to the detriment of the reading experience I had movie images in my mind as I read, and in hindsight wish I had been able to read the book first.",
    "This is an amazing book. I didn’t read this until I hit thirty; the reason for this being I thought less of it due to having seen the film. The film is not bad, but for me One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s nest was its film version, full stop. I eventually decided to read the book after learning about the interesting life its author Ken Kesey lived, including that he wrote much of this book while working at a mental hospital.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest deals with the relationship between freedom and power, and about how mental illness develops when the power of others dominates an individual to such a great extent that he/she can no longer act free. The individuals in the hospital are shown by Kesey to be lacking in courage and self-belief, and demonstrate an unwillingness to act without permission and approval. While the hospital should be making patients better it actually makes them worse by actively discouraging attempts to be assertive and by labelling any attempt to act free from the constraints of institutional power as symptomatic of a worsening of the underlying disorder.\n\nThe book is told through the eyes of Chief Bowden: a part Indian man that has spent a long time in the hospital pretending to be deaf and mute. Through the subjective experiences of the Chief, Kesey presents the actual experiences of mental illness. Kesey in doing this dismisses the notion that mental illness is unreal but reveals how its treatment is sometimes abused to keep people in line. Chief Bowden experiences things through metaphorical hallucinations. For example, when speaking of the power held by the Big Nurse, he literally sees wires running from her office into the bodies of those that she controls. This conception of mental illness is similar to that found in R.D Laing’s book the Divided Self: the mentally ill person is someone that cannot face the pain of reality and retreats into their own realm, but reality still intrudes via metaphorical representations.\n\nThroughout the novel Chief Bowden focuses on the power struggle taking place between Randle McMurphy and the Big Nurse. McMurphy is not in hospital voluntarily but has committed an offence which landed him on a work farm. He is transferred to the mental hospital partly of his own design to escape drudgery. McMurphy immediately emerges as a threat to the Big Nurse due to his willingness to question process and act without fear. He is not scared of authority and does not censor himself when confronted with the subtle shaming techniques of the Big Nurse.\n\nThe Big Nurse effectively runs the hospital. She is shown through the subjective eye of Chief Bowden to be solely concerned with maintaining her grip of power over the hospital. She is obsessed with process; she pretends to enforce process for the therapeutic value that the processes have on the patients, when in reality she loves the process because it is her process and provides her with a sense of security and power.\n\nThe interactions between McMurphy and Big Nurse question the extent to which people can be free. Sartre once argued that individuals are totally free so that even if facing the death penalty we are free to defy the executioners by mentally not accepting their interpretation of events and the descriptions placed on them. McMurphy is a Sartrean hero as he does not allow the views of others and the subtle attempts to shun and devalue him dictate how he behaves. However, as the book plays out Kesey demonstrates that living in this manner may not lead to a life of pleasure or fame but may involve the free person being crushed by power structures and processes that do not appreciate the questioning of where power lies.\n\nI would argue that One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s nest offers a modern presentation of the story found in the New Testament. Like Christ, McMurphy questions the powers of his time: in this case psychiatry and bureaucratic process rather than the Jewish religious leaders. Like Christ he questioned the intentions of the powers that be and acted as a free human rather than someone embarrassed by their true nature. Moreover, like Christ, McMurphy suffers at the hands of an authority that pretends to be in place for the concern of the many when in reality it gives power to the few, and in suffering on the Cross gives the weak a lasting sense of freedom.\n\nSee my other reviews at amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com",
    "I have always loved the movie of this book but have only just got around to reading it. In some ways the screen version has more emotional punch, particularly at the end, driven in part by Nicholson’s mesmerising performance. The book, however, is far more textured and layered - I was not expecting the richness of the Chief’s narrative: the echoes of a lost way of life and the powerful extended metaphor of a new way of life like some enormous machine or ‘combine’ controlling people. It has a romantic edge - a warning of the turning away from the land, a warning against institutional control. A beautiful book, elegiac in tone, one I will return to in the future to fully appreciate the scope of its vision.",
    "Understanding the title of this great novel gives us a clue to its compelling power. The cuckoo is the impostor, the rule breaker, the Darwinian survivor. He is the RP McMurphy, the RPM of the novel’s revving, subversive voice that challenges the relentless ratcheting up of institutionalised power in Nurse Ratched. The cuckoo sets the rules, but the one that flew over the nest neither resists nor accepts them. And there, in the figure of the narrator, Chief Bromden, the towering half-Indian who fakes his deafness and dumbness in order to get a fine scalpel-like view of the dehumanisation of men in a US asylum in the middle of the Cold War, the story speaks.\n\nIt’s a brilliant device, but Kesey thrusts Bromden into the limelight, exposing his vulnerabilities and survival strategies as the narrative evolves. He understands the layers of medicated soul-subjugation even as he submits to them. By never performing any final acts of surrender, the reader is able to watch the systematic deterioration of a therapised community through his calm, objective eyes. Bromden reflects on his past to the work of a hydro-electric dam in Oregon that destroyed his community, just as he sees the bureaucratised mechanisation of men’s minds within the asylum.\n\nKesey’s writing has a deep personal urgency inscribed into the suppressed instincts and passions of his characters. You feel throughout how the narrative edges towards crisis and catastrophe and, in McMurphy, his recklessness and bluff hilarity cause his downfall in the end. Kesey creates the sense of someone who has no place anywhere in American society and yet who represents someone who IS everywhere. That is something that the brutally mechanistic Nurse Ratched will never understand or accept. Kesey’s crowning achievement in this novel is his ability to show that the corporate insanity of government and CIA administration across the post-War decades was infinitely more injurious to the majority of its citizens than anything a lonely and frustrated woman trapped behind a fragile glass screen could ever hope to be.",
    "Can it really be 50 years since the publication of this book, I remember my first reading in the mid 70's and it has been a great pleasure, and a walk down memory lane, to once again make the acquaintance of the residents of an Oregon Psychiatric Hospital and in particular one Randle P McMurphy. Most people will remember the 1976 movie and the electric performance of Jack Nicholson as the audacious and colourful \"Mack\", in a movie that won many awards. The book has lost none of its magic even now reading the it so many years later, and the emotions that it can produce are still very real.\n\nMcMurphy is moved to the mental institution from a prison farm where he was serving a sentence for the rape of a 15 year old girl. Although he is not mentally ill, he is hoping to avoid hard labour and serve the rest of his sentence in a relaxed environment. The life of the rest of the inmates is now turned on its head as McMurphy proceeds to wreck havoc in an attempt to control and alter the mundane existence of lethargic and inactive inmates....\"We are lunatics from the hospital up the highway, psychoceramics, the cracked pots of mankind.\"....The only obstacle standing between Mack and his dreams is the formidable figure of the steely strict Nurse Ratched.....\"Her face is still calm, as though she had a cast made and painted to just the look she wants. Confident, patient, and unruffled.\"...\n\nThe story is told in the first person through the eyes of one long term resident Chief Bromden a tall native American believed to be deaf and mute. Through a series of minor misdemeanours and coercion McMurphy is hoping to breakdown the stranglehold of power that Nurse Rached holds over the inmates, who are dulled and kept under control by the constant and daily consumption of medication. It would therefore appear that the prime function of the institution is to manage, by this use of drugs, the minds and temperaments of the residents, rather than try to rehabilitate them and reintroducing them back into society where they might once again make a useful contribution. If the use of drugs and stimulants fails to pacify the disturbed mind the institution is willing to apply electroshock therapy and in the most severe cases a lobotomy is performed.\n\nThis is a book fully entrenched in the methods and institutions of its time. It is also a story of power and authority, those who wheel it and those who would attempt to question it by any means possible. It is a wonderful and colourful narration, strong and memorable characters, essentially funny yet ultimately sad. To me Randle P McMurphy is more than a comic figure, he chooses to question the reality and sense of his surroundings and by doing so set himself on the road to confrontation with the soulless Nurse Ratched and ultimately there can only be one winner, and an ending that is both shocking and captivating. Highly Recommended.",
    "I had to think about things for a long time before I got round to deciding how to rate this book. There were moments while reading that I felt like it was a true masterpiece, and there were moments that I felt uninterested and quite confused. I have actually seen both the film and the play (both of which I loved) in action before reading, so I already had a very clear idea of how the story played out, but I don't think my feelings would be different if I was coming into reading the book with fresh eyes. Randle Patrick McMurphy was such a character and despite his obviously devilish, sneaky ways I fell for him as soon as he entered the book. Meanwhile, Nurse Ratched is probably one of the most terrifying villains I've ever come across in a book and I'm finding it tough to imagine any character ever beating her in this. Her calm, icy demeanour played off against McMurphy's fiery, quick-thinking personality perfectly and I adored watching them try to outsmart each other. These two were an example of perfect characterisation and I thought it particularly meaningful that the 'hero' was a conniving petty criminal, and the villain a supposedly charitable nurse who dedicates her life to 'helping' people. Chief Bromden was an interesting character but I wish less time had been dedicated to his slightly bizarre thoughts/memories and he'd had a little more to do. Kesey wrote well enough and built his world spectacularly also, but I'm afraid to say the overall message didn't wash so well with me. There is a lot of very racist, misogynistic language to be found in this novel and it has a very clearly symbolised anti-feminist tone that also conveyed a lot of hatred towards society as a whole. A lot of this was left out of the aforementioned film and play and so I didn't realise quite what I was getting myself into until I started reading. Although I think this book was cleverly written and did bring some brilliant moments to the table, it lost itself in the message it was trying to convey.",
    "I bought a brand new copy so the condition was absolutely fine, unlike many of the negative reviews here which seem to be based on the condition of the book or the grammar.\nI read the introduction and then got twenty paged into the actual story before deciding to give up, I don't know exactly how to describe the way the book is written but I find it pretty much impossible to read. Reading should be a pleasure and keep you engaged, this book is neither and is an effort and a chore to read. The movie was great, I would advise anybody to simply watch the movie rather than attempt to read this book."

    "I believe Joe is the most practical and down to earth trainer. I have read and watched many trainers/ authors that will tell you a particular motion or action means this or that. That isn't true! Joe teaches you to remain objective with your mind wide open. Lots of things people do can mean many things based on, the day they are having, external circumstances, stresses,etc. A person's actions are only clues to the truth. Collect enough clues and the percentage your are on track increases. To find the \"truth\", keep your ego and bias out. Ask the right good quality open ended questions and you'll collect enough data so you will be 95%+/- accurate in due time. Like a recipe don't under cook what you do as the end result will be effected. Remember their can always be errors so be your own devils advocate meaning: .What other possibilities did you totally miss by accident, forget, overlooked, or yet to be discovered? Ideally you want a confession so the story comes out minus what they don't tell you or fib about. Remember everyone lies, omits information and/or exaggerates daily. There is a true professional art to do this. Joe is a true artist! Read his background. Learn the art with the Master. You learn that mistakes can be costly to all, like your relationships with friends, spouses, co-workers, boss, etc. Don't rush to diagnose everyone and your relationships. If your too close its hard to be objective. Be smart with what you learn. I only skimmed the surface here. Joe is an ocean of knowledge! The ocean expansive. Dive in! You have the best dive coach. He teaches you what to and what not to do. I have read and listened to this book more than once. I wanted to gain \"Emotional Intelligence\" (another great book). I did this so I can see the forest, the trees, see the forest from above, see the pitfalls, understand where best to walk, and see the best way I can use this information to improve my sales success, personal success, relationships, and help others.

    "What problem does this book attempt to address?\nMost of us spend our days not paying more attention to our environment than we must. This leads us to miss much of what is going on in our environment, especially nonverbal communication from others. The book lays out a complete guide for learning how to read this nonverbal communication and how it applies in various situations.\n\nContent\n• Concept explanation: Excellent\n• Related stories: Many\n• Data references and studies: Many\n• Charts and graphics: Many\n• Practical application: Very Strong\n\nThe concepts in this book are laid out in a direct and easy-to-understand way. Each chapter contains are numerous anecdotes that explored how the concept has been used in real-world situations. The graphics correlate with each nonverbal communication written explanation. He also backs up his claims with research and references. In the introduction, he says he worked with a research psychologist to verify all the data he uses. Overall, the combination of all these factors makes the book extremely effective at achieving the goal teaching how to asses non-verbal communication.\n\nWriting style & presentation\n• Tone: Conversational\n• Organization: Excellent\n• Flow: Adequate\n\nWhile the conversational tone of the book makes it interesting to read and the stories intertwined in each section is engaging, there is a lot of material covered in this book. For someone who is truly attempting to learn and improve these skills reading this book straight through is probably not a good idea. The organization of each section is necessarily repetitive in order to lay out all the information effectively. The content is not repetitive but the format is, which can make it more challenging to not start skimming through the later sections.\n\nBringing It All Together\nOne thing done very well in this book is the exceptional explanation of each nonverbal behavior. New terms are both defined and shown through relatable examples that someone who is new to reading body language would recognize (such as a child slumping their shoulders when they feel guilty). Then Navarro demonstrates how it applies in high-stakes situations including criminals, board rooms, and relationships. The graphics are quite useful and listening in audio format without the graphics would take away from the learning process.\n\nOne main thing I took away from this book was that the body is more honest than words. Learning to recognize and understand the full scope of nonverbal cues benefits in all aspects of life.\n\nFavorite Quote\n“When it comes to seeing the silent language of nonverbal behavior, many viewers might as well be wearing blindfolds, as oblivious as they are to the body signals around them.”\n\nOverall Recommendation\n- Overall recommendation: 5/5\n- Who I would recommend this book for: Someone interested in practicing and developing the techniques of reading nonverbal communication.\n- Who I wouldn’t recommend this book for: Someone looking for a light, quick, feel-good read.",
    "This is one of those books which is quite hard to rate. But here we go.\n\nTarget Audience\nThis is a beginners' book. So if you are already a whiz at reading body language, or you are a psychology graduate, this is not the book for you. It's the pop-science/pop-psychology version, aimed at the ordinary man-in-the-street who wants to know about more about the subject, to be better able to read friends, family, colleagues, and so on. If you want something more complex than that - if you want a high-level textbook or an academic thesis - this is not the book for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are an ordinary person wanting to know a bit more about body language, this is a good place to start.\n\nEqually, I think this would be a good book for writers who want to write realistic body language - there's a difference between being able to read body language instinctively, and having it laid out exactly what you're looking at, and the types of things people do when they're comfortable/not comfortable, so that you can then reproduce it.\n\nThe Style\nNavarro might have interesting information to impart, but his delivery tends to be a little flat. This is not the kind of narrative non-fiction pop-science book that pulls you along with the sheer sparkiness of the prose. Get used to that, suck it up, and read the information. This is the boiled cauliflower of prose: good for you, but bland.\n\nThe Content\nUnlike some reviewers, I am not naturally gifted with a brilliant ability to interpret other people's body language. Nor am I a psychology graduate. However, the content seemed to me to be accurate. When I replay what I've seen in my head, it matches up with what Navarro is saying. Furthermore, Navarro is very clear that body language tends to indicate comfort/discomfort - what that means is something you have to interpret in context. There is no 'tell' that will infallibly indicate when someone is lying.\n\nThe Conclusion\nFour stars for content, provided you're in the right target audience. Delivery could have been better, but not everything in life is fun and exciting. A useful book for those who want to know a little more on the subject for general-purpose use.",
    "This book was recommended to me by a psychologist I went on a date with. On the first date he was able to tell me things about what I was thinking and how I was feeling about him just by my body language.\n\nHe told me he felt I did not like him along with other things and I was amazed how he could know these things about me just by meeting me. So I asked him how he knew and he recommended this book, and I bought it as soon as I got home from the date. I never saw him again but i read the book and it is definitely worth reading if you want to learn how to speed read people.\n\nThe product also seems to be reasonably price and the writing style of the author makes the book both enjoyable and easy to read.",

I didn't wait long to realise that this book, for me at least, gave me confidence in my every day interactions and I have even gone on to change my thought process when in certain social circumstances.\n\nI recommend this great book to anyone looking to gain that extra confidence and gift you the knowledge to be a step ahead in many day to day situations.",
    "Not a bad book but a lot of repetition of the same basic stuff. The start of each chapter basically says the same thing.\nIf you've ever read books about body language before, you probably know what's in this book already. Nothing unusual or surprising is revealed by this FBI guy."

    "*Spoiler Alert* - You may want to put your highlighter away for this reading book journey. Trust and Inspire has so many pearls of wisdom for leadership at work, at home, in your community and in your life as a whole with every turn of the page that you would have to highlight everything!\n\nThis week I completed reading Trust & and Inspire from cover to cover. I was so excited to receive this much anticipated copy and I must say it was worth the wait. The care, authenticity and concern poured throughout each page in this book not only for leaders within companies and organizations, but for the betterment of our global society as a whole is remarkable.\n\nBreaking from the mold (dare I say default leadership mantra) of Command & Control culture of leadership to the Trust and Inspire model of leadership at the company and individual level is not a trivial undertaking. Stephen M.R. Covey and his team tackle the most daunting aspects of achieving success in this model by outlining what it means to be a leadership steward - modeling, trusting and inspiring.\n\nMany books have been written on the traits of a great leader or the emotional intelligence required to become an awesome leader, but very few have been so eloquently written which provides the level of powerful real life storytelling and business outcomes from across industries which we can all relate to. As Mr. Covey shared his lived experiences and lessons learned from his parents, as well as how that profoundly impacted his approach with his children, I found myself fully engaged with each chapter. For me personally, Trust and Inspire has re-grounded my belief that knowing who you are, having a set of core values which guides your leadership and impact on people, while focusing on the greater good of society is what the world needs to remember right now.\n\nThe book's foundational theme of trust and inspiration, the relevant quotes from recognized leaders from around the world, coupled with the contrast/comparison tables between the Command & Control style vs. the Trust & Inspire model interspersed throughout the book, really allows for clear roadmap of how to improve the way in which you can transform your leadership with purpose. Remember that to become a Trust & Inspire Leader it always starts with you. I will share this small excerpt from Trust and Inspire with you (hopefully I don't get in trouble here):\n\n\"To serve others and care for their well-being -- even if doing so doesn't appear to benefit us in any way -- is perhaps the highest form of humanity. Interestingly it also happens to produce better outcomes. Leadership is stewardship, and leaders are stewards.\"\n\nRegardless of your industry, your job function or your current situation, I highly recommend Trust & Inspire as one of those books that will have a profound impact on your life, the life of your family, your friends and your colleagues, if you embrace and apply the wisdom which this book imparts.\n\nHappy reading!",
    "Amazing book! Delivered well & in perfect shape!",
    "Reading „Speed Trust“ It did not speak to me, because something were missing. We start our Speed Trust journey, but somehow stopped in the halfway. Some guidelines would be worth to developed. Now reading “Trust & Inspire” all puzzle pieces are going to be in place. Your team/organization/family will develop with amazing speed and all parties are more than happy. And very important all parties feel others trust and this has huge power and enlarge horizon.\nNext question is to implement in your organization there is majority managed Command and Control style. You can bring camel by the water, but you cannot force it to drink. It will take time, but you should never give up.\nI recommend to not only read, but to implement and you will see results. You can start at home and believe me you will see results faster than you can imagine.",
    "This will change the world, starting with me. I just bought several more copies to share with my leadership team at work. This book is to Leadership Development what 7 Habits is to personal effectiveness. It encapsulates so many principles and timeless truths about how we treat people, and what different philosophies and mindsets will undoubtedly lead to. It applies to business, family, friends, direct and indirect leadership, you name it.\n\nThe book doesn’t just review all of this great “what”, but it also dives deeply into the “how. I had no idea how much “my style is getting in the way of my intent”. There are countless examples of today’s top leaders doing things right, in ways that have been less than mainstream. It shows in no uncertain terms the success of doings what’s right in any association or relationship. I appreciated that it used not just professional examples, but also many personal ones, with insights and applications that guide ALL aspects of life.\n\nThank you David, Stephen, McKinley, Gary and everyone at the FranklinCovey Leadership team for your efforts that went into this. Today, the world has an amazing new tool to change for the better starting with every person who reads and models the principles in this book!",
    "I first saw Stephen MR Covey being interviewed for community of SEVEN's Live Podcast and was inspired by his viewpoint on trust and inspire leadership. This is a must-read book for anyone in leadership or anyone who inspires to lead. This is a natural continuation of his best-selling book The Speed of Trust. What I appreciate about Trust and Inspire is that it gives specific exercises and examples that can be applied in the workforce. He goes on further to discuss the barriers which I found helpful. In this book, he illustrates that engagement is no longer enough. The world has changed and our leadership has to change. People don't want to be managed, they want to be inspired and trusted. Amen to this! But this book now. It's worth every penny!",
    "Trust and Inspire is the leadership style that has worked for me in turning companies around all over the world. Stephen Covey is a master teacher explaining the new leadership style better than i have seen. A must read for all leaders of families, companies and any organization.",
    "Stephen provided a structure to the concepts that I felt I knew but wasn't able to put them together. The strucured way of thinking provided me greater insights to the concepts of Trust & Inspire.",
    "Even better than the Author's previous book on this topic: \"The Speed of Trust\""

    "The main premise of this book is best summarized by the author in the first chapter of the book: \"The traditional selling models, methods, and techniques that most of us have been trained to use work best in small sales. In this book I'll be showing you that what works in small sales can hurt your success as the sales grow larger--and I'll be sharing with you our research findings that have uncovered new and better models for success in large sales...One of the simplest models of a sales call does seem to be applicable to any size of sale; almost every sales call you can think of, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, goes through four distinct stages 1. Preliminaries: These are the warming-up events that occur before the serious selling begins...2. Investigating: Almost every sale involves finding something out by asking questions...3. Demonstrating Capability: In most calls you will need to demonstrate to customers that you've something worthwhile to offer...4. Obtaining Commitment: Finally, a successful sales call will end with some sort of commitment from the customer...We decided that the focus of our research would be to develop new and positive questioning models that could replace the old ones, which were proving so unsatisfactory...We found that questions in the successful call tend to fall into a sequence we call SPIN. In summary the SPIN sequence of questions is: 1) Situation Questions: At the start of the call, successful people tend to ask data-gathering questions about facts and background.... 2) Problem Questions: Once sufficient information has been established about the buyer's situation, successful people tend to move to a second type of question... 3) Implication Questions: In smaller sales, sellers can be very successful if they just know how to ask good Situation and Problem Question...4) Need-payoff Questions:Finally, we found that very successful salespeople ask a fourth type of question during the Investigating stage... is that they get the customer to tell you the benefits that your solution could offer.\"\n\nBelow are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:\n\n1- \"The psychological effect of pressure seems to be this. If I'm asking you to make a very small decision, then--if I pressure you--it's easier for you to say yes than to have an argument. Consequently, with a small decision, the effect of pressure is positive. But this isn't so with large decisions. The bigger the decision, the more negatively people generally react to pressure.\"\n\n2- \"By forcing the customer into a decision, closing techniques speed the sales transaction...Closing techniques may increase the chances of making a sale with low-priced products. With expensive products or services, they reduce the chances of making a sale.\"\n\n3- \"The first step in successful closing is to set the right objectives. The starting point for obtaining a commitment is to know what level of commitment from the customer will be needed to make the call a success.\"\n\n4- \"So what's the test of closing success? What's the result, or outcome, that allows us to say that one call has been successful while another has failed? The method we finally chose involved dividing the possible outcomes of the call into four areas: 1)Orders: Where the customer makes a firm commitment to buy... 2)Advances: Where an event takes place, either in the call or after it, that moves the sale forward toward a decision... 3)Continuations: Where the sale will continue but where no specific action has been agreed upon by the customer to move it forward...4)No-sales: Our final category is where the customer actively refuses a commitment.\"\n\n5- \"Obtaining Commitment: Four Successful Actions 1. Giving attention to Investigating and Demonstrating Capability...2. Checking that key concerns are covered..3. Summarizing the Benefits... 4.Proposing a commitment\"\n\n6- \"The purpose of questions in the larger sale is to uncover Implied Needs and to develop them into Explicit Needs.\"\n\n7- \"Demonstrating Capability Effectively: 1.Don't demonstrate capabilities too early in the call...2. Beware Advantages...3. Be careful with new products.\"\n\n8- \"Making Your Preliminaries Effective: 1. Get down to business quickly...2. Don't talk about solutions too soon...3. Concentrate on questions.\"\n\n9- \"The Four Golden Rules for Learning Skills Rule 1: Practice Only One Behavior at a Time Start by picking just one behavior to practice...Don't move on to the next until you're confident you've got the first behavior right.... Rule 2: Try the New Behavior at Least Three Times...Never judge whether a new behavior is effective until you've tried it at least three times...Rule 3: Quantity Before Quality...When you're practicing, concentrate on quantity: use a lot of the new behavior. Don't worry about quality issues, such as whether you're using it smoothly or whether there might be a better way to phrase it. Those things get in the way of effective skills learning. Use the new behavior often enough and the quality will look after itself...Rule 4: Practice in Safe Situations...Always try out new behaviors in safe situations until they feel comfortable. Don't use important sales to practice new skills.\"\n\n10- \"The most important lessons come from the way you review the calls you make. After each call, ask yourself such questions as these: Did I achieve my objectives? If I were making the call again, what would I do differently? What have I learned that will influence future calls on this account? What have I learned that I can use elsewhere?\"",
    "The book is amazing and presented in a manner that is very conducive to learning. I am in a service industry (law) and the lessons are just as important as others readers confirm they are in sales. It almost makes me want to switch professions.",
    "I feel like 99% of self-help books, be it self-help in work, love, friendships, what have you, are useless. They always have fluff chapters of 'act motivated and be motivated!' or 'think like a winner!' and various platitudes of that nature. You wind up finishing the book and realizing you read nothing but pseudo-motivational dribble that will wind up having zero impact on whatever you were looking to improve upon.\n\nEnter 'SPIN Selling' - this book delivers where all of those other books have failed. In this book is a solid layout of how you should structure your sales calls, and not only that, but data to back up their claims and examples to on how to lead. Read this book, take notes, and I guarantee if you weren't already aware of how to sell in this style, your selling WILL improve.\n\nI'm a novice to sales. Last year when I was interviewing for a sales position I was asked to put together a sales presentation and to sell a product. I was given the product brochure and 1 day to come up with something. Using 'SPIN Selling' as my guide, I put together a list of ideas and pitched them in my presentation. My interviewer was blown away. After I got the job, my manager told me he had never had someone deliver such a good presentation - everyone always focuses on selling the product, but they never try and sell the customer. Taking a note from this book, I asked the questions I needed to ask, developed them into problems for the buyer, and then walked them through the solution with their own words. It was a total and complete win.\n\nI was tempted to give this book 4 stars because it really does falter in a few areas. For one, some of the research is tenuous at best - <100 sales calls that they then base their report on. That's frankly not enough data to prove or disprove anything.\n\nSecondly, this book is very weak on opening/closing a sale, which are both obviously rather important. The book mentions briefly what you shouldn't do to open a call, but doesn't really expand on good ways to introduce yourself. Even worse, it has a whole chapter on closing, but doesn't give you specific advice on what to do! It gives you a whole lot of data on why you shouldn't constantly close, why the worst sellers are always trying to close, how it annoys customers, etc. It never actually says 'Here is the best way we found to bring a sale to the next level: A/B/C\". It kind of boggles the mind because the book even shows a study where sales that had no closers in them had something like 20% the success rate - obviously a close is necessary, but the book skimps a bit on that aspect. I couldn't bring myself to give it less than 5 stars because the meat of the book is just so good.",
    "These CDs offer new (at least to someone with very little sales experience like myself) ideas for each stage of the selling process. The investigation stage gets the largest amount of attention. The biggest strength of the text is that it is research based. This makes it really convincing.\n\nThe CDs are really well structured, I listened to them in my car and had no difficulties of understanding everything and remembered most of it easily.\n\nThere was a section on learning skills as opposed to learning knowledge, which I found very interesting and useful.\n\nOn the improvement side, there could have been a few more examples of sales behaviours. Adding a few more CDs to the package wouldn't reduce the overall quality.\n\nAll in all, a great purchase for someone who is looking for an alternative to the classic sales ABC (always be closing) approach.",
    "spin selling is the best book out there to help you become better at selling. it's a simple methodology to help the seller get more out of their conversations; through asking decent questions which ultimately helps with qualification. if you are struggling in sales/or are new to selling and finding the job fustrating (which everyone goes through by the way) then this book will definetely put you in the right direction.",
    "Interesting approach to sales and works a treat. I do feel, however, that this could have been done using less words, chapters, pages and paper.",
    "Helpful book introducing the SPIN. Easily read in an afternoon - some valuable points extracted.",
    "Having travelled halfway around the globe and back it finally arrived and was well worth waiting for a very rare Hardback version.\n\nSeller gave plenty of communication.\n\nHighly recommended."

    "It was great and new considering I bought it used.",
    "I am a big Jon Gordon fan and from all the 5 star reviews, I’m obviously not alone. This is my first introduction to Damon West but plan on learning more of his story.\n\nThe book has a simple message and is written with a framework easy to understand. The message could have been much more impactful if the authors would have spent more time on delving into the message. For example, they should of examined how to withstand the heat or pressure to conform. What builds the principles that are foundational to a life of character that empowers one to live with the resolve exemplified in the coffee bean would have been welcomed content. Instead it’s a 50K foot level analysis of a face to face reality.\n\nNow if you think my criticism is too harsh please allow me to state my personal opinion that may give more insight into what is shaping my perspective.\n\nFirst, I am a Jon Gordon fan and have been long before he “made it big.” I have enjoyed every book (of course some more than others) and I have purchased hundreds of his books to give to teams I managed and the company where I was the CEO. I state this so that you know I’m not giving criticism for the sake of criticism. I’m a fan, continue to be a fan and think highly of him.\n\nSecond, Jon Gordon is a brand. No different than Coca Cola or your favorite NFL player. A book by Jon has a certain expectation of quality. It took Jon a tremendous amount of work to get there but it wouldn’t take nearly as long to lose that expectation.\n\nThird, this book cost me $15 and my “expectation of quality” was that I was getting a book written at the same level as all his others. I must admit that although this had the potential of good messaging, at times I felt silly reading this book due to feeling as if it was written for a 3rd grader.\n\nFourth, this is not a “book” and would have been better presented as a blog post or article. It certainly is not worth more than $2.99 on Kindle. It had the chance to be a book with more commitment to extrapolation of the message but I feel I get no sense of commitment to the subject in the authors voice. No sense of research or macro concern for the subject matter. It almost was if someone heard a story (the coffee bean), found a brand to communicate that story (Jon Gordon) and wanted to make a fast dollar and put the story out as a “Jon Gordon Book.”\n\nFifth, based on what I state above there is part of me that felt taken advantage of as a fan. I’m not intending to be dramatic, but whenever you hold a high regard for a brand there is an expectation to what that brand delivers. For example, you assume a Mercedes Benz has leather interior and a quality engine. You assume a Chicago Style pizza means it comes with thick crust and not paper thin. I hold Jon Gordon’s name as an author to represent a certain quality and if this isn’t of that same quality than certainly don’t be shy in telling me or making sure I understand. However, this book is in the same price range as The Energy Bus and is nowhere near the quality. I will not purchase a Jon Gordon book as trusting in future.\n\nIf you think I’m too harsh or too dramatic ask yourself a question or two. Who spent more time on this book, the authors or the illustrator? Did this book require two authors? Is it at all possible one of those “authors” was simply capitalizing on his fan base?\n\nIn summary, this is all just my opinion and again as someone who is a fan I would be lying if I just said all the warm and fuzzies and gave 5 stars. However, I think too highly of Jon’s work to rate it the same as his previous books and believe this endeavor took advantage of the respect given to him by fans like me.",
    "My college son and I are sharing podcasts and books this summer and chatting about them on a weeklyish basis. I chose the Coffee Bean last week and he was a bit concerned that it would take too long to read the book. I rolled my eyes and told him to open it. \"Just do it. We can talk in 3 days.\" I said. Well, he came down for breakfast the next day and said he had finished the book and felt silly about complaining that it would take too long. The message is efficiently presented and very easy to read. Just what every 20 year old looks for in a book!\n\nWe had our discussion and chatted about the concepts of the book. I think it will be nice to be able to remind my son to \"Be the Bean\" and know that he will understand my encouragement. I have another 18 year old son who is away from home this summer and his brother suggested that I needed to get him to read the book as well. I loved that he saw value in the message and wanted to share it even further.\n\nI am a substitute teacher and have plans to keep this little book in my sub bag. I usually sub in high school and the speed which a student could read this book lends itself perfectly to handling a \"bored\" teenager and presenting what should be a positive message in a succinct manner. Next time a student asks to get on his/her phone because they are bored or done with the lesson I'm gonna hand them The Coffee Bean book!",

    "I was attracted to this book because… I enjoy Jon Gordon’s work. He always encourages me.\n\nThis book was about A simple illustration of how a coffee bean could make a difference in someone’s life with the right direction. It is also a reminder you can make important illustrations with the everyday items around you. If you are watching for them.\n\nThings I liked about this book How simple motivation can be shown in illustrations. This is a great tool to add to your inspirational toolbox. I was encouraged by how the images appeared in the electronic version.\n\nWhy you should read this book If you are stuck in place and need something to pick you and get you back on the path, this book is for you. If you are in a position to influence people, this is a great inspiration. If your associates don’t want to ride a bus for a month, perhaps they would accept a coffee bean.\n\nThis book lived up to the back cover copy I read the electronic version.",
    "Well written. The concept of the short story is very good, and relates to all ages, but I did feel the writing itself was leaning more to that of a child comprehendion than that of an adult.

    "The good news about The Challenger Sale is that Dixon and Adamson further the concept of consultative selling. Even better, in my estimation, is that the authors seemed to use some solid data on which to base their theories. I like some of their approach such as, “Lead to your solution not with your solution,” and “Differentiate yourself by showing your customer something new about their industry that they didn't know or provide them with a different view.” I believe the authors also get it right when they state, “In this world of dramatically changing customer buying behavior and rapidly diverging sales talent, your sales approach must evolve or you will be left behind.”\n\nHowever, they missed an opportunity to move complex sales to the next level. By complex sales, I mean to segregate commodity sales from the intangible products and services that require trust. And by the next level, I mean a salesperson who authentically has the customer’s best interest at heart and not just their own.\n\nThe subtitle of this book is “Taking control of the customer conversation.” As though to inoculate themselves from criticism, the authors state that they know some people will interpret this statement as being “arrogant” while stating that it isn't. They also speak about “educating the customer” and recognize that the same interpretation may be made about that point as well. Indeed, this reader believes that the mindset of a salesperson who takes it upon themselves to control the conversation and educate the customer/client is absolutely being arrogant. The authors seem to give short shrift to the human capacity to sense when they are being talked down to or manipulated. While you may be able to fool some of the people some of the time, most customers will sense when they are being manipulated.\n\nMany consumers today are, for the most part, immune or at least becoming immune to advertising and sales tactics that are focused on achieving the salesperson’s goals. They are skeptical. They listen to their friends and associates and depend on organic search results (not paid results) when researching a purchase. Product, solution and consultative selling (which includes Challenger Sales) are all still focused on gaining the salesperson’s goal of selling a product. Yet, between all the self-serving tactics and training, this book does provide some nuggets of insight for the alert reader.\n\nThe authors have defined two categories of sales people, core performers and high performers as well as five major “salesperson profiles”: The Hard Worker, The Challenger, The Relationship Builder, The Lone Wolf and The Reactive Problem Solver. In their research, the authors found that The Challenger was the person who continued to make sales quotas even through tough times like the 2008 recession. “The Challengers are the debaters on the team” and have a deep understanding of the customer’s industry. [Debate: to engage in argument by discussing opposing views.] They took control of the conversation, challenged the customer’s thinking and differentiated themselves by educated the customer on things about their industry/customers that were new to the customer. The Hard Workers are just that, they show up early, stay late and are persistent. The Relationship Builder is an unfortunate profile title. A better profile title would be “The Appeaser.” In this profile, the salesperson believes the relationship is the most important aspect of their job and will do nothing to jeopardize that customer relationship. They appease the customer at any cost – including the cost of losing a sale. The Lone Wolf is the prima donna of the salesforce. They do things their way, AND, they are high performers despite being difficult if not impossible to manage. The Reactive Problem Solver is focused like a laser on solving the customer’s problem. They will sacrifice spending time generating new sales as soon as an existing customer calls with an issue or new problem.\n\nAccording to the data presented by the authors, The Challengers are by far the best salespeople in terms of results with 39% of that profile in the “High Performer” category. The Lone Wolf (25%), Hard Worker (17%), Problem Solver (12%) and Relationship Builders (7%) profiles follow in order.\n\nA clearer and, in my opinion, better model for the “new” consumer driven market is that outlined by Patrick Lencione in his book Getting Naked and Charles Green in his book, Trust Based Selling. In both of those books, the authors make it clear that the proper mindset for sales is to authentically have the customer’s best interest at heart, not just the salesperson’s best interest. Any model that incites a mindset or intention that is designed to sell rather than to let the consumer buy will eventually be a roadblock to success.\n\nIn my opinion, a closer reading of the data and parsing of the survey results will show that the so called Challenger Salesperson is someone who first builds a trusting relationship by demonstrating that they have the customer’s best interest at heart, not just their own, and then help their customer better serve the end customers. They earn the right to share insights rather than simply build credibility from a position authority. They share rather than sell, tell or educate. They listen more rather than debate. They recognize that by representing a specific company with a specific set of products and services that they are already suspected of having a self-serving and highly biased point of view. Anything they say is suspect the same way that paid results in a Google search are suspect. They work hard to gain trust to offset the natural skepticism.\n\nIf we take the author’s research and survey results to the logical conclusion and combine that with how consumers are skeptical of large companies and “vested interests,” we would wind up with the best salespeople being independent consultants and manufacturer’s representatives rather than our own direct sales employees. Our products or services would be employed only by the customers who would truly be best served by using them as determined by someone who had nothing to gain by selling one manufacturer or consulting service over another. That is, presumably, how large complex ERP systems are sold – independent consultants and the customer review the large complex software offerings, determine the most suitable fit and the selection is made by the customer with only “arm’s length” influence by the software vendor. We would be forced to recognize that the “new customer” (i.e. the consulting firm) is as knowledgeable as or perhaps even more knowledgeable than we are. We would definitely change our approach to be more based on trust and competency.\n\nWords are important and will establish a mindset in those who are listening. The authors have chosen words that will create aggression rather than assertiveness, being didactic rather than sharing information and focusing on the salesperson rather than on the customer. It is unfortunate since the authors are exactly correct that “In this world of dramatically changing customer buying behavior and rapidly diverging sales talent, your sales approach must evolve or you will be left behind.” Sadly, their prescription will result in more of the same salesperson focused tactics. Ironically, if you want to sell more you have to stop selling. Instead, build trust, demonstrate competence, be dependable and always authentically have your customers best interest at heart, not just your own.",
    "This book comes very highly touted, especially by Neil Rackham himself, who calls it \"the most important advance in selling for many years.\"I personally don't think it reaches quite that level, but overall it is an excellent book, with provocative insights and useful information for salespeople looking for ways to break out of the pack.\n\nThe key to a really good book is that it makes you say, \"I never thought of that before,\" and to use that insight to improve your life in some way. Interestingly, that's also the key to a really good salesperson, as well.\n\nThe book is based on extensive research by the Sales Executive Council into the attributes of successful sales professionals. They found that salespeople tend to cluster into five different types, based on their behaviors: Hard Workers, Challengers, Relationship Builders, Lone Wolves, and Reactive Problem Solvers. Research is great when it generates new and unexpected insights, and three are central to the book.\n\nKey insight #1: Salespeople matter--a lot!\n\nOne of the surprising insights generated by their research was that the Sales Experience accounted for 53% of the contribution to customer loyalty, more than company and brand impact, product and service delivery, and value-to-price ratio combined! In other words, the latter three are just tickets to be able to play; how you sell is more important than what you sell. In complex solution sales, star performers outperform core performers by 200%, as opposed to 59% in transactional selling, so it's a critical insight.\n\nIf how you sell is so important, the next critical insight is about what the most effective reps out of the 6,000 that they surveyed do differently.\n\nKey insight #2: They don't care how much you care until they know how much you know\n\nOf the five types, relationship builders are the least effective performers. The old saying, \"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care,\" is better said, \"they don't care how much you care until they know how much you know.\" Relationships are important, but they are the result of successful selling and not the cause (as Rackham says in the Foreword).\n\nIn other words, what customers value most today is a rep who teaches them something, who challenges their insights and their view of the world. These reps are the Challengers and they comprise the largest component of top performers. Unlike relationship builders who focus on resolving tension and keeping everyone happy, challengers like to produce constructive tension, because major sales are about creating change and change generally requires discomfort.\n\nThe key is not in discovering the customer's needs and being able to express them, it's in being able to create the need that they didn't even have by getting them to look at their world in a way they had not before. As they say, if your customer's reaction to your pitch is, \"That's exactly what's keeping me up at night. You really understand our needs\", you've actually failed. What you want them to say is, \"Huh, I never thought of it that way before.\"\n\nOf course, if you do this and then they go ahead and solve their problem with a cheaper competitor, all you've done is sold for someone else. So, the other critical piece is to answer the most important question: \"Why should our customers buy from us over all competitors?\" This question is surprisingly difficult for reps to answer, as I personally have observed in my own training classes. But, with enough thinking and refining, you can answer the question. The thought process then becomes:\n\n* What are our strengths?\n* How do those strengths give the customer the capability to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity they don't know they have?\n* What do we need to teach the customer so they will value that capability?\n\nAs the book says, \"The sweet spot of customer loyalty is outperforming your competitors on those things you've taught your customers are important.\"\nIn order to achieve this sweet spot, Challengers do three things very well: teach, tailor, and take control. The middle section of the book explains how to build the teaching conversation, tailor your strengths to individual stakeholders, and take control of the sale. The teaching phase is the most expensive part of the book and appropriately enough, by far the most insightful and most innovative. Just this part of the book would make it worthwhile.\n\nKey insight #3: Focus on the core 60%\n\nThe final two chapters focus on how to implement the approach in the sales organization. Here their most important insight is that the focus should be on equipping the 60% of the sales force who are core performers to be able to follow the Challenger Selling model. The top 20% won't need it, and the bottom 20% won't get it.\nThe only quibble I have with The Challenger Sale is that many ideas which are relatively well-known already are treated as if they are startling new discoveries. I read some of the passages with the same irritation that Native Americans must feel when told Columbus \"discovered\" America. For example, they introduce the idea of tailoring your insight to the specific individual needs of the different stakeholders, which all good sales methodologies have incorporated for years. (In fairness, though, so many of these ideas that are common knowledge are still not common practice.)\n\nI would strongly recommend this book to sales executives, sales managers, and most of all, to sales professionals; I challenge you to read it and apply it.",
    "If you have been in sales for more than 3-4 years, especially Field Sales, then this SHOULD really have nothing new to teach you.\nThis book is based on research by people who are analyst's and never been in sales, and it shows by the assumptions they make based on the data versus the real world.\nFor me, its fundamental mistake is believing they have the whole spectrum of sales people included in the research. How many of you hitting your number, earning well would take time out of your day to do surveys for these people?\nRather strikes me that the follow up novel tries to correct all the flaws in this one, but if you are new they could be worth the read, but remember, there are volumes of theories all backed up with data to prove that their process works, so take the bits that are relevant from all you meet, and then weave your own magic until you find your personal style that works.",
    "Given to me as a present by someone at LinkedIn following a conversation we had about maximizing opportunities and potential, this is an interesting concept and approach, thoroughly researched.\n\nAt times it reads a little bit like an academic paper, with numerous references like ‘more of this in chapter X’ or ‘as we discussed in X’, but the message is clear, the identification is well made and the joint authorship flows well.\n\nCuriously, for me at least, the book doesn’t follow the challenger sale concept in talking about the potential of the CEB (formerly the Corporate Executive Board), but maybe that is because I have experienced its services first hand and so I already know about the benefits it offers.",
    "Interesting concepts, although much of book is spent on selling the methodology to the reader. Lots of detail on their customers using the techniques and how critical it is for everyone to adopt this \"new style\" of sales. Heavy sales-pitch nature of the book really comes across on the audio book version. Paper version avoids this and allows you to skim through at a faster pace.",
    "Really interesting book. Really challenging concepts especially to someone like me who has been congratulated over and over because of excellent communication skills.\nStarting a career in Sales, I am actually looking forward to applying a strategy that seems so unnatural. The concepts explained in the book make sense, now let's see how it translate in sales in my reality. Tevin GM",
    "Like many, I've had all of them; TAS, SPIN, NLP, and all of the other variations on the theme of \"how to make gazillions in sales\"\n\nThe thing that intrigued me was the suggestion that we should challenge customers for best results ultimately. For sure relationships, etc. are key the premise of this book is that customers will see value in a person/organisation that takes time to understand their business and then challenge the accepted wisdom where appropriate.\n\nWhilst still midway though the book, it is an interesting read and I'll reserve judgement til the end - although so far, so good."

    "This book is about principles. Money principles that will spill into other domains of your life. If you're looking for a step by step action plan of how to become wealthy, this is definitely not the book. You won't walk away with a set of tools to begin implementing on your journey to wealth. He does make some recommendations like invest in real estate, start a network marketing business, go into sales, and even to continue in your profession as a business not as an employee. But it doesn't show you how to do those things and the author doesn't make the promise that you'll do those things.\n\nHowever, if you have struggled to earn more or keep more of what you earn, you might find the same thing I did: Our money blueprint, like a thermostat, will hold us back from earning more unless we understand what our money thermostat is set to, and more importantly, why it's set where it is. This book has opened my eyes to much of the programming that has been running in my and my wife's subconscious. Within a matter of days after taking to heart the principles of this book, as if by magic, I started closing more sales, thinking about my business very differently, and lo and behold, having more cash in my bank (business and personal) than I ever had in my previous 15 years of marriage, or ever for that matter. I didn't have to attend his seminar, though many reviewers say this book is only a sales pitch to his seminar. I didn't start a new business, or go into network marketing (which has always been turned off). \n\nI also didn't just sit my butt on the couch and vision-board my way to more money. Instead, I have worked my tail off in the last few months more than I have in years but I've enjoyed it like never before, all while having more time with my wife and kids (both-and vs either-or).  \n\nI read and listened to the book 4 or 5 times now and continue to challenge my beliefs and attitudes about money and by doing that, changing how I show up for everything. For example, I had an unspoken belief that I don't deserve to earn more than minimum living standards, so even though I believe my business's services are top tier, I showed up to sales with little to no energy and as if I didn't believe in my own service. If I did make sales, I somehow found ways to get rid of the money by hiring staff unnecessarily, or \"investing\" in things that didn't drive my personal or business growth forward. Like a thermostat that was set at a certain level, no matter how much came in, I figured out a way to get rid of it without even realizing why I was doing it so that I only had just above minimum living standards. But when I became aware of this belief, and realized it wasn't true, I started closing more sales, being more prudent with how I allocated my money, and noticing different opportunities within the business to improve and grow.\n\nSo who is this book for?\n\nIt's certainly not for those who will only see this book as a sales pitch for his seminar. Don't get me wrong, he mentions his workshop 1000 times in the book LOL! But if you can't see past that, and throw the baby out with the bathwater, than you might have some blind spots that need to be worked out before you pass judgement on this book. Again, I say this as someone who has ONLY read this book and not paid for any of this training, coaching, seminars, products, etc.\n\nIt's also not for anyone who is looking for something more than principles. This book teaches you high-level concepts about the wealth mindset of wealthy people and puts it in terms that anyone can understand. For example, most of us are taught to work hard for your money, some of us are taught to save, and few are taught to make your money work hard for you through investments. This was an eye-opener for my wife, but for me it wasn't. It was just a reminder of what I have already known. How to invest, who to go into business with, how to hire, which network marketing to join, how to ask for more money, get better at sales, manage your business, details about building out systems, none of that is addressed in detail in this book. For that, you'll need to find additional resources from other authors. Unless T Harv Eker offers follow up books or \"dip your toes in the water\" low cost offers. As of this writing, I don't know if he offers any of these. I know for sure other authors provide you more detailed tools and tactical concepts not found in this book. \n\nThis book is for individuals who are stuck in their efforts to grow their wealth even when they have invested incredible amounts of time and money on pursuits that haven't panned out. It's for anyone who's tired of working the hamster wheel and not sure how to get off. \n\nThis book is for you if you want to know how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Hint: it's not about opportunities --- though I won't deny that the wealthier you become, the more opportunities present themselves but I would counter that they have more opportunities because they've acted upon previous opportunities and applied a positive money mindset to those opportunities. \n\nMay this book open the door to a whole new world that awaits you on the other side. I've accumulated more money in the last 4 months, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, than I ever did during two prior bull markets and even when earning more money. May the principles of this book do tenfold and hundredfold for you as it has done for me, whether you're in your twenties and fresh out of college, like me entering your 40's and wondering if the work you do has any meaning, or in your sixties wondering if it's too late. \nIt's NEVER too late. Unless you never take that first step. ",
    "This is a great book for learning the mindset of millionaires. I know this as I work with hundreds of multi-millionaires and see the belief systems taught in this book in the behaviors and attitudes of my millionaire clients.\n\nEnough said about the book... Let me tell you about the Live Seminar which is promoted in the book and which you are invited to go to for free with the coupon in the book. This T.Harv Eker MIllionaire Mind seminar is a HUGE Waste of Time!!!! I went to check it out as I have done seminars my whole life including many with the great Anthony Robbins, one of the greatest speakers of our time, Tony Robbins is a master of communication and teaching incredible skills and strategies for anything you want to achieve in life including financial wealth but this T. Harve Eker guy is not!!!....\n\nT Harv Eker was only at his seminar for 1/2 a day of the 3 day seminar. When T. Harv did arrive he arrogantly came out on stage as if he was \"The Man\" and began to speak. I found he lacked creating any sort of rapport with the audience and never really connected with us. He would yell at people in the audience for leaving to go to the bathroom saying they were copping out by not staying in the room. And he would humiliate people with his comments. Its one thing to movitate someone with pain but what he did was not that at all. I noticed the audience reaction of getting a little ticked off at the guy's comments as well as people just falling asleep during their hour long sales pitches. Many participants in the audience had a problem with the guy as they told me so themselves and resented being sold @ 10 times a day during the weekend. I had never been to a seminar where I heard so many bad comments about the speaker before.\n\nNow myself I know every phychological sales technique there is and this guy and his staff used them to manipulate and intimidate people to buy more of his books, tapes and seminars yet most of his staff were not millionaires... The 3 day weekend seminar was a huge sales pitch! They would reveiw a few things from the book which we already knew then tell you for the next hour to hour and half about some sort of seminar they have. From there they would create a sense of scarcity and fear to manipulate people to run to the back of the room and buy their seminar for a $1,000 - $4,000 or more. In their sales pitch they would say... we have the most famous or the most well know in the financial area at this seminar to teach you yet they would never tell you the guest speakers names...very secretive. Why? If I was going to spend $4,000 for a seminar I want to know who is teaching me and if they are so famous and great then telling us who they are will inspire more people to sign up. I found out from someone who went to one of his other seminars that in order to make the money they teach you to make in these other seminars you need to invest money in T.Harv's business recommendations of which I think he most likely makes money from as well. Not sure but it would make sense.\n\nI must have been pitched 20 or more different things at this seminar in 3 days. I felt like the whole weekend was a huge waste of my time and I was watching infomercials all weekend.\n\nI got very little out of this weekend seminar for the Millionaire Mind that wasn't in the book. Now, knowing Anthony Robbins material inside out, I noticed much of what was taught at T. Harv's seminar was stolen from Anthony Robbins seminars yet Harv Eker acted as if it as his own. Even some personal stories seemed to be very similar to Tony Robbins personal stories. Hmmmmm.... Only one thing he taught he gave Anthony Robbins credit for and it was a very elementary thing ( the legs of belief). Everything else was pretty much Robbins work yet done ineffectively by T. Harv from my expert opinion. Even the way the audience was warmed up to the exact stretching sequence routine was Tony Robbins stuff at T. Harv's seminar. Much of the same music was played also. I mean come on that kind of stuff you can switch up.\n\nWhen it was time to do mental imagery, Eker read it from a piece of paper with much of the techniques again were from Anthony Robbins, but Harv and his staff couldn't quite pull them off like Tony. I have done mental imagery with large groups of people and when you know your stuff you don't need a piece of paper to read from. If you have done it so much you have it memorized in your head and you taylor it to your audience. When reading the imagery exercises of his paper, T. Harv had no emotion in his vocal tone to inspire people into emotion for making the mental changes he wanted from them. It was unimpressive to say the least.\n\nI was completely unimpressed with T.Harv Eker as a speaker. Lots of EGO with this guy which was a turn off to me and believe me I have sat through some poor seminars in the last 30 years so I speak from broad experience. I was completely disappointed from the man I thought I knew and liked from this good Millionaire Mind book with the real man himself.\n\nAs a writer, T. Harve Eker is good and he should just stick to that in my opinion and stop ripping off other speakers material and ineffectively appling it in seminar.\n\nDon't waste your time or money on his Millionare Mind seminar. I felt like I should have been compensated for my wasted time and weekend. As a person who has attended allot of seminars in my life attaining certifications as well with great speakers and teachers such as Anthony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, John Grey, John Bradshaw, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, Louis Hay, Suzy Orman, Ken Blanchard... I can say from comparison \"Skip the Millionaire Mind Seminar.\" Instead stay home and read the book again! Even better buy those books of the Writers/Speakers I list above and read them!",
    "The current “manifestation” culture comes from this. Down to earth. Easy read. Some humor. I read it in an afternoon at the spa. Worth it - will read again",
    "This book has already major soft in my happiness and thought process.\n\nI am excited about what I've learned and the decisions and commitments I've made.",
    "I haven't finished reading this book yet but am thoroughly enjoying it. I find it very challenging and have been inspired to make changes in the way I handle my finances because of what I have read in the book. The author suggests manageable goals with each chapter and gives lots of motivational help. I have been so impacted by what I have read that I have shared with my friends about the changes I have been inspired to make. I wish I had read this book years ago. I would thoroughly recommend it.",
    "An engaging read. I believe that some of the ideas presented may impact on people moving forward in the area of wealth because of their upbringing and limiting thoughts. However, I struggle to believe that we all can be millionaires. I thought the book had some good strategies on Money management and will I will endeavour to work on those elements presented in the book to better my management of my finances. Worth a read.",
    "This book is quite unique in its approach on how to become a millionaire and improve your mindset to help guarantee success. The teachings in this book make it very memorable and offer some insight that we easily overlook or never consider in the first place. I will say that I was expecting a bit more from this book in terms of other teachings but overall a positive experience.",
    "Some good advice in this book that people will find useful. My problem was that the writer on nearly every other page keeps making references to his seminars/work shops classes trying to promote them. Yes its important he should make people aware of those classes and their benefits but to me it came across as overselling.",
    "Although a short book it is packed with lots of sensible information.\n\nAlas the message is, if you don't have the mindset to be a millionaire you never will.\n\nConvincing the subconscious with declarations of intention is quite a challenge for any doubting Thomas.\n\nThis is a book you can constantly refer to dipping in and out when required."

    "Great message but the book gets very repetitive at times",
    "As others have said, it's not necessarily a great book to read -- it's not exciting, it's repetitive, and it could be a whole lot shorter. However, it IS very impactful and full of some great info that I've been able to start implementing IMMEDIATELY. This is the first book in a while that I pulled out a highlighter for and actually marked it up. There are a lot of things in it that I want to revisit.\n\nUltimately, the book helps shine a light at your management style and most people reading it will likely realize that they're being an accidental diminisher in certain aspects of their work. This book helps identify those areas and offers ways to improve on them.",
    "'Multipliers' is a book that looks at the leadership role in a newly articulated way. A \"multiplier\" is the type of person and leader that makes people around them better performers. On the other hand, you have \"diminishes\" whom may be very intelligent and qualified, plus diligent, but they diminish the capabilities of those they work with. The landscape of leadership has changed according to the author. A great leader is no longer the genius at the top, but rather those around them that they raise to genius level acuity and propel to work their best. I think there's truth to this, and as I grow my companies I'm working on I will take that approach to heart. Intuitively, it resonates with me as I do not feel that my personal will and intelligence are good enough to thrust a great organization forward, but rather I have to inspire those I will work with in the future. A good example is my favorite current NBA basketball player, Lebron James. What makes Lebron great is not only his individual skill and talent, but also his ability to raise the level of performance of his teammates and his organization. He doesn't inspire by fear and he doesn't scold and scare other players into performing better, but rather he inspires by his own efforts and confidence in his teammates.\n\nAll of that being said, I give this book a 3-star rating because as it was an interesting read, with many interesting case studies, it dragged on much too long and got too deeply involved with vague examples of the author's workings with many companies. While I believe in the multiplier effect, I don't know if every example in the book was pertinent. I believe it may have just been too long of a book. It's filled with lists, jargon, steps, etc. I read from cover to back, but on this one, you may reconsider that. I had to skip a few pages that I had not had the patience for. I still read around 95%+ of the book, so no worries, I didn't skim! But I certainly could have and gotten the point that way. Although I've rated it 3-stars, it certainly isn't a bad book and I have many highlights in it that I will surely refer to in the future when running my own organization.",
    "As a new hire at a new company, the CEO strongly encouraged all new employees to read this book. I'm always up for reading new books and learning new insights on leadership and leadership styles. Historically I found that I thrived under female leadership and I struggled under male leadership. I initially thought that this was a Mars/Venus in the workplace situation, which gives tips on how to work with the other planet (ie: walking on egg shells and not being my true self). After reading Liz's book, I quickly discovered why I thrived under female leadership. All my female leaders were Multipliers!!\n\nIn my new organization, everyone is a Multiplier! Males and females alike! The CEO has surrounded herself with Multipliers, and I am over the moon excited to be working where I am now!\n\nSo, are you a Diminisher or a Multiplier? Read this book and find out. If you're a Diminisher and want to become a Multiplier, she gives tips on how to change.\n\nIt's a quick and easy read, so what's stopping you?",
    "I quote this book often in my discussions with staff and other leaders. Perhaps it is the work environment that I am in, Diminishers, that really made me want to put a finger on a lot of the things that just don’t go right here. However, reading this book gives insight and clues into how this can be turned around and for that context that it gave me I am thankful. It’s a great book that I often recommend to colleagues.",
    "This book tells you exactly how to get as close to the Multiplier end of the scale as you can get. It gets you to consider your own management and leadership style and what you get from your workers as a result of how and what you do. It will tell you how to shift your thinking and how and where to change your methods, so you start to get more brainpower from your people. What’s more, they will want to give it!\n\nThis book really helped me. It’s different from the many leadership books that are out there. What’s so great is that it is so precise, it goes down several layers providing easy to understand practical insights into exactly how to lead like a Multiplier. You can easily refer back to this book too as it provides Multiplier Formulas in short sound bites after each chapter.",
    "We've all worked with the opposite of multipliers, what the book calls 'dimishers' and this book gives helpful tips on how to develop the skills to be a multiplier. Lots of reflect upon. The only downside is that it starts to feel quite repetitive as you work through the chapters.",
    "Talks a lot about the author, her qualifications, and the need for the book, but provides little valuable insight and seems to contain a lot of anecdote and fluff",
    "Not a bad book, not an amazing book. It's got some good concepts but to me it felt like rehashed stuff I'd read before. To be fair however it neatly summarised various important points and would be a great book for someone who is aspiring to change the way they lead others, or those looking to get into a leadership post.",
    "Fascinating book! It made me think a lot about my experiences with my manager as well as my own way of leading and engaging a team."

    "What author would write a book with a target audience that is likely to consider reading it, much less paying for it, akin to wishing for a root canal? Apparently, Ijeoma Oluo.\n\nI am a white, sexagenarian, male, and former CEO. I am, therefore, a r#cist. (And yes, I am being sensitive to the censors who will look at this before posting it.) And I accept that because this isn’t about me. My personal tolerance is irrelevant. If a picture says a thousand words, an action is worth ten thousand pictures. That is how we should judge each other.\n\nFrom my very privileged position in America, I have had a bird’s eye view of the systemic, institutional privilege (which in the negative is discrimination) that currently defines virtually all Western institutions today, including virtually all corporations.\n\nWomen have not shattered the corporate glass ceiling because the corporate institution was designed and built by men. Blacks have not achieved equity in the economic arena because it was designed by white men. Which is why, as Ijeoma points out, it really doesn’t matter if the man in charge is a racist or a misogynist or not.\n\nThe #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements are all about gender and racial discrimination. What has enabled misogyny and racism, however, is the definition and allocation of power in our institutions and our society. Tolerance is great, but it’s nowhere near enough. Until we challenge the structure of power, we will not address the underlying cause of social and economic injustice.\n\nHere are the main takeaways I got from this book:\n\n- It’s not about me or Ijeoma. This is about structural injustice.\n- It’s not about the tone of the discussion. This is about structural injustice.\n- It’s not about intent. This is about structural injustice.\n- It’s not about who is right and who is wrong. This is about structural injustice.\n- It’s not about who can use what words. This is about structural injustice.\n\nIn the end, the great strength and the great weakness of our political economy is our over-riding emphasis on the individual and his or her opportunities and rights. There’s nothing wrong with that per se. But in this crowded, technologically enabled world we live in, it’s not enough. We can live individually but we can only be judged collectively. Our insistence that every conversation be about me, or you, or Ijeoma, or that person over there, is blinding us to the degree that we really are all in this together.\n\nScientists used to view the environment as a collection of independent and discrete parts. There was a prairie here, an Arctic ice field there, and a rain forest someplace a long way away. They now realize, however, that there is only one ecosystem and what happens in the rain forest is just as important as what happens in the Iowa corn field.\n\nOther scientists have discovered the same thing about the other hard and soft sciences. Biology and economics don’t cut it any more. We have to think in terms of evolutionary biology and behavioral economy. Real understanding lies not just within a functional discipline, but also in the spaces that separates them and the overlaps that interconnect them.\n\nSo, I go back to my original question. Why did Ijeoma write this book? I won’t pretend to know the answer but it is clear that she has a genuine desire to see us face the issue. And after reading this book it is clear that the desire is genuine. And while it is theoretically true that if she is successful she will have to find something new to write about, so what? That is exactly the kind of binary, digital thinking that is at the heart of the problem. Life is not either/or. It is, with tolerance, and/but.\n\nIjeoma has a perspective. And the tone is sometimes a bit harsh. But how could it not be? In the end I think the most amazing and laudable thing about her language is that she obviously worked so hard to keep a lid on her passion. If she were white, we would elect her to high office.\n\nAm I appropriating Ijeoma’s book by writing this review? Yes. But that’s irrelevant. I am not her. And my appropriation is going to paint racism with a white brush and, potentially, demean that pain. But that is the thinking of a binary thinker—either/or. And that, in the end, is what we have to overcome. Tolerant people are not binary thinkers. Tolerance is not a function of embracing the other side of the binary issue. It is about eliminating the binary divide. Ultimately, the racism talked about here is about institutional models of power that disadvantage one group over another. (And, as Ijeoma points out, there are many.)\n\nIn the end, I won’t say this was the most pleasant read. It was, however, a good read. It made me think. And for that I am grateful to the author. I won’t say, “well done,” because that would be an appropriation, as if I could evaluate how well she had represented her pain. I can’t. It’s hers, not mine. I will say, however, that “I listened.” And I listened because you were clear and authentic. And I do thank you for that.\n\nA must read. Period.",
    "It seems the author wrote this book with the understanding that people were going to get triggered and stop reading at a certain point. It starts off straightforward and somewhat like a job training type approach. Slowly, over the course of the book, the author shares more personal details, more of her passion and heart and longing for a better world. She shares the why behind her book from the beginning, making it clear that the lives of non white people are at stake. She saves the heaviest hitting chapter for almost the end, hoping anyone who made it that far might consider what she has to say, despite the difficulty in hearing it. Finally, a call to action in any way we can safely manage, with many suggestions as to how to go about that.\n\nThere were some parts of the book I didn’t agree with. For me, this did not detract from the importance of the overall message. I care about this issue and I’m willing to set aside some disagreements to work together for positive change. The author believes this change is possible and cites evidence. Her solution does not involve violence, or a major overall of government. Her solutions are extremely doable. Piece by piece, one step at a time. I’m grateful for this book and the impact it had on me, and all the things I learned.",
    "I love how upfront the author is about her experiece with racism in this book. She writes it clearly and concisely. Her book is a great way to better your empathy with racism and others who experience that daily. Or her book could be a sign saying you are not alone!",
    "Good insight about the reality of everyday life for a person of color. Hard to read at times yet very important work. Helps me to be more sensitive and understanding of others and determined to work at not being racist.",
    "We are having a family reunion next week which includes one son's four half-black sons, a daughter's two half-Chinese grand-children and another son's adopted Hispanic son. I suspect that eventually there will be so many mixed families like ours that those who keep claiming that ALL whites are racists will finally just be ignored.\n\nAt first I was impressed with the author's writing ability and the way she treated some topics. By the time I finished the book, I agreed with the following comments made by other readers.\n\nThe author is forcing her sexual identity into a book that's supposed to be about race. She continually forces lesbian, trans, and other groups into a book that I believed to be about race.\n\nThis is full of hypocritical generalities about white people. The author has the audacity to talk about racism while judging others by the color of their skin. This goes as far as disrespecting her own mother for the same reason. It's not easy to be a person of color in this country, but we have many marginalized people here and throughout the world. Blaming others solely based on their skin color is counter-productive and produces an even larger gap. I'm ashamed and would like a focus on the future of what a diverse and unified country means. This book just fuels the racial divide.\n\nThis was the most racist book I've ever read. It was a difficult book to read, because her every viewpoint is biased and racist. Any slight, actual, or perceived, is made a statement on racism. And finally, towards the end, she says it outright, \"If you are white, you are a racist.\"\n\nThis book is a memoir and collection of the author's opinions based on her experiences and beliefs. It is self-serving. It is not a forum for open discussion or a foundational piece to begin discussion. You either agree with her or you are maligned.\n\nI did not actually listen to this story. I know how it ends. The plot involves my ignorance, and the surprise reveal is that I am actually a racist and I need to feel guilty for things I didn't do.\n\nTo say that all white people are racist and that other races can't be racist IS racist, demeaning, divisive, and dangerous.\n\nInequality of outcome does not equal racism. It means blacks have deep self-inflicted cultural issues that they need to work out themselves. Systemic racism in police? An average of 4,472 black men are killed by other black men annually. An average of 112 black men died from both justified and unjustified police-involved killings annually. It would take cops 40 years to kill the amount of blacks that blacks kill themselves yearly.\n\nIn other words, we’re not learning to have “conversations” about race; we’re learning how to lecture people about race. If you’re black, then you’re encouraged to educate whites on the systemic oppression of blacks (but only if you’re comfortable doing so). If you’re white, then you’re encouraged to shut up, listen, seek more knowledge (blacks can’t be expected to constantly educate everyone), and then start advocating for people of color.\n\nI feel the book totally missed the mark by claiming that everything that happened to her was racism, when in reality, it is obstacles that everyone faces as a part of life. Nothing is handed to us, at least for most. The book really made me feel angry. I hope the author can learn from the extensive feedback and can grow in her own perception of the issue.\n\nThis book is like a long winded opinion piece filled with rhetoric with little to no statistical or research based notations. To read this book you already have to agree with what the author believes...otherwise this will be very difficult to read.",
    "A great, well-written read that explains difficult and complex topics around race in really straightforward, easy-to-understand ways (yet still acknowledges the intricacies of the subject matter and doesn't oversimplify). If you are interested in understanding racism and privilege - particularly as a white person who wants to contribute to fighting racism but doesn't know where to start - this is a really great book to read.",
    "Ijeoma Oluo's book came out about race in America about six months after Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote about race in the UK in her book Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race. Maybe I prefer the one that I read first because I read it first, or maybe I prefer the first author's style. Regardless of the difference in stars I rated them, they are both must-reads and cover a lot of common ground and I recommend them both (but this one less than Eddo-Lodge's).\n\nOluo's research is impeccable, I found the history of our police forces to be fascinating.\nI love it when she teaches us simple things that I can remember, like terms like \"black-on-black crime or brown-on-brown crime are 100% racist... Crime is a problem within communities. And communities with higher poverty, fewer jobs, and less infrastructure are going to have higher crime, regardless of race,\" or explaining affirmative action as meaning \"if there are 10% black people in the area, the ultimate goal (not quota) would be around 10% black employees or students. The goal is simply equal opportunity for female applicants and applicants of color. Why would a representational number of people of color be so much less competitive than a representational number of white people?\".\n\nHowever when Oluo gives her own personal reasons why hair touching is a big deal for example, I felt there was some repetition and subjective hyperbole. And this might be a failing on my own part, but for some of the reasons Oluo so expertly defends the right of black people to know what's racist when white people talk I didn't feel comfortable with her talking about anti-Asian discrimination.",
    "Great book, simply written, clear and concise. Gives the tools to really try and make a difference day-to-day. Even though I’m British, I feel these examples definitely translate. Educational and honest in equal measure. We’re all guilty of virtue signalling and wanting to prove we’re not bad people, and this cuts right through that. Excellently done.",
    "Oh my goodness this is good. Really good. It's beautifully written, pulls no punches, and really gets the point across. I wish I could make everyone read this book, it's that good. Brilliant, in fact. Read it, then let your friends read it. It's not an easy read - but it's absolutely worth it, as every page makes you think.",
    "Whenever I've talked with white people about issues regarding race, white supremacy, and privilege, there is a ubiquitous response to some degree or another: defensiveness. This includes from myself (I am white). I'm not here to comment on whether any of the defences are justified or not, but to say that this book addresses this issue (and that of denial) in a way which I found incredibly effective.\n\nI understand how people can be put of by a piece of writing, a person, or - in the worst case - a cause, because of the way a topic is handled - for example if the language used is provocative and aggravating. But, as Ijeoma puts it, \"When you instead shift your focus to getting people of colour to fight oppression in a way in which you approve, racial justice is no longer your main goal - your approval is\". It's Ijeoma's understanding, paired with her steadfastness, which really impressed me, and made it what I think is a very approachable book which doesn't sugar-coat or ignore uncomfortable issues. I think this is a brilliantly productive way to proceed with the topic.\n\nThe book covers a good selection of topics, some of which I was unaware of before reading it - so I'm glad to have my awareness raised to many issues, and mind opened in many specific areas and in the bigger picture."

There were many fascinating anecdotes and examples from history, pop culture, business, etc. to make the information easy to digest, but all of it was backed by research and years of studies.

    "One of the ways to be “efficient” is to be able to quickly engage with your potential mate, counterpart, partner, or audience. This takes charisma, which the book clearly and directly shows you how to achieve.\n\nThe examples in this book are well-researched behavioral topics which are immediately actionable to help you with your everyday interactions. Unlike similar books which are often difficult to understand, this author makes a potentially dense topic applicable to emails, meeting people, texting, and public speaking with clear examples. It is a very easy read.\n\nAs a “competent” professional, I immediately *intentionally* implemented some of the “warm” cues to enhance engagement and interaction with my “customers” – can you say charisma?!\n\nYes. Charisma is a teachable / learnable skill.\n\nKnowledge of the cues will also allow you to clearly decipher another’s body language so you can immediately and CONTEXTUALLY respond to your advantage. This impacts on everyday interactions such as dating, sales, or simply speaking with your significant other.\n\nI changed how I set up one of my video cameras based on some of the recommendations in the book so I can improve audience engagement in my online videos. I changed what I do when I first meet a new “customer” to immediately “bond” by encoding multiple cues.\n\nWe all have great ideas. Minding your Ps and “cues” will help you DELIVER your great ideas so they are not inadvertently lost in communication.\n\nLearn your cues. Reach your success efficiently.\n\nP.S. I will be hosting a book club among my professional colleagues on this book very soon. It’s THAT impactful.",

    "Have you wondered why some people seem to ignore you when you share an idea, only to have one of your colleagues pitch the exact same idea and get noticed? Do you struggle with social engagements and feel as if people want to just move on after a few minutes? Or do you just want to become better, more engaging, and more influential?\n\nIn her new book, Cues, Vanessa Van Edwards breaks down the secret sauce that can help us to all become more charismatic. Vanessa starts with an explanation of what exactly is charisma. Spoiler alert, it is a myth that people are just born with charisma. The good news is that we all have the power to change, and Vanessa provides us insights on how.\n\nWith every verbal or nonverbal interaction, we are sending cues to others. Vanessa defines cues as the powerful verbal, nonverbal, and vocal signals humans send to each other. In Cues, Vanessa breaks myriad cues into 4 cue buckets (nonverbal, vocal, verbal, imagery). Each of these is clearly explained and she provides relevant examples from celebrities, media, and TV shows.\n\nIn addition to the material in the book, Vanessa shares how to access several digital bonuses including videos of the actual examples, book club discussion questions, and an upcoming app.\nAs Vanessa advises, don't leave charisma up to chance. You have the power to send the cues to increase your charisma. Be in control of your cues, read Cues.",
    "I have read “Captivate” and some of “Cues” so far. There’s so much information in the two books that I’m going to re-read both books a few times. Very well written and very informative. Thank you.",
    "I have previously read Vanessa's book Captivate and have done some of her courses and they are always excellent.\n\nThis book is no different and I think it is her best work. Vanessa has created a guide that has the power to help you transform your communications, whether it is better understanding the signals coming your way or to appreciate the signals you are sending in any communication setting you are in. So in essence it helps you understand the encoding and decoding of cues to become a charismatic communicator.\n\nThe book is absolutely packed with useful information, it is easy to read, accessible and also very interesting and entertaining.\n\nVanessa covers nonverbal, vocal, verbal and imagery cues and all her work is based on solid science. Each chapter comes with powerful illustrations, outlining principles, fun tips and a chapter challenge which allows you to then apply the concepts.\n\nI was blown away by many of the cues and how much I have learnt from the book. Vanessa provides a clear road map to help build powerful people skills that can be used in any setting and has use cases for everyone. Even if you read just a few chapters, you will get something out of it but once you start reading it, you will want to read all of it and better still, put all the learning into practice. This is learning that should also be taught in schools and universities, it has the power to have a massive positive impact and I am grateful that I have been exposed to this.\n\nThe book also comes with digital bonuses. There is a website mentioned towards the end and this then has a Cues diagnostic quiz, workbook, reading guide, a masterclass that is 2 hours long and chapter by chapter resources which include quizzes, lots of video content and really helpful images. Vanessa has also created a digital companion app as part of the bonus which in essence provides a summary of all the great information in the book. All of which is free as part of buying the book. This brings the concepts of the book to life and are a very rich set of learning tools.\n\nI absolutely love how much value Vanessa is providing with this book and her passion to help people become a better version of themselves, making a massive impact through becoming charismatic communicators. It is a book I will be referring to often and a book I recommend to everyone.",
    "Cues is a wonderful insight into how to read other people and how they may be feeling. If you can learn to identify and react positively to the cues in this book, your personal and working relationships will improve dramatically and you can live a much happier life.\n\nMy only negative comment is directed at Amazon. The cardboard cover the book arrived in was partially opened and the bottom corner of the book was slightly bashed in. Amazons warehouse staff need to be a bit more respectful .\n\nStill, 10 out of 10 Vanessa. Top quality as always.",
    "Cues is a deep dive into body language that does an incredible job of articulating everything you need to know. This book will boost your confidence, charismatic presence and connectivity with others, allowing you to build engaging relationships. For anyone wanting to be able to physically communicate more effectively socially and professionally. This is a must own.",
    "It's not often that I write reviews for books. However, I feel compelled to write one for Cues by VVE. I started the intro during my lunch break and completed chapter 1 before going to bed. However, the following morning I felt the urge to complete the first five chapters before starting my day. At every chapter, you will pause, reflect, and find examples of testing and measuring the cues. Even when I arrived at work in the morning, colleagues asked me why I was so pumped and engaging?",

    "So I just received my book and it came in a wrapper brand new. This book have 32 chapters 25 questions per chapters with answer key in the back of the book. I’ve read so many good reviews online & from my peers I can’t wait to start studying to pass the written test🤞🏽🙏🏽",
    "This book is amazing if you have to take a Milady final test in school, or have Unit tests you need to study for. For state boards, at least in Minnesota, it was helpful to look over before the test. (Does not have your state’s laws and rules)",
    "Definitely worth it to help study!",
    "Book came written in, with bent and stained pages and the cover bent in half. Oh well I guess I won't need it for very long.",
    "I like that it appears to be new considering that a lot of people order and received used. All pages look fresh, 32 chapters questions and answer key in back of book. It’s also room for note taking in the back. I say get caz I just needed the book to review because I let my license expire over a long period of time. So now I have to retake both exams.",
    "Studying, the product was fine",
    "I like everything about this book.",
    "Really excited to study! Book doesn’t seem to be used came packaged nicely and securely.",
    "I purchase this book in December because I have to re-sit the hairstyling exam here in Canada. I am certified from my home country for more that 14th years, ho-well! Comparing to the 3rd edition that I used that time this one has so much new information I literally feel like I need to go back to hairstyling school again. The questions are down to T with the information in the theory text book.\nOne thing I would love to know tho- is the questions given in the exam the same as how they are asked in the exam review?.\nI actually find the information very easy to digest but no time to complete the book much less to book the exam date. I recommend it anyday...",
    "I passed my Red seal exam thanks to this book",
    "There are drawing on the pages in the book. Definitely wasn’t in good condition.",
    "Good exam review although I wish there was more to this $40 book. Perhaps more difficult questions? The trade exam can't be that easy...can it?",
    "Very convenient"

    "Some books for me are \"game changers.\" All of Malcolm Gladwell's books fall into this category: \"Tipping Point,\" \"Blink\" and \"Outliers.\" Frans Johansson's \"The Medici Effect\" prompted me to organize two leadership gatherings: The White Rhino Intersection and Intersection 2.0. Daniel Pink's latest book, \"Drive,\" belongs in this same category. I love what Gladwell said about Pink's book: \"I spent as much time thinking about what this book means as I did reading it.\" Well said; I have had the same response.\n\nTo regular readers of The White Rhino Report, Pink is no stranger. I wrote effusively about his earlier book, \"A Whole New Mind.\"\n\nI recently offered a link to a TED talk that summarizes the most salient points of \"Drive.\"\n\nHaving been thoroughly mesmerized and intrigued by the \"Drive\" video, I wondered if I needed to read the book. I am glad I chose to take that additional step. The video serves as an excellent appetizer and introductory tool, but the main nutrient's can be found in the book.\n\nPink's genius is his ability to take previously published research from a variety of fields, synthesize and coordinate the data and present the findings to a lay audience in a way that does not \"dumb down\" the content or the significance of the discoveries. He takes the \"what,\" and turns it into a powerful \"so what?\".\n\nIn discussing what motivates individuals and teams in almost any setting, Pink describes two types of motivation: Type X (extrinsic) and Type I (intrinsic).\n\n\"Type I behavior is a renewable resource. Think of Type X behavior as coal, and Type I behavior as the sun. For most of recent history, coal has been the cheapest, easiest, most efficient resource. But coal has two downsides. First, it produces nasty things like air pollution and greenhouse gases. Second, it's finite; getting more of it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive each year. Type X behavior is similar. An emphasis on rewards and punishments spews its own externalities. And 'if-then' motivators always grow more expensive. But Type I behavior, which is built around intrinsic motivation, draws on resources that are easily replenished and inflict little damage. It is the motivational equivalent of clean energy: inexpensive, safe to use, and endlessly renewable.\" (Page 80)\n\nHe goes on to describe what lies at the heart of Type I behavior and the underlying motivations. He issues what amounts to a manifesto for change.\n\n\"Ultimately, Type I behavior depends upon three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. and it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose. Some might dismiss notions like these as gooey and idealistic, but the science says otherwise. The science confirms that this sort of behavior is essential to being human - and that now, in a rapidly changing economy, it is also critical for professional, personal, and organizational success of any kind. So we have a choice. We can cling to a view of human motivation that is grounded more in old habits than in modern science. Or we can listen to the research, drag our business and personal practices into the twenty-first century, and craft a new operating system to help ourselves, our companies, and our world work a little better. It won't be easy. It won't happen overnight. So let's get started.\" (Pages 80-81)\n\nAs the author continues to sketch out the components of what he calls Motivation 3.0 - a large quantum leap beyond the traditional Motivation 2.0 that fueled the Industrial Revolution - he describes four aspects of autonomy.\n\n\"And what a few future-looking businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy - in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with. As Atlassian's experience shows, Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T's: their task, their time, their technique, and their team.\" (Pages 93-94)\n\nIn discussing the importance of \"Purpose\" as a factor in motivation, Pink's work comes close to the themes of the book \"Half Time - Moving from Success to Significance,\" by Bob Buford, which I reviewed in this space a few months ago:\n\nThese themes are also resonant with Rick Warren's best-seller, \"The Purpose Driven Life.\"\n\nThe demographic time bomb that is my generation of Baby Boomers presents an interesting dilemma and opportunity occasioned by our anticipated increased longevity.\n\n\"Upon comprehending that they could have another twenty-five years, sixty-year-old boomers look back twenty-five years - to when they were thirty-five - and a sudden thought clonks them on the side of the head. 'Wow. That sure happened fast,' they say. 'Will the next twenty-five years race by like that? If so, when I am going to do something that matters? When am I going to live my best life? When am I going to make a difference in the world?'\n\nThose questions, which swirl through conversations taking place at boomer kitchen tables around the world, may sound touch-feely. But they're now occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human civilization. Consider: Boomers are the largest demographic cohort in most western countries, as well as in places like Japan, Australia and New Zealand. . . In America alone, one hundred boomers turn sixty every thirteen minutes. When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen.\" (Pages 132-133)\n\nIn my observation, the impact is even more dramatic than that which Pink describes. In my role as a career coach, life coach, recruiter and mentor to many emerging leaders, men and women are beginning to ask the \"purpose question\" at increasingly younger ages. This bodes well for our future, and will force companies to address this issue if they hope to survive and to attract and to retain top talent.\n\nThe purpose dynamic has another aspect to it. In the absence of working for a higher purpose, Type X high achievers - the classic \"Type A\" personalities - work longer and longer hours to achieve material success and promotion. The result is burnout and dissatisfaction.\n\n\"One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers in that they're not having good relationships. They're busy making money and attending to themselves, and that means that there's less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count.\" (Page 144)\n\nIn the title of this review, I call this book a \"Must Read,\" yet the book is not for everyone. I recommend it to you only if you meet the following criteria:\n\n* You are a life-long learner who is willing to learn new facts and to change your thinking and behavior in accordance with these new insights.\n* You are in a position of leadership - in a company, in the military, in a family, in a school, in an organization - in which you need to and desire to create an environment of work and learning that maximizes autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n* You want to make a positive difference in the world and in the lives of those whom you influence.\n\nIf this is you, then order this book now, devour it, breath it, taste it, smell it, talk about it and live it. And then pass it on to the next generation of Type I leaders.\n\nEnjoy the drive . . . and the journey!\n\nAl",
    "One of the great feats of being a small business owner -- besides being part of the backbone of America's economy -- is that one gets to spend evenings reading books and magazines about organizational management and other business topics in a continuous effort to improve one's own skills.\n\nOr so the theory goes. Yours truly, in fact, prefers to read about philosophy and history and would consider Plato to be the best organizational guru there ever was. Preferred self-help works include Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\". But occasionally, nudged by the missus, I'll open up one of the works on her growing list of recommendations and start reading.\n\nSo it happened that I bumped into \"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\" by Daniel Pink. In this book the author argues that how the vast majority of companies are motivating their workers \"extrinsically\" is completely outdated in our modern economy: \"They continue to pursue practices such as short-term incentive plans and pay-for-performance schemes in the face of mounting evidence that such measures usually don’t work and often do harm.\" These monetary rewards, Pink writes, \"can deliver a short-term boost — just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off — and, worse, can reduce a person's longer-term motivation to continue the project.\" In today's world, the author argues, folks are motivated intrinsically. You leave them to their own devices, don't burden them with sticks and carrots, and the creativity will start flowing like the Mississipi River.\n\nThis book is certainly interesting. The author puts forth a straightforward argument and provides ample research to back up his thesis, some of it eye-opening. Who would guess that young children are more motivated to produce a drawing if they are not expecting a reward after the fact? In another example, \"researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy, the other half relying on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover.\"\n\nIt all sounds solid enough, though the question arises which companies are being investigated here. Are these Cornell researchers comparing start-ups run by fresh college grads in Silicon Valley to the McDonald's in Pleasant Hill, Iowa? Or are we talking about similar industries in order to level the playing field? As mentioned above, this reviewer owns a small business himself -- though not of the glamorous kind -- and gets the sense that Pink's head exists in a bubble of Facebook, Apple, Uber and other innovative tech giants. His examples of companies motivating their employees the 'correct' way -- Atlassian (software), 3M, Netflix, Zappos.com, JetBlue, Facebook and more such companies -- suggest as much. Pink has little to say about the unmotivated piece of work fixing your sub over at the gas station, or about the housekeeper cleaning your hotel room at the La Quinta during your April Florida vacation.\n\nThe author himself would deny this, of course, and in his defense, he does briefly address the issue of non-creative repetitive labor: \"Whether you’re fixing sinks, ringing up groceries, selling cars, or writing a lesson plan, you and I need autonomy just as deeply as a great painter.\" But, he continues, the majority of us will at first struggle when thrown into the deep waters of \"undiluted autonomy\", and hence \"Organizations must provide ... 'scaffolding' to help every employee find his footing to make the transition.\" Fair enough, but what does this \"scaffolding\" entail in a practical sense? It doesn't become very clear from proceeding through Pink's pages.\n\nNext follow some Rousseauian observations about human nature that the grand master of philosophical folly could himself have whipped up: \"We're designed to be Type I [motivated by intrinsic desires]. But outside forces -- including the very idea that we need to be 'managed' -- have conspired to change our default setting and turn us into Type X [motivated by extrinsic desires]. If we update the environments we're in -- not only at work, but also at school and at home -- and if leaders recognize both the truth of the human condition and the science that supports it, we can return ourselves and our colleagues to our natural state.\" And, quoting a researcher on the topic: \"The course of human history has always moved in the direction of greater freedom. And there's a reason for that -- because it's in our nature to push for it.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but human history is not moving unstoppably towards greater freedom any more than I, employer, am suppressing my workers' creative nature by setting deadlines and doling out incentives. What is happening here is that we in the West have arrived at an utter anomaly in human history in which the battle for basic subsistence has been won (for now) and that we are at liberty to enjoy the unprecedented luxuries brought forth by science, technology and the arts. It is certainly true that these fields are driven forward by man's intrinsic curiosity and desire to create new things, and the fact that they have thrust our civilization -- if not humanity at large -- to great heights should instill an enormous dose of gratitude and humility in us.\n\nBut back down on Earth, real goods still need to be produced, not just dreamed up by hipster types: Oil and gas need to be pumped to the surface, corn and wheat have to be harvested, cars need to be assembled, hotel rooms need to be cleaned, restaurant meals have to be cooked, and homes need to be built. Much of the production of these goods revolves around basic, repetitive tasks and invokes a certain level of dread and boredom. From my personal experience, the majority of workers involved want to work just enough hours for their paycheck to hold them over to the next one (and who can blame them?). The successful completion of their tasks is contingent upon a supervisor setting clear expectations, checking for quality of work after the fact, and showing gratitude for good behavior by continuing the employment relationship and handing out a nice paycheck.\n\nNone of this is to say that “Drive” isn't worth your valuable time. As with many such works, one takes a few good ideas and runs with them. While I can't afford to allow my employees to spend twenty percent of their time brainstorming about new products or process improvements, there's nothing stopping me from empowering them to have a say in how things are done in my company. So how about coming together for a half-day plenary session every three months and allow the staff to blurt out any idea that might have popped up in their head? I might just give it a try.\n\nWith all this in mind, I would recommend this book to certain types of readers, such as consultants, employers or the budding and dreaming entrepreneur. Just don't expect to be blown away by every word you're reading.",
    "Definitivamente es un cambio. Lo que el autor ofrece es algo tan sencillo, y, a la vez, tan radical que la primera reacción es de incredulidad. Pero el qué y el cómo y sus beneficios, descritos de una manera tan amena, invitan a uno a hacer cambios inmediatos en su vida y trabajo. Definitivamente una lectura que recordaré toda mi vida.",
    "I'm worried about this book. Rather, I'm worried about the need for this book. How is it that anyone alive is \"surprised\" that people do things for the sake of doing things, when damn near everyone alive has spent their whole lives doing just that?\n\nSadly that is the entirety of his insight, and Pink talks around it (and around and around it) without ever getting anywhere else.",
    "Pink sets out to demolish long-held beliefs such as that people are only motivated by extrinsic factors and he does so with gusto. While primarily focusing on the business world, most of the things he says apply directly to education as well.\nPink starts by making a useful distinction between ‘algorithmic’ and ‘heuristic’ tasks (p. 29). The former are ones which you perform by following a series of pre-determined steps, while the latter require a more creative approach. Crucially, the latter are far more motivating! In our field this would translate into a distinction between, say, the standard transformation exercise and an activity like improvising and recording a monologue. The big Q for us is: what is the ratio between these two types of activities in our classroom?\nLater on, Pink draws on Csikszentmihalyi’s insights on ‘Flow’ (p. 115). Csikszentmihalyi’s research showed that most tasks where people achieved ‘Flow’ shared three key elements: a) there were clear goals, b) there was immediate feedback and c) the task difficulty level was perfectly pitched – slightly higher than the performer’s current level. The implications for task design here are obvious...\nIn discussing ‘extrinsic’ vs ‘intrinsic’ motivation, Pink points out that there is often a trade-off; extrinsic factors may work best in the short-term, but in the long run intrinsic motivation is always the winner! (p. 79) Back to ELT, exam classes illustrate this perfectly: granted, both parents and students often clamour for more exam-oriented material as there is always a test round the corner, but in the long run this is disastrous (I have yet to meet students who do CPE tests for fun after getting their certificate...)\nMotivation leads to ‘autonomy’ and this is where things get really exciting! On p. 86 we are introduced to the concept of ROWE (‘Results-Only Work Environment’). The idea is simple: your employer does not care how or when you do something, so long as you deliver the goods! Now imagine ROSE instead! Imagine a school where classes are not compulsory, where students are more autonomous and they have to actually generate something as evidence of learning (rather than sit endless tests). This is not a dream; the IB model has taken many steps in that direction...\nThen on p. 93 we go one step further still! Atlasian is a software company where once a week employees can do anything they want!! At the end of the day, employees just show what they have come up with. Now, can you imagine a school where once a week you can work on any project you want? Imagine being paid to design your favourite activities, to incorporate novel IT-based task in the syllabus or prepare worksheets for ‘Comedy for ELT’ sketches? Sheer bliss! :-)",
    "I was recommended to read this book, at the time I thought, to help me work out how to grow my business. I now realise that it was to help me figure out why I’d even want to do that. Sure I’ve got some ideas about what I’ll be pushing for over the next couple of years, but I also found out something way more important. We’re missing a huge opportunity to help our kids grow up into truly useful people, teaching them to jump through hoops with grades, and exams, even spending money, and chores. There’s so much more to go at, and they have that knowledge built in. Definitely a book that has helped me to reboot what I’m doing at work and home, with a load of good positive things that anyone can put into action.",
    "I don't read much at all - I was recommended to read this from my workplace, which embraces the vast majority of the philosophy outlined herein. I absolutely LOVE the culture where I work, so I took their advice and dove in to see how they ended up creating such a brilliant culture and work environment - I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe book walks you through various counter-intuitive insights into how people work depending on what their job is, and how to get the best out of them. It hammers home every point it makes with both scientific research studies, and case studies at well-known highly successful businesses where these methodologies have been thoroughly battle-tested.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoyed was the delivery - this book reminds you, and reinforces you of the points it is making. It seems to be have specifically written as an education tool, to help the reader really absorb the points it is making - I haven't read any of his other books yet, but I strongly suspect there is one in there about the best ways of learning; I feel like the writer knows exactly how to teach through written word.\n\nTo top it all off, there is a tool-kit at the end which gives examples of how to practically apply or implement the various teachings of the text.\n\nThis is simply a brilliant read, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",
    "I don’t often review the books I read, but with ‘Drive’ I felt I had to. Having worked in the ‘carrot and stick’ environment in my career, I can now see why I was never driven by monetary reward. I am definitely what Pink calls a ‘Type I’ person. Although I am retired now, I feel this book has made me a potentially better person as I have written myself a list of areas I want to master in my life.\nI recommend this book to anyone wanting more purpose in their life, but also and especially organisational leaders who are looking for more engagement from their employees."

    "This book is great. Makes accounting for non accountants easy to understand. Having my managers read it too",
    "This was exactly what I was looking for! The best financial book I've ever read for non-financial managers. It really helped my understanding of corporate finance. I think very helpful for a small business owner as well to understand their business and starting thinking like a big business when making important financial decisions. It's important to note that this is not an accounting book (as the authors stated) and details of charts of accounts are left out. That said, it was clearly stated what the purpose was and it nailed it. I've purchased the book for my son who is in college studying business and was confused by his professors - I think it will help him clear things up. I plan on buying more for my colleagues. As crazy as it sounds, it was hard to put down - I just kept wanting to read more as it explained all the voodoo finance so well. Every business owner, sales rep, manager or anyone wishing to understand how finance is used for decision making should buy this book.",
    "I do have a few years (decades) of experience in the field - and many moons ago I completed most of the coursework for Ph.d. in accounting before deciding academia was not where I wanted to be. I taught the subject at the University level for more than 5 years and now train on this subject internationally. My background also includes working as an auditor and many years wearing the corporate controllers hat. I say this because I want to make clear that this book is not just for beginners, or people without a background in the field.\n\nI recommend this book to everyone. Accounting and finance are not easy subjects especially if you jump in and start with the technical aspects of it. Put simply the better you understand the numbers - the better your business decisions will be. I view this book as providing an excellent foundation - the more you build your core knowledge of the subject the better. Remember the key in business is making better business decisions - don't be overly impressed by people who can spout GAAP at you with in terms you don't understand. The real experts can, and should, be able to translate the rules in a fashion that aids in understanding (1) why the rule is there in the first place, and (2) how it impacts you business and the decisions it makes.\n\nThis book is written in a fashion that will not put even non-accountants to sleep and it paints enough pictures with examples of accounting misdeeds to keep it interesting - and to really drive home how seemingly innocuous (in some cases) changes to how transactions are recorded and paint a very different picture of the health of an organization.\n\nIf you are in business / work - do yourself, your future and your business a favor by increasing your understanding of the numbers. This book is a great place to start....",
    "This book was absolutely amazing!\n\nI took about a year of accounting courses in college, but never quite learned the intricacies of financial statement analysis. I wanted to learn not only about corporate finance, but also how to analyze financial statements. Thus, my search was on.\n\nAfter researching book stores and reading forums online, I learned about this book, which I looked up on Amazon.com. I love books that get straight to the point, so when I saw that this book covered corporate financial management and financial statement analysis in under 300 pages, I was in!\n\nI purchased the book from Amazon and I read it in about two weeks. I literally could not put it down. The authors speak like human beings and actually make math and finance fun and interesting. In those two weeks alone, I not only gained a better understanding of accounting, but I learned how to evaluate investments and make management decisions based on company finances.\n\nThe book covers income statement analysis, balance sheet analysis, cash flow statement analysis, performance ratios, a bit of inventory management (like a financial intro to lean), and advanced capital expenditure analysis through concepts like discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nThis book took me from feeling like I'd never understand certain things, to being able to discuss finance like an executive manager.\n\nI'm not kidding either, the book dives straight in and explains everything in a no nonsense approach.\n\nFinancial Intelligence acted like a learning springboard for me by providing a foundation for me to read deeper into finance.\n\nI 100% recommend this book to anyone looking for a place to begin their finance studies.",
    "As a non-accountant with some basic financial knowledge, this book was just what I needed to boost my knowledge a bit further. Thank you.",
    "I'll start with what this book is NOT. It's not for anyone who intends to assume an accounting or finance function. And it's not for anyone looking to become an expert one myriad of rules that govern decisions made by accountants and finance team leads.\n\nThis book is for the manager or executive who needs just enough financial decision making chops to know where to look for the bodies, and which questions to ask. Magically the book manages not to be dry; a herculean feat for a book on this topic. Ultimately, It teaches how an individual skilled in the art of finance approaches problem solving. Which is exactly what you should be seeking to understand as a cross-functional leader in a modern organization.\n\nI'm recommending it to everyone on my team as a must-read.",
    "This book is an excellent précis of the world of Finance. Put simply, it explains how to understand the numbers and the basis of decisions that financial people need to make for accounting purposes.\n\nIt is very clear and easy to follow, ideal for beginners to the world of Finance, and perfect for anyone wishing to learn a little more about accounting.",
    "Haven’t finished the book yet but really enjoying it so far, it really gives you a strong grounding of what assumptions and estimates go into accounts and crucially what questions you should be asking. Don’t listen to reviews saying it’s boring, it’s finance! This book is engaging and interesting",
    "An excellent book that explains complex ideas and concepts very simply for non-accountants. I wish I'd read this when I was doing my MBA as it would have been a great primer for the finance and accounting modules. Currently reading it as a refresher and really enjoying it.",
    "I recommend this to anyone who wants a straightforward explanation of accounting and finance. Really easy to read and understand.",
    "I work in Finance and I found this book unbelievably useful to refresh my knowledge, as well as to learn stuff that I was never taught at school"

    "No complaints...all of my purchases have been as advertised, and arrived on time.",
    "I had to read this textbook for a Social Studies content course for my Masters in Secondary Education course. Overall, the process of UbD is a brilliant process that is helpful for many teachers. I think the tips that the textbook offers are great and can be helpful for all teachers. The only critique that I have for this textbook is that it is extremely wordy and they jazz up the language at times to make it seem more academic. It would be cool to have the authors write a series of UbD for the different content areas, so all the examples and frameworks would be directed for that specialty. I know that I would have loved to have more history or social studies examples.",
    "The book describes something common sense with the assumption that if designed correctly students will have better chance understanding--not just knowing and being able to recall but being able to transfer to apply etc. What is really understanding? Understanding itself is ambiguous and shall not and cannot be unified. The whole book is under the fallacy that understanding can be taught, the teachers' own understanding may not be adequate, correct or deep. It went into great details as how to accomplish the goal--desired learning results but it fails to realize that humans arrive and achieve understanding at different paces under different contexts or circumstances yet some never do. The intention is good but assumption is off. Using a surgical approach to learning won't bring the desired outcome--and thank god it does not.",
    "The book was easy to read and understand. I chose to buy the book instead of renting it so I can refer back to it in the future when I create learning materials.",
    "Definitely a must have for any educator. Wiggins and McTighe are almost the pioneers in this field and thought of backwards design (Robert Tyler first thought of the concept in his published work from 1947) and their concepts are easy to implement and are what I would call a no-brainer. As in it should be something that all teachers are already implementing in their lesson and unit planning already. However, we all know that it is not already in the forefront of every educators mind or else there would not be a need for this book. This book will definitely teach the educator or potential educator how to start to think about the goals of a lesson and then to plan the lessons on how to get each student to those specific goals (backwards design). It is an easy concept and once understood and fully grasped by the educator he/she can start to educate their students in a way in which the students will benefit by truly gaining meaningful knowledge from the course they are taking with the educator and be able to apply the knowledge and demonstrate understanding.",
    "This book covers an eminently critical topic in contemporary education practice -- developing curriculum that covers all the essential concepts in a course in an engaging and measurably effective manner. Wiggins and McTighe expertly present a lot of great material, both theoretical and practical to help teachers, administrators, schools, and districts to develop their own Understanding by Design units. No serious educator should be able to walk away from this book with nothing new to add to their pedagogical arsenal. Still despite its strengths, this book is very dense, so it's a slow (but worthwhile) read. It's also a bit ponderous in presentation style at times. The authors can be a bit long-winded at times, sometimes belaboring points too much. Still, despite minor flaws, this book is a very important work in modern education research that educators need to understand and practice to enhance the quality of student achievement in our schools today.",
    "Came in good condition. I needed it for my graduate class and it was perfect",
    "I had to buy this book for a course at Teachers College, Columbia University. It is an excellent text and guide.",
    "A really useful book on backward curriculum design. It encompasses a great deal of theory and research, but it is presented in an accessible style. This is a very useful book for any teacher or school leader devising a curriculum.",
    "Great pedagogy",
    "Well written and structured. A lot of useful information and insights. Well researched too.",
    "Masterpiece for those who want to learn how to create a course about teaching.",
    "As a new teacher this book provides lots of templates to use when planning. You don't have to read each chapter in depth unless there's something you want to expand on, the templates provide plenty of guidance."

    "An introductory book to the world of economics. Great writer.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to economics and the broad range of issues informed by economics for the non-professional but interested reader. It is clear and accessible and punctuated by a breezy, witty style, and without a single equation or graph for those terrified of numerical relationships. The economics presented in this book is mainstream economics as befitting a journalist for The Economist and makes points that would satisfy those right-of-center and those left-of-center. For conservatives, the author reminds us (like Milton Friedman did in \"Capitalism and Freedom\") that a heavily regimented economy would eventually come at a steep price in curtailed political / civil freedoms just to maintain the economic regimentation. In addition, the physical and human capital underlying productivity growth, and the economic self-interest that drives their application, are key components of economic well-being. On the other hand, liberals will appreciate his contention that government is a crucial catalyst for effective market functioning in that it provides (or can provide) a legal framework, a predictable regulatory regime, and a stable macroeconomic environment. Most of the national economic failures to which the author alludes are not the result of racial, ethnic, institutional, or cultural deficiencies but are simply a result of government incompetence and corruption (see Zimbabwe). And markets are not omniscient; we get the standard analysis for market prices not reflecting social costs / benefits (externalities) and the market's failure to produce public goods.\n\nWhat I also liked about this volume was the way in which it extended economic analysis to many areas of social / human behavior, but then would go no further, i.e., the author recognizes that economic analysis informs much of our public policy debates but cannot settle value-laden issues. For example, in his chapter on \"Productivity and Human Capital\", subtitled \"Why is Bill Gates so much richer than you\", he acknowledges that economics can tell us about the production of income and the creation of wealth, but can't really tell us how that income and wealth should be distributed. (Some prominent economists are on record as claiming that distribution issues are irrelevant.) This book maintains that these value-oriented issues are determined in the political process as shaped by our religious, moral, and cultural backgrounds.\n\nI enjoyed this book very much. But I would challenge the author on two points: (1) He asserts that social security is a \"pyramid scheme.\" While pay-as-you-go financing may superficially resemble a pyramid scheme, there are fundamental differences that any actuary at the SSA could tell you. Pyramid schemes are inherently unsustainable because of the geometric progression of the pool of investors. A pay-as-you-go system does not require increasing multiples of later-round investors but simply a stable relationship between workers and beneficiaries. Long-term economic growth and population growth would contribute to its sustainability. Our current problems refer to the demographic \"bulge\" of the baby-boomers which should disappear with their passing, (2) With regard to intellectual property (IP) the author (no surprise) comes down strongly for long-term protection for IP as an inducement to its creation, as opposed to less stringent protection that encourages the dissemination and use of IP. Obviously, there's a trade-off between creation and dissemination, but the current stress on protection may inhibit economic growth and innovation. How many firms pay (or refuse to pay and thus not use the IP) royalties for the use of \"patents\" that many would consider belong in the public domain? Do we really need copyright protection for 70 years after the author's death? Just one man's opinion.",
    "This is the first book that I read about Economics and I was surprised by all the things that it covered and how well explained were they, Charles Wheelan tried to create a book so even the person without the slightest knowledge of economics could read it and understand it, and as Burton Malkiel Said If I had wanted to write a book about Introduction to Economics, this is the book I'd have written.\n\nThe first chapters cover the nature of markets and how is it possible to have so much organizations in a decentralized economy, it's about satisfying consumer goods, there's a great story about a Soviet Commander who once entered an American Pharmacy and amazed by all the quantity of the stuff asked the pharmacist, impressing, but how does the goverment manages to supply all of this things to all the pharmacies, like they did in the USSR, the answer was, they don't, there's not a law that indicates which things a pharmacy must have yet they all have almost the same kind of things, read the book to get the rest of the info on that and much more, believe it or not, interesting and enjoyable stories.\n\nHe goes on to talk about How the financial system crashed by explaining how the financial system works and how the goverment did things it wasn't supposed to do, what the goverment can do and what it can't as opposed to the extremists who either want to get rid of the goverment completely or want it to control every aspect of our lives with detailed yet easy to understand explanaitions.\n\nLastly and one of my favorite parts as I live in a developing country is the part about International Trade and Development Economics, he goes on to explain that globalization is not as bad as the anti globalization protesters want you to believe or as they believe, he also tackles the asian sweatshops problem and how closing them would cause much more damage to the workers because capitalism is about choices and if they had a better working opportunity they as rational individuals would take it, but they don't because there are no better oportunities, obviously it has much more background than that, I just hope everyone read the book so we could unite to support the policies that help us all and stop the unrational prejudicing about things that benefit us all like Globalization and Free Trade.",
    "i read lots of popular economics books\nmy favourite is the 1946 classic ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON\n\ni have read many books since then. but it has never been outdone, or even parried. until now.\ni didn't know wheelan. and i certainly didn't agree with his centrist-leaning views.\nbut this really is a gem of a book. plain language, VERY entertaining prose, great examples, great research, good analogies.\nin short, highly recommended.",
    "Nice reading for those who've never studied economics - equivalent of economics for dummies. For everybody else it is just a pleasant reading that does not attempt explaining complex things but reminds you of some basic principles and illustrates them with anecdotal facts - make sure you double check the facts if you decide to use them as some of them are 'not entirely accurate'.",
    "Economics made easy",
    "A very great and entertaining read for absolute beginners such as myself. Will recommend this to all that want info.",
    "Fantastic book. Author writes really well and makes economics interesting and relevant. He also explains the most important concepts in a painless manner. No complicated maths. I have read a number of books on economics over the years and this is the one I would recommend if you want an introduction to economics."

Problem for me, Jeff was about 7 years away from birthing this book. Whether you're considering or in the midst of a life or career change, This book is for you. Or like me, someone who's been there and just needs a refresher or perhaps the opportunity to glean new knowledge, Get this book. Jeff knocked it out of the park again!",
    "Jeff tackles the difficult subject of transition. When do I know when it's time to leave the organization? When I am ready to leave what are some things to consider for my next move? These thought provoking questions that many are wrestling with addressed in the pages of this book. Jeff's personal writing style that is chock full of personal illustrations make this an easy read. His practical points and steps make application possible. Great Job Mr. Henderson this book is going to help a lot of people that are wondering \"What to do Next.\"",

    "As someone in transition, this book is transformational! So powerful and practical! Thanks Jeff.",
    "This book is perfect timing on many levels. I personally wish I had this book for myself about 2years ago, but as I went through this book I found myself making a list of people to purchase and gift a copy to. Too many to list here, but wishing I had deeper pockets for more gifts.\n\nThat all being said, there are so SOOOO many golden nuggets in the book. I'm not going to spoil that but I can say please PLEASE get your favorite drink, maybe a snack or two, hit the restroom, and plan on diving into some great wisdom at the right time. Rather you are looking, wanting, or needing to make a change, this book is for you. If you know someone who might be, this book is for you to gift to them.

It's not a must read, it's an absolutely HAVE TO HAVE!!! Thank you Jeff!!!!",
    "I enjoyed the insight Jeff used and provided in this book when he made his transition to form his own company. This book is a how-to book written by someone who has lived out all the steps that are provided. I bought this book through Audible, and I was glad to hear Jeff narrate as well.\n\nYou will enjoy this book and it will help you. No matter if you’re twenty something and just starting out, or late in your career and looking to make a transition. It’s a great book. Thank you, Jeff!"

    "I am not really sure that 5 stars does this book justice. I have read numerous real estate investing and wealth building books over the years, but this book ranks right near the top of that list bar none. The book has incredible advice for not only investing in real estate but wealth building in general. I implemented several pieces of advice after reading this book and found it some of the best stuff I have ever done for my own wealth-building activities.\n\nHe walks you through all aspects of investing in real estate and covers many areas that other writers completely leave out or gloss over at best. For example, he has a whole section on building the right team. Once I started doing this my investing activities soared.\n\nHis teaching style in the book is phenomenal. He uses a variety of diagrams that illustrate his points with perfect clarity. The diagrams he uses to illustrate various principles are worth the price of the book alone, but there is so much more in the book in addition to that.\n\nI thought this was such an incredible book that I ordered a copy of the Audible version AFTER I read the physical copy because I knew that I missed stuff in the reading that once I heard it would reinforce the points in a way I might have missed the first time.\n\nIf you are interested in wealth building and real estate investing this book should be the very first purchase you make.",
    "This book will give you unlimited ideas on how best to make your real estate dreams come true. Well written and time tested!",
    "Book is great, IMO, if you are new to investing, you are sitting on or about to sit on a lot of money, or dream about investing in real estate. Its great pep-talk material and the models and theories are the very basic to thinking like an investor. You could actually bypass paying for a real estate investment class with this book. However you are still going to need to network, and get in with people who are in the business.\n\nMy personal experience:\n\nI got off to a great start and found a property priced well below market value. I used the worksheets in the book and everything looked great. In the end, lenders pretty much killed the deal because of my \"Debt to Income\" ratio. Even with the property 40% below market value, they didn't want to touch me, and I have excellent credit. Now figure this, even if I had enough income, another property would have certainly pushed my Debt to Income over and I would be done with getting more loans for buy and holds, for a long long time.\n\nEven with buy fix and sells, lenders want to see money in the bank. Even if you are getting that money back when the property sells, you still need to have it. This is most likely going to be the path you need to take when you first start out, and have little money. You can also buy a home, live in it, then rent it out. But again, you can only do that so many times before your debt to income catches up with you. Then comes the part of actually FINDING homes. Investors know how to do it, and they aren't excited to tell you how.\n\nRight now I am in networking mode. Its not easy as no one wants to trust a stranger. Esp a stranger with no money!",
    "Would definitely recommend for beginners, a little more meat and potatoes vs. the traditional Rich Dad path to entry in real estate. Provides a simple overview and mindset adjustment with mostly practical and simple techniques. I love that this book doesn’t have all the MLM / pay-to-play stuff you typically see in real estate. I gift this one to my friends who are just trying to get their heads wrapped around the “why” and “how” of my investment strategy.",
    "It’s a resourful book of course its based on one persons experience in real estate so its a good reference and has good content.",
    "Great read and so much valuable information. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in real estate investing or even to just improve their financial health. I normally fall asleep when I read in general. I couldn't put this one down once I started reading it. It's that captivating.\n\nYou'll find both high level and in many cases details of how to approach certain aspects of real estate investing. Many people commented that it's too theoretical. I think it is in many respects. But there are certainly some things in it that are very practical, especially the advise from the millionaires he interviewed. That's all practical advise and not theory.\nMost importantly, you'll learn how to think like a wealthy person. Notice, I didn't say like a rich person. That's where the fundamental difference is between the two. I never made that distinction until I read this book. It has opened my eyes. Had I known what I''ve read in this book 20yrs ago or even 10yrs ago, I'd be 10 times richer today.Just the idea of tracking your networth is worth a load of money.\n\nNote: This is my first book on real estate investing. I bought it with the intention of starting to invest soon. I got so much encouragement from reading this book that I hope to pull the trigger on investing in real estate. I'll come back and update my review hopefully in a year or two and give an update.\nEnjoy and good luck!",
    "I only realised halfway through this book that it was written in 2005 - before the housing market crashed!\nI wonder how many of the millionaire investors he quotes got burned after assuming house prices will continue to go up and up?\n\nThe book needs to be updated.\nI wonder if it hasn’t been updated because he quit real estate after the crash.\nA pre-2007 book on housing is useful for interest only. DONT use it as a business plan.\nHe talks about house prices rises 1980-2002 and remortgaging as the prices increase, but never talks of the possibility of them slowing or dipping. Seriously I guarantee of lot of these investors went bankrupt.\nThat said, the points he makes does seem logical, however I’m giving it one star as nobody should use this a a business plan!",
    "all good, great value, thank you",
    "A really good book with (and written by) people who have done - a good starter as it does go into to much detail but points you in the right direction to start!",

    "Like ‘word of the day’, but a short story with a ‘thought for the day’. Repetitive but not terrible reminders ….\n\n1Jan- Discover your calling\n2 Jan - Reconnect with your childhood obsession\n3Jan- Voice…do something today you loved doing as a kid\n4Jan -already within you…ask someone who recalls your childhood what you were interested in\n5Jan - Know what you’re drawn to and immerse yourself in it\n15Jan- let a sense of purpose guide you\n\n3 stars because some of these can be useful reminders (which I did enjoy), but the book seems unnecessarily drawn out / motivated to be a ‘one a day’ format. The original books (Power, Mastery) were much better (not great, but better)…\n\nIf you’re interested in these type of books, you may also enjoy Richard Templar’s Rules of Work (another quick/ light read). Alternatively- one I found surprising was ‘The Turnaround’ by Darrin Donnelly which is sports focused, but contains a few gold nuggets - mainly about mindset.\n\nEither way, any time you spend on self improvement is never wasted and even if you only get a few takeaways from this book, it’s still worthwhile and you’re probably doing better than your peers. Happy reading!",

    " A MUST HAVE in your library. “The Daily Laws,” are filled with gems of wisdom that help you look within and challenges you to “Look wider and Think Further Ahead.” The subtitles for everyday motivates me and ignites me to immerse myself in the details of my purpose my goals. Love his daily law on March 10th, “KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS PROGRESSING. Don’t let your ego fool you. You are always knowledge’s inferior.”\n\nThought provoking awe inspiring book. Robert Greene never disappoints.\n\nThis book is a marvelous addition to the collections of other Robert Greene books in your library and if this is a first book for you then a hardy congratulations. Buy it and thank me later. ☺️💙",
    "As all his other books are quite large this is great to dip into to reinforce the wisdom therein.\nI have read all his books apart from the 50 cent one and they are fantastic!\nThis is good for a recap and brilliant for a starting point.",
    "I love the layout of this book and it's bitsize wisdom hits.\nRobert Green has managed to take some vary insightful and fundamental principles of human nature and served it up into a relatable context.\nI have read many of Robert Greens books 📚 and learnt soo much about dealing with the underlying motivations in both myself and other people. Knowledge is only power if you know how to apply it. Robert Green uses historical context in order to highlight how certain people play the game of thrones. This is what makes this book so interesting and the information so applicable. A book for the pragmatic people who do not wish to be played. Lots of different approaches are used in this book from seeking greatness through hard work and forcus too learning how to deal with underhand tactics.All in bitsize chunks that even the busiest brains can find time to reflect upon.",
    "I love the book. I am still on page 26 and I began to realize things I should do in life. Credits to Robert Greene for writing this wonderful book. A must read book daily. You read, reread and learn book.",

    "This is a fantastic book if you’re just starting out in management or have been at it for a while and need a refresher on some aspects of people management",
    "This book is great for managers/leaders in any organization and I highly recommend it. Contrary to what one reviewer said - it is not outdated. Good advice is never outdated. I am an attorney who moved into HR two years ago and I could have written this book. It provides the same sage advice I've been giving managers and leaders for over 30 years - if followed, it will reduce legal action AND lead to more engaged and happy employees who are less likely to leave the organization. The managers/leaders will likely be happier and less stressed too. In my experience, I see far more bad and/or mediocre managers/leaders than truly good ones. This book can help change that - for the reader who is willing to learn and change behaviors. Good management and leadership is not an innate talent for the majority of people - it can and should be learned by EVERY manager/leader not just the new ones. Even those with innate talent and good emotional intelligence can learn something from this book.",
    "I am reading this book currently. The information is exactly what I need to know becoming a supervisor.",
    "I read this book after being a group leader for 2 years and shortly before becoming a manager of my department. I have experienced a large portion of what the authors say you will go through as a people manager and have gained a lot of incite as to what to expect in my next role. I recommend this book to any new manager or aspiring manager.",
    "This was exactly what I was looking for and needed! Simple but powerful.",
    "Recommendations are practical and right on the point.",
    "So far this book is good. It’s funny cause I feel like I already know a lot of the content just from life experience and education. It’s a good thing! But I am marking the ideas that I find helpful or intriguing so that I can refer back to those ideas once in a while! Excited to start my new career",
    "I've been listening for a couple of hours... and the number of times the frame of reference flips from first time manager to division executive is astonishing. Can only hope that a person running a department or an entire division of a company is not also... a First Time Manager.\n\nThe info is outdated as is the delivery and a lot of it is just considered tone deaf or wrong at this point. The condescension flips from new new manager themselves (who's colleagues are green with envy, apparently) to the subordinants who hate them. I admit that I read a lot about the subject of leadership and I've never returned a book.\n\nUntil today. Essentially the authors are covering too much ground and the discussion of the teamwork this book took to compile seems to miss the concept that if you don't \"come together in consensus\" it makes a mess... this is a mess.\n\nDo not recommend it.\nGiant list of much better, much more contemporary work.\nI vow to dig deeper next time before I pull the trigger.\n\nThanks for that one lesson folks.",
    "The book addresses the needs of new managers and it does a very good job at point out the most common mistakes new managers make and how to avoid them.\n\nBut it's useful to managers who change jobs, companies and cultures as well. Sometimes the shift is so big that it you feel like a newbie on the job; and this is a moment when this book helps, too.",
    "If you’re starting is a new manager I would say this book will help you a lot In many situations.You also will find some practical stuff which you can use really easily and understand",
    "I bought it as a present and unfortunately cover is damaged.",
    "I purchased this book for 2 of my employees who have recently been promoted to Management roles. They are only about half way through at this time but the feedback is that this book is amazing! It covers everything and more that a first time Manager needs to learn and know. My pick of choosing this book for them was an optimal pick on my part! 😃",
    "Purchased for becoming a first time manager and book is super easy to read and was super helpful in developing skills. A must read for new and experienced managers!"

    "Need or would like some straight forward, no BS motivation that every word read will make you hold yourself accountable, this is the book.\n\nThe way it is written, allows for an easy read; above all, it rewards like Jock is actually speaking with you. I have bought this book for friends that asked for a reference on leadership, accountability and just plain ole a literary kick in the rear type book. It’s a must have.",
    "amazing writter he will change your life!",
    "It's a lifestyle guideline not a book.",
    "Awesome book, love how it was made. I got the hard cover, which I recommend!",
    "Jocko keeps it real and doesn’t mince words. I read this book in one day and it provided some helpful wisdom to share with my sons.",
    "Great quality and wisdom.\nDefinitely recommend.",
    "This review is for the hardcover \"Mk1-MOD1\" edition. In short, this is a miniature coffee table book of aphorisms (or short quotes). If that's not what you're looking for, look elsewhere. Jocko has some novel-length training manuals if you want those. This book is very visual, so it's not good in a Kindle edition. Get it hardcover, or not at all.\n\nSo what is \"Discipline Equal Freedom\"? It's a semi-pocket-sized tome of motivation. The idea is to present Jocko's core ideals in a digestible form. Jocko blends stoicism and American patriotism into a some ultra-powerful quips. Things like, \"Step. Step. Go. Now.\" or \"YOU WILL WIN\". Jocko's hope is clearly that if you read two pages of aphorisms, set the book down, and never pick it up again because you're busy changing your life, that would be \"GOOD.\"\n\nBut what is it really? It's black and white. Jocko likes monochrome. You end up with a lot of white on gray, gray on black, and so on. This means the book is not always super high contrast, and that's a challenge for some people. For the average person though it's perfectly readable. It's often white text on a black-and-white photo of something motivational, like Jocko's home gym covered in sweat after a workout. The words are simple and direct. Jocko says why he's doing this in the first pages, and the rest of the book is just supplemental material to the central point - basically, own your life own. Don't wait. Go.\n\nThe mk1 edition, if I'm remembering the first printing correctly, seems to have some more readable contrast throughout. It seems like there were some tweaks. There is supposed to be extra content too, but without having them side-by-side I can't really tell the impact. The important thing to me is that I wanted this book, and this is the best edition as of writing.\n\nSo it's 247 pages of aphorisms. A picture of Jocko, with words telling you to work out and eat right. I like it. If you need further details, there's plenty of references on what to do on Jocko's podcast and in his other books. He even makes a series of kids books, so his material can suit people of any age. But this book is clearly targeting his adult audience, and people who need some quick pick-me-ups. If you'd like to be able to thumb open a page, and read Jocko telling you to \"Grab time by the throat\" this is the book for you. Recommended.",
    "Inspirational. Written in a nontraditional way as others have said so I consider this a coffee table book.",
    "Zuerst - ungefähr bis zur Hälfte des Buches - war ich sehr angetan. Von der Diktion: mit Disziplin kannst Du alles erreichen. ALLES. Egal, was Du vorher durchgemacht oder mitgemacht hast, egal, was Du für Gene oder für eine Erziehung genossen hast. Von \"Ivy League Kids\" oder \"Silver Spooners\" bis hin zu \"Underdogs\" und \"Abused Children\" and \"everything inbetween\": mit dem entsprechenden Willen, Disziplin und Konsequenz ist es möglich, aus Dir den Menschen zu machen, der Du gerne sein möchtest. Bis zu einem bestimmten Grad stimme ich dem zu. Aber Jocko Willink ist sehr hart in seiner Konsequenz. JEDEN TAG (auch am Wochenende) wird um halb fünf aufgestanden und trainiert. Dafür muss man dann eben auch um 10 im Bett sein. JEDEN TAG. Nicht den Rhythmus unterbrechen. Das ist natürlich richtig (und auch nur ein Beispiel). Aber in seiner Konsequenz dann schon wieder nicht der menschlichen Natur entsprechend und klar, man kann natürlich davon abweichen und z.B. am Wochenende nicht trainieren. Oder nicht um halb fünf, sondern erst um halb sieben aufstehen. Aber dann ist man eben auch nicht so tough. Und ja, sein Kissen ist auch weich und seine Bettdecke ist auch warm und kuschelig, aber er kämpft nicht mit sich, ob er jetzt aufstehen soll oder doch lieber nicht. Er tut es einfach, fertig. Und da kannst Du auch hinkommen. Just do it. Ich bin dabei - grundsätzlich. Ich gehe auch gerne vor der Arbeit joggen. Aber nicht jeden Tag. Ich bin gerne diszipliniert. Aber nicht 24 Stunden am Tag. Ich esse den Donut, auch wenn ich weiß, dass er für meinen Körper nicht gut ist. Aber vielleicht in dem Moment für meine Seele? Wenn ich die Denke von Jocko Willink zu Ende denke und mir sein Beispiel als Maxime für das Leben aller nehme (frei nach Kants kategorischem Imperativ), dann kommen dabei nicht die Menschen raus, die ich um mich haben möchte. Das ist mehr so eine Art von Humanoiden. Für die Navy ist das sicher okay, dass man ultrahart gegenüber sich selber ist. Schnell, stark, diszipliniert. Und dass man es auch trainiert, alle paar Wochen oder so, für 72 Stunden ohne Nahrung zu sein. Ein SEAL sollte es schon anstreben, diese Fähigkeiten drauf zu haben. Aber außerhalb der Navy (oder vergleichbar) braucht man es eher nicht. MIR ist es FÜR MICH wichtiger, die richtige Balance zu finden zwischen Disziplin und Genuss. Aber \"Genuss\", wie er für die meisten Menschen (in meinem Umkreis) definiert ist, nämlich z.B. gutes Essen, ein Glas Wein dazu, die halbe Nacht mit Freunden zusammensitzen und dabei auch mal mehr als ein Glas zu trinken, zu palavern und sich ungeachtet der Uhrzeit aneinander zu freuen, das scheint bei ihm nicht stattzufinden. Zumindest läuft es gegen sein Disziplinkonzept. Wahrscheinlich hat er Freunde, ich will ihm gar nicht seine Persönlichkeit madig machen. Aber mit denen interagiert er dann vielleicht nicht auf die mir vertraute Weise, vermutlich jedenfalls. MIR IST ES ZU VIEL. Ich bin kein Seal. Ich werde auch keiner.",
    "This book wastes no time and is straight to then point. If you’ve watched/ listened to JOCKO PODCAST then you’ll have noticed how the writing style matches how he speaks, making it very easy to read.\n\nEach page makes the point clearly and is concise. There’s no waffling or chapters that feel ‘empty’ like some other books.\n\nThe principles in this book are simple\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone, whether you’re in a slump, feeling lazy or are simply wanting to tackle your new years resolutions head on. this book is for you. GO GET IT.",
    "Jocko is a fantastic public speaker and inspirational figure. Some of his other books are definitely worth praising.\nThis one however doesn't have more substance than a motivational video on youtube. I don't want to be condescending, however just because he is an experienced Navi SEAL and influential figure, does not mean he understands nutrition and strength and conditioning protocols. The workouts in this book make no sense for any relevant goals and it's better to go on youtube and visit channels like Athlean X or Ryan Humiston for more adequate advice. In relation to the diet, it also is just your typical meathead approach to \"I kinda did it this way, so it must be good right?\".\n\nAs a qualified Nutritionist, Level 2 Fitness instructor and training PT, please do more research before following the nutritional and exercise guidance in this book. Other than that enjoy the read.",
    "I purchased a Kindle version and then a hard cover edition because I wanted the book to be in my library. This book is really inspiring and it helped me to get more control on my life. I know this book format and writing style won't work for everyone (check out other reviews) but it worked for me so giving it 5 stars.",
    "Not what I ecpected at all More like someone telling you off all the time No clear practical instructions Basically what everyone knows but need some guidence on how to put in practice which the book completely lacks"

    "While I am not a climate scientist, I did teach college chemistry for over 40 years from freshman to graduate chemistry. I've spent about 10 years trying to educate myself about climate change. I have read about 150 CC books (pro and con, at many levels), read countless articles and Wikipedia pages, watched endless videos and lectures (pro and con) on most aspects of CC. Anyone willing to put the work to understand the science will come away with a solid foundation of how climate change works after reading this book. The figures are helpful in understanding the discussions and there are problems at the end of every chapter, with some answers at the end. (picture of my book, read twice)\n\nThe first 7 chapters explain the science of climate change. If it's been awhile since you took science and math courses, this could be a bit challenging, but well worth it. The writing is clear and the author has many helpful examples. I had previously seen the atmospheric \"layers\" model, but the author took it one step beyond what I had studied (to \"n\" layers), and it greatly improved my understanding (though I had to read it 3 times to get there). He used our neighboring planets (Mercury, Venus and Mars) to show how it works in comparison to earth.\n\nDessler covers most CC aspects in a more quantitative way than many of the generic (and sometimes alarmist) books that are out there. He discusses temperature (recent and historical), electromagnetic radiation (wavelength and region of the electromagnetic spectrum), blackbody radiation, the Stephen-Boltzmann law, energy balance, what the greenhouse gases are, the carbon cycle (atmosphere, land and oceans), how CO2 gets in the atmosphere (volcanoes, warming oceans and humans) and how it gets out of the atmosphere (weathering by land, oceans and photosynthesis), time lags between those two directions, radiative forcing, climate sensitivity, fast and slow feedbacks, plate tectonics, the solar constant and how it varies with earth's orbit (Milankovitch cycles). other greenhouse gases and more.\n\nUsing this foundation, Dessler looks considers Predictions of Future Climate Change, using different emission scenarios (Chapter 8) and Impacts of Climate Change, impacts on our world (Chapter 9), depending on what we do.\n\nChapter 10 looks at our poor understanding of the power of exponential functions, discounting, the discount rate and the social cost of carbon. Some of this was new to me and it's quantitative so I had to read it over about a few times. It considers whether we should invest our money up front (cough up the money to make the necessary changes) or wait and invest later as the emergencies arise (transfer the costs to the next generations).\n\nThe next two chapters (11 and 12) consider policies we can implement to try and save ourselves (adaptation, mitigation, various geoengineering strategies and economic strategies to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels = fees versus cap and trade, conventional regulations versus market regulations versus voluntary strategies, etc).\n\nChapter 13 was historical background on science and politics. I was familiar with much of this information, but it was helpful to see it all summarized in a few pages.\n\nThe last chapter (14) looks at the uncertainties involved in CC, deciding a long term goal, costs versus benefits, the IPCC goals of 1.5oC and 2oC (and their carbon budgets), what we need to do to achieve those targets, how much it could cost, elements of a coherent policy and some final thoughts.\n\nThis is really a comprehensive book for anyone who is not an expert on CC. If you have some background, this book can bring it all together, provide a really good overview and deepen your understanding of CC. If you are just beginning your quest to understand CC, you'll have to work harder, but this is still a shortcut to deep understanding (rather than reading the information scattered over 20 different books on different aspects of CC).\n\nMy 10 year quest has convinced me there is no other topic more important to the future of life on earth than how our climate is changing and what our options are. This is not a novel about climate change, it is a textbook written at a level that you can teach yourself how climate change works, IF you have a basic understanding of algebra level math and high school level science. It's worth the effort. Our future and our children's, grandchildren's and great grandchildren's future depends on what we do right now!",
    "It was not made clear that this was a rental. I brought this book as a gift for my neice and now i have to get it back from her to try to get it back to you.",
    "Two things struck me about the book:\n\n1. He claims that 60 cm of sea level rise would inundate 9% of Florida containing almost two million people. Following his reference to its reference, the area is for 80 cm not 60 cm. Checking its flood map against a population density map of Florida, the area shown, at the southern end of Florida, contains almost nobody — Miami is low, but not that low. Dessler is either incompetent or a deliberate liar.\n\n2. His chapter on the effects of climate change contains no positive effects — the only reference to any I could find consisted of two sentences early in the book conceding that there might be some in some regions. The book never mentions CO2 fertilization, which is a direct result of increased CO2, very well established by experiment, and large — doubling CO2 increases the yield of most crops by about 30%. It never mentions the increase in the area of Earth warm enough for human habitation. Part of one sentence, not in the chapter on effects, mentions the reduction in cold weather mortality, with no suggestion of the fact that mortality from cold at present is much larger than from heat or the fact, clear from both physics and the IPCC report, that greenhouse gas warming is greater in cold times and places than in warm.\n\nThe book is competently written but it presents a badly biased, and in part dishonest, picture.",
    "I got a Kindle sample because the author has a PhD in a relevant area. I was looking for science since I am an engineer PhD. I got to page 626 and I found the tropics, which he claims are conveniently defined as the region between 30 deg N and 30 deg S, and this region covers half the surface area of the planet. Now given all the bad information being dissent recently, I wanted to check this claim out. So I did a search on DuckDuckGo and never found anything about what percentage of the earth’s surface was in the tropics. But what I did find was a scientific definition which was approximately +/- 24 degrees. Now I am an Astronautical Engineer, and I am trying to learn if climate change has scientific backing, but making so egregious error seems inexcusable. I am glad that I did not buy this book! I would not recommended it to anyone.",
    "Watched interviews with Steve Koonin and then Desseler back to back on Rogan. Desseler came across to me as a salesman for solar and wind and lost me when he declared humans 100% responsible for warming. He kept painting Dr. Koonin as a defense attorney for carbon when all he does is ask questions that they have no reasonable answers to, yet we're supposed be alarmed and rush to change everything at a cost which we do not know. I'll keep my $40 and wait 10 years and see.",
    "This does exactly what it says on the cover: it is a clear and up to date introduction to our changing climate, and at undergraduate geography level. It is well written and supported up by good scientific plots. Dessler constructs a simple energy balance model, discusses carbon cycling and shows why the only sensible answer to the question “why is the climate changing” is that it is a result of human impacts. He then summarizes with some useful graphics some of the key impacts so far. Particularly striking for me was a plot of property values against time for a house in Houston TX, that was flooded twice – one massive flooding event didn’t alter the value too much, but the second massive flood caused the value to crash (Figure 9.5 if you’re interested).\n\nThe last 1/3 of the book is a very useful introduction to climate change policy through adaptation and mitigation including economic regulation and geoengineering. There is also a good chapter on the history of climate science and politics which explains how we have arrived where we are.\n\nI am a climate scientist and I like how Dessler finishes the book, “I do not know what the future holds. But I do know that, if we are going to navigate the coupled problems of energy and climate, we are going to need people like you to get involved in all parts of the problem: The political, the economic and the scientific. Given the enormous creativity and inventiveness of humans, there is no question that we can solve the problem. I encourage you to get involved and ensure that we do.”",
    "Il libro è molto interessante. Peccato che sia stampato in bianco e nero.\nDalle foto delle altre recensioni noto invece che dovrebbe essere a colori. Le didascalie dei grafici fanno infatti riferimento a colori ma essendo in bianco e nero non è possibile distinguere.",
    "モノクロなので、図、特にグラフの項目が特定できないものがあります。カラーではないことが表記されていれば購入していませんでした。テキストは科学から政策・現状についてよく解説しています。"

    "This book is VERY good. One of the best nonfiction books I've ever read (I’ve lost count, probably over 1,000 books).\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that there are some cons, and as usual, I'll start with them.\n\nCONS\n1. The Flaw\n\nThe main con of the book is a piece of absolute, utter hogwash that simply doesn't fit this awesome book. One of the chapters is titled \"Emotions Build Habits.\"\n\nIn the very same chapter there is a sentence:\n\"For too long people have believed the old myth that repetition creates habits.\"\n\nBJ Fogg champions the idea that your attitude is more important than consistency. And he does it in an ugly style, which is another con.\n\nI know where he comes from. Millions of people have forced themselves to follow some diet for a month or a quarter-year, and then they abandoned it and never came back. Repetitions alone don't create a habit. But tens of millions of people have felt very excited about changing their habits, didn't force themselves, weren't consistent, and ended up without a habit in the exact same way.\n\nRepetitions alone aren't a silver bullet. Emotions alone aren't a silver bullet either.\n\nIn fact, Fogg contradicts himself, teaching his readers in the next chapter to rehearse their tiny habits. If repetitions don't build a habit, why rehearse? You should just \"feel good\" about the idea of having a habit and it will magically form. Sheesh!\n\nI found an ideal sentence describing what the author meant, the one which I agree 101% with:\n\n\"Emotions make behavior more automatic.\"\n\nThis is the main focus of this chapter, and deriding repetitions, tracking, and streaks was a huge mistake and throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n\n2. Zealotry\n\nI don't think any author is free of this. BJ Fogg’s ideas are truly brilliant, but stating some utterances like they are dogma tickles me in a bad way.\n\nI noticed it only once in the book, but it left a foul taste. It was in the fragment about repetitions:\n\n\"Some of today's popular habit bloggers still talk about repetition or frequency as the key. Just know this: They are recycling old ideas. They have not done groundbreaking research.\"\n\nThrowing the baby out with the bathwater and pretending it's a good thing to commit.\n\nFirst, this paragraph was totally unnecessary. Second, in my ears \"groundbreaking research\" equals inerrancy and people who haven't done such research are inferior. How come?\n\nThose “popular bloggers” don't just spill their words on the internet. They write from experience. I’ve coached over 100 people in habit formation, and I did it according to BJ Fogg's model. Repetition works. Period.\n\nThen you can add some qualifiers: that it doesn't work alone or that if your emotions are working against you it's very hard to create a habit despite repetitions.\n\nBut in general, repetitions work, hence the author's own advice to rehearse your habits.\n\nDon't get me wrong. You may think after this con that the author is some kind of self-righteous monster. That's far from the truth. BJ Fogg is an awesome guy. I've been following him for years.\nHis accomplishments are undeniable.\nHe has great bragging rights.\n\nI simply say belittling others is not his style and it doesn't fit this awesome book. The same with fighting timeless concepts that have been proven to work in practice countless times.\n\n3. Celebration\n\nThis is my biggest takeaway from the whole book. I bought Tiny Habits to repay BJ Fogg for his awesome job.\n\nI've already studied the concept of tiny habits. I went through his free course with success. I've been writing about his concepts for several years. Apart from very interesting stories about the author and his clients and students, there was nothing new in the book for me.\n\nExcept for celebration, that is.\n\nI mean, when I did the Tiny Habits course a few years ago, I read about celebration and I discounted it. I never truly implemented this element into my habit development or my coaching. Big mistake.\n\nWhy did I put it as a con? Because it's articulated in the book only halfway into it!!\n\nWhat is more, the author is clearly aware of the importance of featuring this tip:\n\n\"I would train you in celebrations before teaching you about the Fogg Behavior Model, or the power of simplicity, or Anchors, or recipes for Tiny Habits.\"\n\nSo, why the heck didn't he?!?!\n\nBJ Fogg knows it's important. For a habit expert like me, it's the biggest takeaway. And he hid this feature in the middle of the book.\n\n4. Typo\n\nThe last con is on the publisher. English is not my first language. I'm unaware of most grammatical errors. I usually am not annoyed by a few typos here and there. I'm an author, and I know how close to impossible it is to eliminate all typos from a manuscript.\n\nThat is, until I read \"bestto\" in a Kindle book for which I paid almost $17! And I know that a poor author won't get even $5 of it because he is robbed by a traditional publisher whose products are so perfect, and so above the \"poor quality\" self-publishers' books (like 5x above, as their prices are).\n\nC'mon! My word processor noticed this typo! Drop the price to a reasonable level, or do the perfect job you are paid for.\n\nRant over! Sorry.\n\n==========\nIf you've thought for a moment that the above cons make Tiny Habits hardly readable or the book is not so good, that's a wrong impression.\n\nI wrote in such length about cons because I deeply care about this book's success. It is absolutely fantastic. And here are the reasons that make it so:\n\nPROS\n1. Fogg Behavior Model\n\nThis is a brilliant concept, and it deserves to be taught in primary school. In the first grade of primary school.\n\nIt's simple. It's intuitive. It isn't an academic theory, but it describes reality because it is based on observations more than on ruminations.\n\nThe chart of the model and several sentences explaining how it works are worth the price of the book, and the typo be damned.\n\n2. Covers All the Angles\n\nTiny Habits tells the whole story of habits, from underlying principles of repeating the behavior to breaking bad habits and group cooperation in developing new habits.\n\nThis is the MOST complete book about habits I've read, and I read them all.\n\nRead this book and you will learn how people actually change their behavior, why it makes tremendous sense to start small rather than big, how to grow your tiny habits into massive action, and how those small activities will result in huge results in the end.\n\nI love this book! It says all I've been trying to convey to the public for years. It also says it very well. The explanations are easy to grasp. Tiny Habits is very well written. Which is the next pro...\n\n3. Stories\n\nI was totally impressed by the way BJ has woven stories of his students into the principles he teaches. I barely can tell where teaching ends and a story starts.\n\nAnd all the stories are amazingly powerful. BJ has taught tens of thousands of people how to develop habits; he could cherry-pick some that make your head spin and your heart rate climb.\n\nPowerful. Encouraging. Hope-giving. Authentic.\n\nBJ Fogg has done something extraordinary in this book. He’s connected miniscule daily actions with big life transformations. What we mostly see in media are the stories of great deeds: losing 100 pounds in three months, creating a six-figure company in less than six months, etc. Tiny daily activities simply don't connote with enormous transformations.\n\nUntil you read Tiny Habits. Utilizing the stories is at the master level here.\n\n4. Repetitive\nRepetition is the mother of learning.\nRepetition is the mother of learning.\nRepetition is the mother of learning.\n\nBJ Fogg seems to know this very well. There is a lot of iterative repetitions of everything he teaches in the book.\n\nYet, it's not annoying at all. I noticed the repetition often, especially in the charts and images illustrating the process, but it didn't bother me one bit. I'm impressed.\n\n5. Personal\n\nI hate the guts of most traditionally published books. They are bland, tailored to speak to a general audience, and...bland.\n\nTiny Habits is not so. The author wasn't castrated out of his voice. BJ Fogg shares in by-the-way matters that he is gay at the very beginning of the book. He shares plenty of smaller stories from his life related to habit building and behavior design. I enjoyed those tidbits a lot.\n\nBut he also shares the deeply personal story of his nephew’s suicide and his family dynamics.\n\nSo, a reader can not only learn from practical applications of his model and tiny habit framework from his example, but can relate to him on a personal level.\n\nTiny Habits is a lot of things, but it's not bland.\n\n6. Group Setting\n\nAnother unique trait of Tiny Habits is that it teaches how to create new habits in a group setting—in a family, company, or team. In the same methodical way in which the author explains how to build individual habits, he also explains how you can help others change.\n\nWhat is more, he describes two paths: the path of a Ringleader and the path of a Ninja. The Ringleader is a person with the authority to lead others (father, CEO, manager, coach, and so on).\n\nBut when people resist the change despite your formal authority or if you are not a person in power, you can still help others by walking the Ninja path. Which, by the way, I found very helpful. Most people hiss at the sound of the word \"change\" like a devil at the sight of holy water.\n\nSummary\n\nTiny Habits is so good that I cannot properly articulate it. Just ignore the one idiocy that emotions build habits and repetitions don't, and you can absorb the rest with your whole mind and soul.\n\nThis is the book that explains everything about habits.\n\nThis is the book that teaches you the simplest system.\nThis is the book that makes your personal changes not only possible, but totally doable.\nThis is the book that inspires you to take bold (but tiny!) action.\nThis is the book that helps you feel successful from day one.\nThis is the book.",
    "I've always been a very undisciplined person. In fact, I've been trying to \"overcome my bad habits\" for 60 years, including reading every book about habits I could find. Atomic Habits had been my favorite, but it was so complicated, I couldn't pull it off. Well, this book has finally helped me figure out how to do it! B.J. Fogg is officially my hero. I did the exercises as I read the book and by the time I was finished, I was getting up earlier and actually jumping out of bed, doing a Yoga routine before bed and using that teeth-whitener that I had bought 8 months earlier but never used. Since then, I've started exercising every day, drinking more water (I was drinking a 2-ltr diet Dr. Pepper a day), and sending several thank you cards a week, all habits I've wanted to create for years and years. Each week I add 3 more habits, but I can easily continue the ones I've been working on. I just can't believe how easy and fun it has been for me! This book is incredible!",
    "Unfortunately, now we have a class of individuals , who are taught they are capable of greatness with no roadmap. They are the recipients of the participation trophy. It is bad not because they participated, but because that is the limits of their horizons.Tiny habits allows for “ shine “. These parents foster mediocrity. I believe as does the Author that to whom much has been given, much is expected! It is a parental duty to ascertain and perhaps guide.\n\nThis book doesn’t and I believe shouldn’t address core principals. It is a change primer. What principles are to be aspired to is an individual, parent, religion guided aspiration.\n\nThis book demonstrates a process. It is a way of approaching behaviors, not a bible on values. The author correctly asserts the lessons can be used for good or ill. Use it wisely. It is individually focused. You do not need politicians or unlimited resources.\n\nRead the book! It is not a time waster, but should present the reader with possibilities.",
    "Finally something practical for someone who wants to be better. I’m planning to keep this book. Reread it so I can applied the teachings found in this book. Thanks B.J. Fogg for being honest and sharing. Best of luck to you.",
    "I discovered Tiny Habits several years ago and followed BJ’s methods to start new habits. They worked. First time ever that I actually got results from a book. I was so interested that I became certified in the Tiny Habits methodology and subsequently a certified coach through the Human Potential Institute.",
    "You won't be the same person after you read this book. It has made me more efficient, effective, and in control of my life. Things I now do regularly because of what I learned from Dr. Fogg: exercise daily (every day unless I have a major illness), floss daily, take my vitamins, and put on sun screen... It's so empowering.",
    "Tiny Habits is a culmination of Dr. Fogg's research in his lab at Stanford University. Now associated with the Medical School at Stanford University, Dr. Fogg continues his research and validation of the material found in this book. One of my most widely used reference books and easy to read.",
    "I loved these sellers! They had prompt perfect delivery and the book is in perfect shape! Thank you!",
    "A friend of mine Lori Hammond recommended this book, I'm 75 and enjoy reading anything about mind changing. Well I have been educated within the 1st chapter, we're in lock down due to covid19 so needed a little distraction, try 2 press ups after you visit the bathroom well at my age its frequent, I tried it not easy so I tried easy press ups (kneeling) managed them, got to about 20 a day easy! 8 weeks later I'm at 250 a day feeling fantastic and enjoying doing them. This alone was so worth buying the book, so much more to learn from Dr Fogg.",
    "I'd heard of Tiny Habits before. I don't remember exactly when, but I've seen references to it through lots of other productivity sites or books about habits, including (I think) 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. I've read so much on habit building and felt like I'd seen it all before -- info about breaking things down into smaller tasks, about rewards, etc. But I've never been able to get stuff to stick despite feeling like I knew it all. It was starting to feel like I'd just always be stuck doing the same things forever and ever.\n\nI bought TH on a whim despite a little part of me thinking it would be what I already knew, repackaged. It wasn't, as I quickly found out and read the whole thing in a day, lol (while making notes and thinking about my own habits). Lots of things in the book I hadn't seen before, particularly the way the 'behaviour model' was illustrated and broken down. The approach to behavioural change is so straightforward and totally free of the kind of shame that comes from feeling like you're just 'too lazy' to do things 'right'. Tiny Habits, by its nature, encourages you to change your habits with small actions, which makes it accessible from the get go; you can learn something and put it into practice very quickly. The concept of celebrating after doing the tiniest action was novel to me, and in just considering that concept I felt something in me soften, somehow. I already feel warmer towards myself for doing small things like getting up to stretch. I've heard the phrase 'Feel proud just for breathing' but this really puts it into practice in a way that made sense to me. Plus, I'm a UX researcher so this gave me a lot to think about for my career too!\n\nThe anecdotes in the book were surprisingly emotional, as well, something that was unexpected but very welcome. I found myself almost tearing up a few times reading stories about people who were really struggling - with their relationships with their children, with their spouses, recovering from grief. Tiny Habits helped them, but what this book does well is really illustrate HOW these people started to turn their lives around, with only a small change that any normal person could do without superhuman levels of motivation or ability. We see how that change affected other things in their lives. It felt very real, and achievable, and something anyone else could do.\n\nI suppose having only had this book a few days, time will tell whether it helps me long-term and I'll see if I can update my review in a few months... But I think I've taken away a lot from it in a very short space of time :)",
    "I will write a review on Amazon.\n\nSince purchasing this book I have read it through twice and have created my own tiny habits which are now ingrained into my daily routine. I have also benefitted from the free 5-day email training programme, which reinforced my understanding of the Tiny Habits methodology/process.\n\nThe book has been written in a very easy to follow manner and is not written in a typical academic format. In the 10 chapters + Appendixes there are pictures and flow charts to help you navigate through the Fogg Behaviour Model and the process of Behaviour Design. BJ Fogg has over 10 years of research to back up his model and has trained 1000's of people worldwide in the Tiny Habits method of behaviour design.\n\nThere are other books out there that talk about creating habits which have been published before this one and have gained a lot of interest in the press. Don't be fooled - this is not just another book on habits. This book has been written by the leading-light at the forefront of behaviour design research.\n\nIn sum, this is the best book that I've read and digested in a long time. Bravo BJ Fogg.",
    "As a behavior change consultant, this was the most anticipated book of my career. I've found BJ's work to be transformative. Having a systematic approach to creating long-term change is a game changer.\n\nThe book packs decades of research and tens of thousands of hours of reflection into one digestible volume. I use tiny habits in every aspect of my life, from getting more exercise outside of work to helping people with diabetes manage their illness.\n\nBuy it, read it, digest it, apply it, and teach it to someone else. It'll make your life (and theirs) a whole lot simpler and more fulfilling.",
    "For someone who has all the best intentions but an incredibly busy life where I get tired, my motivation goes and I revert back to old habits this book is incredible. BJ Fogg takes the emotion and guess work out of forming positive habits that you stick to. Really simple, really easy and REALLY EFFECTIVE."

    "If you’re starting out as a solo, whether you’re a writer a lawyer a consultant, or whatever, Who Not How may be the most important book you can read if you want to have both a successful business and a successful life. Here’s why I think that’s true.\n\nMost people who go solo don’t start their business with bales of venture capital. Instead, we fund those first lean weeks or years with credit cards, second mortgages, and the forbearance of our friends. We’re lean by necessity.\n\nNaturally, in the beginning, we do just about everything ourselves. That’s good and necessary, but it can create a bad habit that’s reinforced by society.\n\nAmerican culture lauds individual achievement. In school, we’re graded individually. The virtue of self-reliance is high on our list. The problem is that to grow and prosper we need to break that habit of “self-reliance at any price” and quit trying to do it all.\n\nWhen we face a new challenge, the need for a new website, for example, we naturally ask, “how can I do this?” We spend time climbing a learning curve to get to an acceptable level of performance. Asking, “who could help me with this” or who can do this for me” can make our businesses more successful and our life more satisfying. Let me share two examples from my business.\n\nI have a virtual assistant. Her name is Brenda, and she does a variety of administrative tasks that I used to do myself. She does them better, more consistently, and more efficiently than I would. And the fact that she does them frees me up to do the things I do best and contribute most to the success of my business.\n\nAnother example. For years I did my bookkeeping. I learned bookkeeping for the first job I got after I left the Marines. I did OK with a paper-based system. But I decided that I wanted to take advantage of what technology had made possible, so I bought QuickBooks. First, I tried to master it. The bookkeeping part wasn’t a problem. But learning about and implementing the automated functions of the program frustrated me. \n\nWhen I realized what was happening, I engaged a QuickBooks consultant to help me set the program up and review my books every quarter. The result: I used to spend frustrating hours not getting things quite right. Now, I spend about 15 minutes a day and an hour at the end of the month on my accounting.\n\nBoth Brenda and my QuickBooks consultant do things that I’m capable of. But they do them better, and, because they do them, I have more time and bandwidth to spend on coaching people as they write their books. That’s what I’m good at and what I get paid for. And using others for those tasks frees up time for me to spend on recreation, recovery, and relationships. Those things make life sweet.\n\nIf you’re a solo, that’s why you should buy Who Not How, read it, and put it to work. I suggest you buy the audio version, even if you also buy a print or ebook version. The audio version has some interviews with Dan Sullivan that don’t appear in the other versions. They will add value to your experience. \n\nIn a Nutshell\n\nIf you’re a solo, buy Who Not How: The Formula to Achieve Bigger Goals Through Accelerating Teamwork by Dan Sullivan and Benjamin Hardy Then read it and put the book’s lessons to work.",
    "I read this book after I heard it recommended on a podcast I listen to. The book has good information, but I found it to be repetitive which is why I only gave it 4 stars. However, it did help me to shift my mindset to focus on achieving bigger goals. Prior to reading it, I'd talked myself out of trying to do a lot of things because I didn't understand that I DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF. This book will inspire you to dream bigger and give you practical ways to achieve bigger goals.",
    "Haven't read it yet. Was introduced by Pastor. Very interesting title",
    "If you're procrastinating on something, it means that you were meant to hire someone to get it done for you.\n\nIn high school, one of my friends had a dad who said that if you had a problem money could solve, you didn't have a problem. He was an entrepreneur who retired for the first time while we were in high school, but he put himself back in the saddle because he wanted to work.\n\nI looked into the co-author who did most of the writing. He's well known on the Internet for his insights but doesn't have the 30 years of training entrepreneurs that Dan Sullivan does.\n\nI read halfway through the book and sort of stopped because I wasn't getting a lot of new stuff. And as I finished the second half, no real insights popped out. The first concept is given away at the beginning, and you don't have to thoroughly read the title.",
    "Who Not How is a game-changing mindset. Dan Sullivan is a leader of leaders and I am thankful this book got referred to me. I just finished my second read through and learned as much the second time as I did the first.",
    "I really disliked this book until I had gotten about 2/3 of the way through. I disliked the rest of it, BUT the concepts were so thought-provoking, that I have to give it a bunch of stars. For someone (like myself) who's been around the block a time or two to discover some deeper insights is pretty incredible. I still don't know if I agree with most or even some of what the book espouses, and I sure don't like the \"automatic\" and \"exponential\" blanket words, but I do know that it's given me lots of food for thought, and the investment in time is small, so go ahead and get it. Maybe it will agitate you like it did me.",
    "Just what I wanted",
    "Creating and leading a team have been a puzzle for me, to the point I feel inadequate to do it.\n\nReading this book helps me to internalize the dynamic is of human relationship, and the power and freedom it brings.\n\nAlso, give me clues on how to identify the right who, for any particular situation.\n\nI hope you enjoy this easy to read, but still insightful book, as I did.",
    "Working smarter, not harder is the essence of this book. Dan tells tons of stories of how people have efficiently achieved their personal and professional goals by collaborating with other people and feeling comfortable about asking for help, rather than just going it alone in a silo.\n\nPeople helping you with your high aspirations will also give you more freedom to relax, recover, do hobbies...which is important as Dan explains only \"16 percent of creative insight happens while you're at work. Instead, ideas generally come while you're at home or in transit, or during recreational activity.\"\n\nDan covers teamwork and leadership in detail talking about his winning formula of autonomy + goal/vision clarity + regular feedback = high performing teams.\n\n\"It all starts by setting a goal, a new bigger version of your own future. Then your next step is to ask, 'Who can help me do this?'\"\n\nIf you need some tips on how to reach bigger goals or you want to avoid procrastination, this is the book for you.",
    "I'm a big fan of the E-Myth approach to building a business, focused on building documentation, systems and processes to enable you to grow.\n\nThis book, however, has helped me overcome a growth hurdle in my business. It's not so much how the work gets done, but getting the right WHO'S to help me.\n\nThis Who, not How approach is a simple concept but really well laid out through stories and examples.\n\nI'd recommend this book to anyone looking to grow their business.",
    "Love the new transformative way of thinking that the author promotes in this book. Interesting take on your approach to goal setting and achieving. Would recommend highly for anyone seeking new insights in this area. The stories that the author uses are well used to bring evidence to the who not how concept. I have already recommended this book to a few of my friends and feel it is a must read for people who have lofty ambitions but seek a new perspective. I chose the rating of five stars because it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.",
    "I enjoyed ready this book. It's a concept that we all know but don't necessarily do that well. I'm looking forward to putting this teaching into practise. The stories to help bring it all to life were both interesting and inspirational for me. Thanks so much for collaborating and finishing the book!",
    "I do love Ben Hardy's work and Dan Sullivan separately. This book was recommended as I have a tendency to try to do everything myself, despite knowing the psychology behind why I should lean on other experts. Suffice to say, I am now backing myself and my talents and letting others shine at what there good at and I have got my long-standing business idea off the ground! Yippee! Great stories, based on good psychology and thought-provoking stories!"

Not to say my momma didn't try, she did. But this really is making things hit home for me and right now I am using this to teach it to my daughter for homeschooling. I just ordered my second book! If you are thinking about programs out there I highly recommend it as something you teach in the home. You and I both know public school will not do it, or will not do it right. This book and youtube are a god send! Best 20$ investment I think I have made in a while.",

I don't know if the answer they give me is wrong or if I am just missing something. I think there is not enough clear instructions. And if you run into a problem there is no resource to help you figure it out. I have spent way too much time pulling out my hair and trying to remain sane while working through this book.",
    "I order this workbook to provide a Basic Math Review to some of my High School Student. This workbook has excellent practice that shows step by step how to solve. At the end of the workbook you can find the answer key for all the lessons. This is the Basic Math that student are supposed to learn in elementary. Great support for those that never learn or need reinforcement."

    "Look closely at the red print across the top of the bookcover in this listing: \"This International Student Edition is for use outside of the U.S.\" Interesting that Amazon is selling this in the U.S. How many U.S. buyers are going to take it \"outside the U.S.\" before using it?\n\nIt's hard for us consumers to figure this stuff out. Is McGraw Hill being ripped off here? On the other hand, why are our homemade books cheaper for outsider use? Is McGraw Hill actually the perp, finding a way to increase sales volume? I used to think Amazon might care if some sort of ethics violation was in play, but I won't waste my time.\n\nBTW, it's a good book so far: well written overall and covers a lot of ground. McGraw Hill seems to have done a good job of editing (with the exception of \"comprised of ...\" on page 14). Most of the explanations are clear and to the point. Every now and then, after detailed explanations of entry-level stuff, they throw in higher-level jargon without definition, much less explanation. I guess that's par for the course. Were it not for the \"International\" label, I'd give it four or five stars.",

I am 45 but I feel like I have a very good grasp of my current investment strategies and also a plan moving forward into my 50s and 60s. I can’t recommend this book enough.

She writes just like she speaks; full of enthusiasm, animation and passion.

    "Dirge for the Drugsick\n\nBeth Macy, in writing RAISING LAZARUS, unwelcome vistas on the terrible contradictions facing us all. She is very near it all, with oceanic sympathy for those who suffer and die from opioids. This is not your typical methodically structured, chapter sacro-sanct narrative for people who want to put their thoughts in workable order when consciousness lands them in a patch of quandary. Rather it’s about many swamps if interconnected reasons to vomit and cry. One moment it is informative about statistics over the unkempt; then it is about the great sewer floating millionaire lawyers and judges that wring their well laundered profits from the bodies of the dead, near dead, and soon to be dead. Valiant knights of salvation stumble under overpasses, slipping on bodies still healthy enough to reach out a hand for a clean needle, or a stab of Suboxone to revive them doing overdose, or, for the shot for someone they know, which is denied them by the overdose savior because they will probably just hoard it for themselves. Churches gain in much needed reputation for handing out just enough to keep the drugsick in the same condition until they fall off the edge of caring about anybody or any thing flop-down dead. The narratrix moves between knotty anecdotes and often reconnects to the legal system that lives parasitically in the swamp of sewage, tries her best to peer into the air-conditioned morass ruled by the corporations who try to fashion and strangle self-control on their decades long cavalcades, cavilcades, to deposition, hearing and ruthless delay. Issues won’t settle until the money is gone or everyone is dead. Then for relief from civil tragedy, Beth steps back to reinforce the barriers to help with the tragic anecdotes, a never-ending tome, of real suffering, experience and side issues, such as the recrudescence and spread of HIV and the absolute doom fentanyl spreads as the drug sick sell it, for what to them are high profits, to more future victims who will listen and try.",
    "Many have detailed the drug crisis that is devastating America, but it’s good to see a book that promotes the heroes and the war they are fighting to save lives. This is too big of an issue to ignore and there are no simple answers. Glad to see a book that addresses the crisis in a personal and direct way.",
    "Many books have been written that focus on the opioid crisis and the destruction it creates across the country. Despite this, each new book feels like an endless tale of grief. This is one of the few books focusing on solutions and next steps- a blueprint for how to tackle the Pandora's Box of problems unleashed by the Sackler's.",
    "Raising Lazarus is a riveting follow up to the award winning Dopesick, now on Hulu. I tell everyone of my clients that these are both must reads/ watch to comprehend the heinous drug cartel The Sackler family of Purdue pharma. How Americas epidemic was systematically orchestrated by one families greed and in Lazarus some hopefull insights into how we can combat substance use and overdose deaths. Harm reduction and instant treatment access are paramount. Read the heart wrenching accounts of people who are on the front lines and those they are trying to save. If you do nothing else this summer/ devour these timely engaging books to understand Americas peril at the hands of evil greed, corruption, apathy, Chinese transnational and Mexican cartels.

It walks you through all the steps to build not only a will but makes you think of other things. Where do you want to go when you die? Do you want an event, music, food. What about your pets? What are the local rules. Do I need a lawyer. What kind of witnesses make it binding.... on and on. Just read the book, and run the program. You can do it several times. When you are ready, print and follow the instructions for witnesses and the local rules. You can even take this with you to a lawyer for another review. Do it, you family should be protected.\nAs a side note, there are some quirks in the program so make sure you try a sample will just to be comfortable with the protocol for saving or going back and correcting/changing items.",

It wants me to log in my account. Once I logged in, it did not allow me to go to tech support. I see no phone number. I think this product does not want to really support the customer, other than frequently asked questions, and then to get you to buy more products. So, I have reached a standstill.

    "This is an extremely powerful work on how to achieve mastery in one's life. Mastery can be thought of as the unique way each of us can fully actualize our potential for greatness and enjoy a fulfilling life.\n\nAchieving Mastery in life is a lot of work but it is the way to a flourishing life (a life of self-fulfillment). Spinoza's quote \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare\" came to mind several times as I read the book. The author provides ideas and strategies that can improve the process for those willing to expend the effort. I plan to re-read and work with the ideas and strategies covered in this book and apply them to my personal context. I also plan to purchase copies of the book for my wife and 2 teenage sons so they can benefit from this material as well.\n\nThe work begins by discussing how to discover one's purpose in life. This is unique to each individual and needs to be well thought through. The author gives 5 strategies for finding your life's task and illustrates these strategies with historical and contemporary figures. Two of the strategies he discusses that really gave me a lot to think about are:\n1. ) Occupy the perfect niche - the Darwinian strategy. In this strategy you need to find the career niche that best fits your interests and talents and then evolve that niche over time. I found the eaxample of V.S. Ramachandran very interesting\n2.) Let go of the past - the adaptation strategy. The following quote from this section that really resonated with me:\n\"You must adapt your Life's Task to these circumstances. You do not hold on to past ways of doing things, because it will ensure you will fall behind and suffer for it. You are flexible and looking to adapt.\"\n\nThe author then covers the Apprentice Phase which he breaks into 3 steps:\n1.) Deep Observation - the Passive Mode\n2.) Skills Acquisition - the Practice Mode\n3.) Experimentation - The Active Mode\n\nThere are detailed strategies for completing the ideal appenticeship. These are illustrated by examples. 2 of my favorites in this section were \"move toward resistance and pain\" as illustrated by the example of Bill Bradley and \"apprentice yourself in failure\" as illustrated by Henry Ford. All 8 strategies are worth thinking about in detail.\n\nThe next section covers learning through a Mentor and is one of the best parts of the book. The example of Michael Faraday is used as a great illustration. There are strategies discussed for finding the appropriate mentor(s), knowing when to break away from the mentor and what to do if you cannot find a mentor (the example here is Thomas Edison and there is an interesting tie-back to Faraday). Having a mentor is the most effective way to gain deep knowledge of a field in the least amount of time - it greatly accelerates that path to Mastery.\n\nThe next section deals with social intelligence and seeing people as they are. Benjamin Franklin is used as an example. There are 7 deadly realities covered in this section (envy, conformism, rigidity, self-obsessiveness, laziness, flightiness and passive aggression) as well as strategies for acquiring social intelligence.\n\nThe fifth section is on awakening the dimensional mind. This is where you see more and more aspects of reality and develop ways to become more creative (and not get stuck in the past). There are several strategies on creativity discussed in detail. I found the discussion on ways to alter one's perspective especially illuminating. These include avoiding:\n* Looking at the \"what\" instead of the \"how\"\n* Rushing to generalities and ignoring details\n* Confirming paradigms and ignoring anomalies - (key quote: \"...anomalies themselves contain the richest information. They often reveal to us the flaws in our paradigms and open up new ways of looking at the world\")\n* fixating on what is present, ignoring what is absent (Sherlock Holmes example)\n\nThe section continues with strategies and examples for this \"creative-active\" phase. My favorite was a section on Mechanical Intelligence with the Wright Brothers as an example.\n\nThe Final Section is on Mastery as the fusing of the Intuitive with the Rational. The strategies in this section are very powerful and I will be returning to them again and again. Here are the 7 strategies:\n1.) Connect to your environment\n2.) Play to your strengths (this is very important - see further thoughts on this below)\n3.) Transform yourself through practice\n4.) Internalize the details - the life force (Leonardo Da Vinci example)\n5.) Widen your vision\n6.) Submit to the other - the Inside Out perspective\n7.) Synthesize all forms of knowledge\n\nThis is a very powerful book filled with a lot of good ideas and strategies. There are ideas I plan to continue to \"chew\" on and think more deeply about while I work to integrate these ideas and strategies into my personal context.\n\nA lot of the book stresses the importance of self-discipline, persevering through difficult challenges, the importance of an adaptive and active mind, independent thinking and integrating all of one's knowledge. Here are a few recommendations I would make to augment the material covered in this book:\n1.) For Self-Displine and Willpower (and perseverance):\nWillpower by Tierney and Baumeister\nThe Power of Habit by Duhigg\nGrit (see TED Talk by Angela Duckworth and the GRIT assessment as well - Grit Assessment can be found at: available at [...])\n2.) For an adaptive/active mindset (and recovering from failure)\nMindset by Carol Dweck\nApapt by Tim Harford\n3.) For a great fictional example of many of the ideas covered in the book, I would recommend Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead (Roark as a positive example; Keating as a negative example of what the author calls \"the false self\")\n4.) Other Real world examples\nRichard Feynman (see his books \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\" and \"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\"\n5.) Finding your strengths\nStrengthsfinder 2.0 by Tom Rath\nVIA Survey of Character Strengths (available at [...])",
    "I wish I had read this book a little younger. It is inspiring and useful. There are author's comments about the importance of mastery, and stories to show what he is talking about.\nThe stories display that the process will take you to the results. That taking your learning and practice seriously and patiently is the way. We may be duped into thinking that fast is better, but learning and practicing over and over again will make you a true master.",
    "There are countless self-help books--some good, some trite. Then there are self-help books that revolutionize the genre.\n\nRobert Greene's Mastery is such a book. It's Greene's fifth book broadly tackling the art of strategy, and like all his books, it's entertaining, educational, densely packed with biographies of powerful and interesting people, and almost completely devoid of fluff.\n\nGreene's overarching thesis challenges the conventional notion of \"genius\" as a genetic gift bestowed upon a handful of individuals--Mozart and Einstein immediately come to mind. To Greene, such a conception of genius is illusory. All \"genius,\" Greene contends, is acquirable, and all masters, regardless of intrinsic ability, go through roughly the same process on their path towards mastery:\n\n1) Finding your Life's Task. Greene argues that there's an inner force that guides you towards what you're \"destined\" to accomplish. Once you discover your Life's Task, throw everything at it.\n\n2) Finding an ideal apprenticeship--the time when you hone the necessary skills and acquire the discipline vital to mastery.\n\n3) Finding the right mentor. This is the key to a fruitful apprenticeship, enabling you to absorb the master's knowledge and power. Greene cautions that you must know when it's time to sever ties with your mentor and craft your own path in order to prevent remaining in your mentor's shadow indefinitely. The goal, Greene advises, it to eventually surpass your mentor.\n\n4) Acquiring social intelligence. Social intelligence is an important theme in all of Greene's books. Quite simply, our personal and professional advancement will invariably stall if we don't learn to read people and deftly maneuver through the labyrinth of others' whims, passions, and ambitions.\n\n5) \"Awaken the Dimensional Mind: The Creative-Active.\" This stage involves expanding your knowledge to fields related to your craft, thereby challenging you to \"make new associations between different ideas.\" Greene believes this is a critical step to optimizing your creative output and achieving mastery.\n\n6) Fusing the intuitive with the rational. Greene argues that Einstein's discoveries can be as much attributed to his intuition as to his mathematical analysis grounded in pure reason. Practice and intimate knowledge of our field foster the integration of intuition with reason.\n\nFor each stage, Greene outlines concrete steps to take to achieve these goals, including approaching difficult problems from unconventional angles or altering your perspective, embracing the holistic approach--i.e. utilizing and synchronizing the full range of resources and options your environment has to offer.\n\nOne of the features that distinguishes Mastery from Greene's two other masterpieces, 33 Strategies of War and 48 Laws of Power, is its greater focus on the biographies of contemporary masters, most of whom are not well known to the general public. Greene delves into the lives of legendary masters like Mozart, Einstein, Goethe, Darwin, and da Vinci, but also of lesser known contemporary masters like software engineer and entrepreneur Paul Graham, animal scientist and inventor Temple Grandin, and linguistic archaeologist Daniel Everett, who cracked the previously thought to be indecipherable language of the reclusive Amazonian tribe, Piraha.\n\nLinking the human capacity for mastery to our biology and indeed, metaphysics, Greene writes in a veritably spiritual manner, making Mastery highly compelling and exceedingly motivational.\n\nThe title Mastery is fitting, since Greene is undoubtedly a master in the art of strategy. It is amusing to hear some of his detractors bemoan the \"amoral\" nature of his books. Amoral virtues--be it courage, prudence, or temperament--are indispensable to achieving moral ends. A strategically inept well-meaning person will likely fail to achieve any significant good, because he is ill-prepared to deal with endless obstacles that stand in his way. Whereas a person well versed in the art of strategy and equipped with the amoral virtues necessary to overcome such obstacles, has the potential to achieve noble ends.\n\nThe one area where I could quibble with Greene has to do with the age old debate over the role of nature vs. nurture. Since genetic makeup is a fixed variable outside of our control, it is perhaps pointless to dwell on its role in our development when writing a book about the concrete things we can actually do to better ourselves. Still, I wonder if Greene's unequivocal dismissal of the traditional interpretation of genius as inherent isn't to some extent mistaken. Regardless of how many thousands of hours Mozart spent studying his craft, is it really conceivable that any person of sound mind and body could replicate his success?\n\nI tend to think that there is something to be said about intrinsic genius; that there are masters who are born with an uncanny and natural ability to perceive things others do not and cannot, no matter how hard they try. Nevertheless, even if Greene errors in downplaying the role DNA plays in cultivating \"genius,\" it in no way diminishes his strategy for acquiring mastery. Whether all of us can become the Einstein in our field makes little difference. What matters is that we can reach our maximum potential--become men and women in full--by following Greene's blueprint.",
    "One of the best books I'v ever read - inspiring, well documented. LOVE IT! Greene understands the creative mind.",
    "Questionable on how he got all of these examples from the past.",
    "I am not sure such a thing exists, but the only thing I could say is that with the number of factoids within these books, a cheat sheet of them in brief would be a wonderful thing to have, perhaps a cliff notes version! Astounding insight for anyone looking to take a deeper pause and think about life!",
    "I came across this book purely by chance, and having loved his book about power, The 48 Laws of Power (Which I have also reviewed, so I won't go into it here) I bought the paperback. To my knowledge, there's an abridged (posh word for shortened) edition, but this is the whole enchilada at well over three hundred pages! It took a while to read, and the print is really small, so it's best you get the kindle version if your eyes aren't what they were! So, Monsieur Greene, on this outing, teaches some really valuable lessons on exploring the full potential of the human psyche using past and present masters of their crafts as examples, like Leonardo Da Vinci, Goethe, Faraday and Einstein. It's totally changed my perspective on life, as Greene suggests that we find our Life's Task, and not close off our minds to learning new skills and embracing change, whatever our age, instead of getting comfortable, because it's safe and reassuring. He mentions the importance of mentors, and that, in some cases, we have to mentor ourselves if no such mentors are available to us. And the important stages of learning an apprenticeship, from observation, to breaking free and striking out on your own. I found it really informative and useful, and I came away with two memorable pieces of information, one being that, when you feel you have nothing left to learn in a job or apprenticeship, it's time to leave, and a great quote by Einstein, who viewed the intuitive mind as a 'sacred gift' and the rational mind as 'a faithful servant.' He said that 'we have created a society where we honour the faithful servant and forget the gift'. There's something for everyone in this gem of a book if you stick with it, and what you can take to the bank is that Greene states that we all have it within ourselves to be masters and modern day geniuses, and that it's not merely the preserve of those who are 'naturals', He illustrates this point by referring to a pilot who was not naturally gifted, who put in the training and the hours to become one of the best, even when the odds were stacked against him, and the dedication of a top basketball player who, while not naturally gifted at the sport relentlessly displayed such dedication, passion and commitment, and the hard work paid off. Greene's message is clear, to truly get the most out of our lives, we have to push past our comfort zones and see what we are really capable of, with the right inspiration and guidance. Everyone should read this book, and I, for one, am very glad that I did. Well worth its five star rating!",
    "I don't know what to make of this book because it just feels so long-winded that his point just gets lost in a haze of woolly fluff, so I dont know where the great lessons are... unfortunately, I am a busy person and even though I am only less than a fifth of the way through, I feel as though I have learnt nothing at all so I am going to give up on this book... additionally, there just seems to be so much conjecture about evolution, religion, feelings, inner callings, vocations, power etc; I feel like I am being preached to by the leader of a cult... it's mindnumbing and much better books with solid evidence and practical steps are Peak by Anders Ericsson and Mindset by Carol Dweck... they are so much better than this.",
    "Similar to Greene's other writings in that it seems once you've read one you've pretty much read them all. They seem to follow the same rhetoric.\nI don't think I'd read another book by the author but I would recommend that everybody choose at least one book wisely. Depending on what you would to gain, Greene can definitely inspire you and his books do offer valuable pockets of knowledge for those interested in historical figures and insight into their characters.\nThe same concepts and themes are repeated throughout this book as touched upon in his highly regarded '48 Laws of Power'. These being the only two books by Greene I've read. His writing style can sometimes drag on and I was just pushing myself to finish after about half way through. Happy I read this one but not a book I'd read twice.",
    "Best book of self development I have ever read. I just wanted to buy the physical book as I have listened the audio book thats how good it is. It change my life somehow. I wish I could have read this book when I was 15.",
    "I believe that finding our life’s task and pursuing it with all of our energy is the highest path we can possibly undertake. My favourite nonfiction book, Mastery by Robert Greene, is the best introduction to this path of true fulfilment.\n\nI cannot reiterate often enough how important this book is for young people. It is empowering, inspiring, and full of great stories about masters from all walks of life. No other book or author comes close."

    "This book is divided into nine main chapters, with a total of only about 160 pages, not including the Endnotes and Index.\n\nThe book targets seven main categories of tax incentives, and there is a chapter dedicated to each one:\n1) Business, 2) Technology/R&D, 3) Real Estate, 4) Energy, 5) Agriculture, 6) Insurance, and 7) Retirement Savings.\n\nIn each section Wheelwright explains the basics of the tax incentives related to that category. He includes charts that show which countries have certain incentives/laws, and explains how these incentives ultimately benefit the government and the taxpayer. He stresses the difference between a “loophole”, (which is an unintended exploit); and an incentive which helps both the entrepreneur and the government (a win-win, hence the name of the book). A decent amount of time here is dedicated to explaining the reasoning behind these incentives, so the reader can feel more comfortable utilizing these incentives and see them as a benefit not just to themselves but to everyone else as well. There are a few examples in the chapters of what some of these deductions or credits might look like in hypothetical situations, so you can see the math and the potential savings.\n\nMy main complaint with this book is that there weren’t as many specific, useful tax tips as I had initially thought that there would be. There are many pages of charts showing whether certain policies exist in different countries, and of course for most people only one piece of information on those charts will be relevant (the country you are in). The book is only about 160 pages, and Wheelwright also spends many pages explaining why these general tax incentives exist, and how they benefit the government and ultimately even all the citizens/taxpayers. This is interesting information if you were not already aware, but it seems to be included mostly to make the reader FEEL better about taking advantage of tax incentives; instead of providing lots of specific details about the actual obscure or underused tax incentive laws that might save you money. Still, there is some great information here, and this book seems like a good starting point if you want to begin to better understand the “tax game”, and what you can start to do to use your financial resources more efficiently.",
    "I've always thought the phrase \"The rich should pay their fair share of taxes\" was classist, divisive, and just plain wrong. This book does a good job explaining why the phrase is wrong. The rich are paying their fair share according to what our government values as important. Our government creates all these tax deductions and credits to incent people to invest in businesses, agriculture, energy, housing, technology, and retirement plans. All the former give people jobs, housing, food, transportation, and income for retirement. The book outlines example after example of how to use these incentives with debt to dramatically and legally reduce your tax burden. It also shows how much the government benefits from these deductions and credits. The rich aren't doing anything wrong. They are just doing what the government is incenting them to do which are typically things we all value as important. More importantly, these strategies are not just for the rich, but available to everyone. The examples are straightforward and easy to understand. I highly recommend people add this to their financial library.",
    "I truly loved Tom’s first book - Tax Free Wealth. I have given dozens of copies away just in the last year.\n\nHowever when I got to read an advanced copy of this book - I was truly blown away. Tom’s knowledge has done more to change my financial trajectory than any other author.\n\nHe takes a boring subject - Taxes and Investing and makes them interesting, easy to understand, and actionable.\n\nPaying a low percentage in taxes isn’t a bad thing (unless it’s fraud). Paying lower taxes means that you have decided to follow the government’s direction on how to use your excess capital - to create jobs, fund your retirement, buy real estate, protect your family, and do good.\n\nGive this book a chance and you won’t regret it. In fact you will prob read all of Tom’s books, listen to his podcasts, and hire his companies just like I did.",
    "Tom Wheelwright's latest book is a fantastic compliment to his last book Tax Free Wealth. It's an easy read with some surprising conclusions on how the government actually benefits from taxpayers who legally pay no tax via incentives in the tax law. I'd recommend the book over the audio, as the tables illustrate very well the financial benefit to the government and taxpayers of incentives like carry-forward losses (AMZN and Bezos), research and development, real estate (Trump), energy and other government darlings. Great book and I can't recommend it enough!",
    "You need to buy this plus his previous book so you can take \"Uncle Sam as your partner\" & get all the tax breaks you are entitled to. Get a great CPA who asks lots of questions & is well informed about your specific business plus study yourself so you know what questions to ask!",
    "Thank you Tom for sharing your tax savings strategies with the common man what only the rich knew till today",
    "Really appreciated this book. My husband and I already use some of these strategies, but there were several we weren’t aware of! Looking forward to working towards taking advantage of these tax incentives 👏👏",
    "This book is a quick and easy read packed with valuable information about how to partner with the government to make the world a better place all while making yourself wealthy in the process!"

    "Very neat! It’s Shakespeare’s Macbeth, and I used it for school and annotated it. It’s pocket sized, so easy to carry around.",
    "A perfect guide for this amazing play.",
    "Just what was needed for school",
    "Would have give it 5 stars but because the book came with something sticky at the bottom of the pages (wasn't that bad, could take it out with a sticker remover)",
    "To better understand the recent production of Macbeth.",
    "it’s macbeth! how much better can you get?",
    "I was recently offered a role in a local community theater production of William Shakespeare’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth.” The play’s director encouraged all actors to gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare’s words, to better perform each part. He suggested a book entitled “SparkNotes No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth” as a guide.\n\nI purchased a paperback copy of “No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth,” and I am very pleased with it. This wonderful little book is set up with Shakespeare’s original words on each left-hand page; on each right-hand page is a modern English paraphrase of the original script. While I was memorizing my lines from the left-hand pages, I quickly discovered I could learn my character’s deeper motivations for what he was saying by referring to the modern English paraphrase. As a result, I learned my lines more quickly, and am more effectively portraying my character during rehearsals.\n\n“No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth” also includes a full list of main characters with their descriptions, as well as occasional footnotes that help clarify the meaning of some words, phrases, and situations.\n\nI’ve always loved reading the works of William Shakespeare for simple enjoyment, and I found that “No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth” not only helped me greatly in preparing for our upcoming performances of our local production of “Macbeth;” it also gave me tremendous enjoyment in reading the play itself. I plan on buying many more volumes in the “No Fear Shakespeare” series. Highly recommended.",
    "You could technically just look the meaning up for free online, but nothing beats the ease of just having the book there. And makes it easier for actors playing the character so you actually KNOW what they're saying.",
    "Was told about these “No Fear Shakespeare” books by an English teacher. I bought two, to sit with my Y9 twin boys recently to read in conjunction with watching The Globe Theatre production of Macbeth streaming on YouTube. My boys are actually enjoying Shakespeare! Broken down into a couple of scenes per day (boys’ concentration is short)! We read the new English translation then watch those scenes. Just wow. Really pleased with our progress so far ahead of them studying Macbeth in Y10.",
    "When I searched through the many different publications of the Macbeth play, I particularly wanted one which not only showed the original text but also gave an easy-to-understanding modern-day English translation or explanation. I noted there were over 2,500 reviews. Some reviewers mentioning the book contained Modern English text side-by-side with Old English text; another review stated the book included simplified modern day translation. But when I received the product, I saw nothing of the sort - just a complete text of the play with some additional comments reference character movements or scene depictions. Had the reviews been listed under the wrong product, I thought ? Where were these side-by-side translations ? In hindsight, a quick check of the contents using the \"Look Inside\" icon would have shown me what I was to expect to receive. Needless to say, I have returned the book and ordered another product.",
    "This is a fantastic book! My son has Dyslexia and Dysgraphia, so can struggle with difficult texts and books, like Macbeth. This means as he is following the story, it gives a clear interpretation directly beside. It's so perfect and I honestly believe these should be given out to help children ar school. It's definitely going to make my sons level of understanding a whole lot easier and higher level.",
    "Bought as a gift for the 15 year old son of a friend who was struggling with Shakespeare studies during online lockdown learning. These guides are so helpful with their layout of original text, modern translation and helpful side notes. He has found his invaluable, and was in a much better position returning to school and preparing for mock GCSEs.",
    "Great book, breaks the text down into layman' terms so ideal for getting a grasp of Shakespeare without having to contend with the language as the original is printed alongside the simplified version on the same page. Great for GCSE students."

    "This has been a difficult book for me to rate. On one hand, I really liked it. On the other hand, I couldn't stop thinking that it fell quite short on some aspects of product management. I will explain both of those reasons in more detail below, but let me first tell a bit about my background as I think it is relevant for this review.\n\nI have been in the industry for more than 20 years. Currently, I am the co-founder and Chief Product Officer of a startup that creates networking solutions for the Internet of Things. Previously, I worked for a very large networking vendor in both technical and business roles for more than 15 years. My last role there was a Sr. Product Manager in Office of the CTO. Previously, I held roles as a Product Line Manager (PLM) managing P&Ls north of $200 million. I was also a Program Manager managing multi-year multi-million dollar projects that won innovation awards etc. Throughout my career I coded things, launched products and tools that have been very successful and that are still in use. I also launched products that didn't take of as I had expected them to. I am an engineer by education, I have a EE degree and an MBA and several advanced certifications in business and technical domains. Although I don't have a background in CS, I code for personal projects and I also code for our startup. I have open source repositories on GitHub that have a total of 100 stars in total. I certainly won't claim I know much but I think I have had my fair share of experience dealing with technology, specifically in a B2B/Enterprise model.\n\nI try to keep myself refreshed by learning new things, reading books, working on side projects etc. That is the reason I read this book. I liked it and I also thought it missed some aspects while focusing only on a subset of a larger picture. That is what this review is about.\n\nFirst the good stuff. Product Management is a bit of a mystery for outsiders. It is partly science and partly art. There is no specific education for Product Management, which makes it a bit hard to grasp. To make matters worse, it may mean very different things in different companies. Sometimes it is perceived to be more of a marketing role, sometimes it is under engineering and so forth. On this topic, I think the authors have done a pretty good job in creating a fundamental structure for understanding Product Management and making it approachable for those who are aspiring to be Product Managers (mine was a bit of luck, I built a service as an engineer which became so successful that they asked me to lead a team to build it for external customers and launch it as a product manager). I liked that the authors gave specific examples on what product management means in different companies, I also liked that they outline paths for engineers and designers to become product managers, which makes a lot of sense.\n\nAuthors provide some very good behavioral questions and reasoning behind those questions. I particularly enjoyed seeing that they busted some myths (as they explain, Product Managers are not CEOs of their products, however cool it may sound!). Many of those behavioral questions are also applicable to other roles that require soft skills (Project Management, Program Management, Customer Service etc.) as well and can easily be part of a study plan for interviews for those roles. I must admit, some of the estimation questions challenged me (I haven't done those in so generic ways for probably over a decade) and at times I felt intimidated, which is an indication of good balance.\n\nThat made me think, how many times I have asked those generic questions myself while interviewing other PMs and the answer is, it wasn't much (I will explain why below). That also made me think what else was amiss.\n\nThat brings us to stuff that I think can be improved. It feels that the authors' experience has been primarily in a B2C context and the book shows it. Content heavily skews towards consumer oriented Product Management. Majority, if not all examples and questions are around consumer products. Companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc.) in question are well known but they share a lot of common traits and pretty much all are consumer focused (and on a side note, it may be time to take out examples from Yahoo and Twitter). There are a few questions that venture slightly outside of B2C but it is an exception. Microsoft is arguably the only company that sits somewhere between B2C and B2B in this list, but the way it is covered is still through the lens of consumers. There is nothing wrong with this approach but it misses a perspective of Product Management for B2B, Enterprise Software and Hardware companies which have their own challenges.\n\nThree things that stood out the most for me was a lack of focus on go-to-market strategies, content creation and to a lesser degree, domain expertise. Go-to-market strategy and execution consumes a significant portion of a Product Manager's time and is thus reflected in interviews. Similarly, in most B2B companies, Product Managers are expected to create collateral in the form of presentations (not the fluffy stuff but the ones that have factual information), competitive analysis for sales teams, whitepapers, use-cases etc. A lot of time is also spent on helping sales teams to win deals by helping them with RFPs etc. These activities can intersect with those from marketing (and sometimes sales) but it is an important activity for Product Managers. So, these also are also reflected in interviews, depending on the experience and background of the candidate.\n\nGo-to-market is covered in some indirect ways but I didn't find it nearly complete enough. In real life, if I ever created and presented a business case without a fairly detailed go-to-market strategy to an executive team or even a wider PM team, that could have been the end of my career. And when I say go-to-market, I mean an in-depth plan with channel strategies, partnerships etc. Once again, we are talking B2B here. This is reflected in interviews and we expect people to come with at least some knowledge of and experience in go-to-market strategies. I didn't think the coverage of this in the book was enough.\n\nSecond to go-to-market, there was also no mention of collateral creation. In our interviews, we expect people to demonstrate previous experience on content creation, let it be in the form of blog posts, technical white papers for engineers, product documentation etc. If you are applying for a product manager role in a B2B context, I'd recommend you to have some collateral that you can showcase. It can come in different forms depending on your experience and job history but this will be important.\n\nThe last part is the lack of focus on domain expertise. This will depend on the industry, company and your previous experience but domain expertise is important for product management especially in B2B. So, while you may get generic estimation questions if you apply for junior roles, in more senior roles, you will be asked more specific replacement questions that require fairly in-depth domain knowledge. This brings out the other implicit assumption that I observed in the book. It is aimed at people who are planning to move to product management starting in more junior roles. There is a certain emphasis on fresh college graduates. So, examples and context make a lot of sense for that target group. But be aware that expectations can vary significantly beyond that target group especially for different industries and companies.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a valuable book and I applaud the authors for writing it. I recommend it to anyone who is planning to venture into Product Management, also to seasoned Product Managers for some fun and refreshment (just put it into context and set your expectations accordingly). I enjoyed reading it and admittedly it helped me to refresh some topics that I haven't practiced for a while. I get a similar feeling when I open my books from college or MBA days and it feels refreshing at some level. But also understand that this is geared towards people who are in earlier stages of their careers and the content is skewed towards B2C companies and products. I think a different title would be much more accurate and to the point: \"Product Management 101 - Interviewing in the age of social media and new tech\"",
    "I was a PM many moons ago. This book helped me prep for several conversations as I interviewed for a Product Operations role. I was well prepared, and did get a cool new job as a result",
    "Really good book that covers every single aspect you need to know about interviewing for the PM roles as well as its career outlook",
    "The content of the book is helpful by explaining what kind of people some of the companies are looking for and the company’s culture. The book arrived new but the corner was ripped.",
    "Love it great read with prep info",
    "Best book for preparing for PM interviews",
    "Everyone told me it’s the best book for people who want to be a pm, ummmm…. Hope I can read it and enjoy it",
    "The content of the book is mostly great except for those in the case study/problem solving section. I found them very American-centric in that the only way to solve those problems was to make assumptions that you would only be able to make if you have been raised in the US. There are no strategies suggested for how to cope when presented with a problem for which you have no point of reference with which to make assumptions. Here are a couple of examples -\n\nThere was a sample problem involving dog food sales in the US. If you've neither owned a pet in the US nor watched TV ads, you have no way of knowing that that there are 2 types of dog food (wet and dry), that they come in 20 lb bags typically, and that a fair assumption is 1 cup of dog food is consumed by a large dog per meal. All of these are key to solving the problem.\n\nThere was another example illustrating how many high schools there are in the US. Unless you went to school in this country, it's not possible to make a key assumption that was used to solve the problem - the total number of students in an average high school.\n\nDitto for the school bus problem where you're asked to estimate the weight. It was only upon reading the book I knew there are 15 rows of seats in a US school bus, and that's a key assumption in coming up with anything close to the answer.\n\nI suppose one could ask the interviewer these questions, but is that the right strategy? It would have been helpful if the book had addressed this.\n\nThat said, the main reason I am taking off a star is for the formatting/editing on Kindle. I came across at least 6 pages where the text didn't transition from one page to the next (content on new page was irrelevant, with no continuity from the last sentence in the previous page) and the tables were empty or populated with question marks. Either it was not edited at all and was subjected to automatic conversions or the editor had a very poor eye for details. Either way, it detracts from the value of the content, and makes for a disruptive reading experience.",
    "I'm twisted about this book.\nIt generally gives a good indication of the interview process for US based companies, although it mainly focuses on Google, with a few indications on Amazon and very small bits for Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook.\nThe general principles on the product manager role are very valid, they make you think not only how to prepare yourself for an interview but also what you should aim for in a PM role beyond the interview phase. Also, for cases like Google or Amazon if you don't know the interview process well and the type of questions you'd be asked you won't get far, and the book is surely useful for that. However when it comes to estimation questions or product design questions the answers provided are imho far too unrealistically precise and structured than answers from a candidate during an interview. I get they're willing to open your mind into a way of tackling similar questions but I personally found them beyond reasonable and therefore patronising, unless you have access to Google search when interviewing at Google (which you don't).\nOverall the book translates perfectly the culture at US tech giants, all they seem to care about is their own culture and whether you can adapt your past experiences and skills to their culture. No value whatsoever to your own professional experience or achievements per se which has personally put me off applying to PM roles for such firms.\nAll in all I'd recommend the book, but don't make it your personal bible. And be warned that everything there refers to a world where only US exists, examples, metrics, mindset, everything screams stars and stripes.",
    "I currently work as a Product Manager and I used this book to ensure that I have all the basics and framework nailed to confirm that I am doing my role to the best of my ability.\n\nI'm not actively looking for a job, but as I progressed internally in the company I work at, I've never had a proper Product Manager interview, so I was curious to see what one is like to be able to determine whether or not I would likely be successful or not. After all, considering I progressed internally, am I even doing the correct day to day stuff that a PM should be?\n\nSo I used this book to see the kinds of questions that recruiters and companies ask during the Product Management Interview process.\n\nThis book was a great insight and made me realise the following:\n\n- Product Management interviews aren't usually just a sit down face to face. You'll end up doing something like a whiteboard challenge to show you understand the product development lifecycle all the way from ideation to delivery.\n\n- If you want to work at most of the big tech companies, you'll need to have some coding experience as you'll be expected to show understanding in the interview. I am by no means an engineer, more a strategy/community based PM, so this book has opened my eyes to what I should and shouldn't be aiming for as I progress through my Product Management career.\n\nOverall, this book is a must have whether you are looking for a new PM role or not.\n\nAsh",
    "Read it, realised how insufficient my CV was and used its tips and guide to re write it. Got an interview of the back of that, and then got a product manager job first try. Its fantastic, and a really good insight into product management as a career path, whats required to actually be able to do it, and whats required to show you are good it. Have lent the book to other people since, as it provides fantastic preperation for job hunting in general .",
    "This is a great book and definitely helped me get my PM job. Warning: the Kindle edition has some formatting errors, especially with the code.",
    "This is great - not just about the interview step but how to work your cv/resume, as well as what to be focusing on in your current role whether you're a product manager looking for a new opportunity or someone wanting to move into their first product management role. I got my first job in product management recently and feel that this really helped me along the way!"

    "I started with the hardbound version of this book from my local library and finished with the softcover cover version from Amazon.\n\nBurton Malkiel gives a very broad overview of how our securities markets are structured, how they operates, and how we interact with them. This includes a history lesson in bubbles, booms, busts, depressions, recessions, and rallies from the Tulip craze to today's time. Malkiel covers everything from stocks to bonds to mutual funds and more. There's chapters on charting, modern portfolio theory, and CAPM. Although this book is meant to be an overview, there is a lot ... and, I mean ~a lot~ ... of information here. The text reads like a professor at a university trying to give an interesting lecture or presentation. Some of the chapters, like the history of market swings, I found interesting to read because I like history in general - the whole how and why of events and their influence on how we got to day.I also enjoyed the chapters on investing behavior and psychology. Other chapters, like on charting, beta, and government backed bonds did not captivate me much. The information was sometimes too technical in nature and sounded like a bunch of hooey to me or just didn't apply to my personal investing strategy.\n\nThe whole text can be boiled down to a few key concepts.\n\nFirst, the market is irrational and unpredictable. Don't try too hard to outsmart it or time it just right. The blips and dips in security prices, random world events like terrorist attacks or government scandals, and unjustified exuberance or pessimism are too much for anyone or anything to take on. You won't win. You may get lucky and think you won but you could have just as easily lost. Hence, the random walk.\n\nTwo, despite all that dreck in #1 above, investing in the stock market still beats out any other investment in the long run. Buy, *hold*, **add**, and repeat. Don't fall prey to jittery emotions or the whims and wiles of \"professional\" investors with messages of doom and gloom. Like Warren Buffett said, the best holding time is forever.\n\nThree, picking a winning stock is not easy. Suppose you are a young investor with a small sum of money like $5k. How will you invest it? Do you feel confident in picking a stock or two? Will your picks beat the market average? Maybe, if you pick right under the right conditions. However, the best way to invest in the market would be through an index fund that reflects the very market you want to invest in. The index fund, either as an ETF or Mutual Fund, will contain a little of everything that reflects the index it is benchmarked against. The SPY will follow the S&P, DIA will follow the Dow Jones, QQQ will track the Nasdaq 100. So, why risk picking one or two stocks when you can kind of have them all?\n\nFour, diversify your diversification. The index funds diversify your money among many securities. You can go further and diversify by investing in international funds. The idea is some international funds can outperform US funds. They can also \"zig\" when the US funds \"zag\".\n\nFive, and lastly, skip the services of a professional advisor. He's no genie or wizard. You can do just as well as he can if not better.\n\nI agree with 1, 2, and 5 above but I disagree somewhat with 3 and 4.\n\nRegarding 3, you ought to be able to open up any index fund and see exactly what it is holding and how much. For example, if you want to know what SOXX is holding then go to the iShares website and look at it. It's all there. Rather than buying SOXX I can skip the middleman and his approximately 0.5% fee and just buy those securities ... or, at least the top 10. Many brokerage firms, like Fidelity, offer fractional trading down to 0.001 shares as long as the resulting purchase price is at least $0.01. Now, that means you ought to put in some work and learn how to follow a stock. At least you have a starting point.\n\nGoing further, assume you rolled over a pension or 401(k) into a traditional and/or a Roth IRA. You may find yourself with a large sum of money, like $100k or more. With money like that you can build up a serious version of your own equivalent of an index fund with anywhere from 20 to 80 securities.\n\nNow, I will counter myself and repeat what I said above. This will involve quite a bit of work over a long period of time. You have companies to keep track of and all that. It can become like a second job, In that case, maybe a simple all-in-one index fund is all you need.\n\nRegarding 4, I think you ought to use some of the advanced charting tools or total returns calculators available from your broker or somewhere else online to compare how US securities performed compared to international securities. Compare some of the US best like QQQ, SPY, SOXX, and IGV to country specific funds that focus on New Zealand, China, and Russia. If you see these international funds outperformed their US counterparts then you have a starting point for a case for international diversification. Personally, I didn't see it. I saw the US centric ETFs and securities far outperform a majority of international funds. Diversification here wouldn't make sense. Why would I split money between two markets, one that can grow >8% per year over 10 years and one that can grow ~4% per year over 10 years? I'd rather pour everything that I can into the highest performing instrument available. If something better comes around after a couple of years then I divest one and buy the other. Or, even better, buy more of the depressed security knowing that it will rebound.\n\nSo, while I don't agree with everything Malkiel says it did provoke a lot of thought in my mind and for that I give it 5 stars.",
    "I have read several books on investing and found this to be the best. It provides relevant details and logical reasoning in each chapter for the conclusion. Although the final recommendation for stock investing is similar to that of John Bogle, i.e., invest in the market index!",
    "My Econ professor mentioned this book So I gave it a read. It’s very informative and gives a lot of valuable information. I made notes and will read again I’m sure",
    "Extremely sensible investment advice for the vast majority of us.",
    "I teach economics at the college level and have been investing for 10+ years. I cannot recommend this book enough. I have a copy and purchased it as a gift for my (much) younger siblings. It is THE book for beginning investors. Read this book and open a ROTH IRA - that is the two most beneficial bits of advice for any young person.",
    "As a young adult looking to start investing, I discovered A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel, which kickstarted my journey into my future career in the financial industry. In four sections broken into 15 chapters, Malkiel introduces new investors to the complexity of the stock market by offering a gentle start to a potentially rough journey by advocating for index fund investing. I enjoyed how Malkiel introduces strategies (like technical and fundamental analysis) that conflict with his own while still defending why he offers the best opportunity for the average investor. However, this book is not written for the financial know-it-all, so some examples slow down the pace to cater to a broader, less knowledgeable audience which is essentially the book’s purpose. Nevertheless, this book is deserving of a 5-star rating because of the way it introduces topics that can intimidate the average reader but eventually builds credibility to support the author’s argument. Overall, this book serves as a small first step for new investors to begin a long walk in the financial industry.",
    "The first page of the 'forward' is worth the price of the book. Malkiel's common sense advice has won top ranking in university competition with real time investments.",
    "An excellent introductory book for someone interested in starting a long term investing program in the stock market using index mutual funds.",
    "I listened to this book on audible first and really enjoyed it to start with. I have read lots of books on the stock market/investing over the years and had high hopes for this after looking at the good reviews. It starts well but then gets a bit boring as it keeps going on about the same thing which is to put your money in index funds. Just keeps going over and over why you should do this. Repetitive.",
    "A wonderful book, full of knowledge, graphics and data that make it so easy to understand. A lot of inspiration and motivation for my retirement plan.",
    "Enjoying this, half way way through it. Great if you're new to investing. It's a US book and I'm in in UK but that doesn't make a huge difference. The book is long. I guess you could just dive in to the sections you find relevant.",
    "This book is must read, eye opener in some instances",
    "The fundamental text for new investors. Clearly written with colorful examples makes this book easily accessible for novice investors and the more seasoned alike."

    "I spent a tremendous amount of time trying to understand the workflow and philosophy behind Smart Notes and the Zettelkasten method in hopes that they'd prepare me to write.\n\nBut, no matter how many notes I took or how I organized them in sequences they just left me feeling that I wasn't ready and that I needed more knowledge to finish out the knowledge structure that began to form. In hindsight, the Smart Notes method doesn't match how I work. I'm a software engineer by trade and my whole career has been project-focused. Not having an end in sight was very unsettling to me. I'd fight that feeling for as long as I could, but the more I gardened the worse that feeling became. Eventually, I'd ditch the whole thing and start over again. Each iteration was slightly more successful but ultimately lead to the same outcome.\n\nI've been using the P.A.R.A method for about 2 weeks and that anxiety I used to have is already gone\n\nBy focusing on my projects and collecting notes as I go I can see them becoming useful in the future, but only after they've helped me finish the high-priority work at hand. Moving notes from projects downward into a knowledge base within resources freed me from working the other way \"bottom-up\" which kept me hamstrung for so long.",
    "I think I'm good at capturing. But we are just hoarders if not being well-organized with the information we have accumulated over the years and will continue to encounter.\nFirst, this book taught me how to be a better organizer by being more goal-oriented and more intentional with my note-taking apps I already use, OneNote and Apple Notes. I started to explore Notion as well. I'm learning to use each app for specific items that aim to help me achieve my goals, manage my projects and even my daily life in a more systemic and productive way. I also started to use Instapaper for later reading. All these steps happened after reading Building a Second Brain. This book is a must-read for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). A Second Brain is a must-have for knowledge workers in this information age.\nSecondly, this book reinforces my belief that it is never late to dream big. The essence of this book is CODE and PARA. CODE is a robust system to get you to take actions on capturing, organizing, distilling and expressing. PARA is a revolutionary system on on how you approach information and research to accomplish your goals. I believe both CODE and PARA are lifelong endeavors that will transform you and your world over time.\nPARA is a game changer. You have a goal of writing and publishing a book? PARA is right for you. You have a goal of receiving a PhD in a specific field? PARA is right for you. You have a goal of learning how to play a musical instrument? PARA is right for you. You have a goal of beautifying your home? PARA is right for you. You have a goal of becoming an excellent chef? PARA is right for you...The list can go on and on. This is because PARA helps you break your goals into actionable steps, one project after another, to help you reach your goals, big or small.\nIf you want to improve your productivity and be more creative, this book is for you. If you don't think you are the creative type, you will know you are wrong after reading this book. Everyone has talent waiting to be discovered. Everyone has a voice that deserves the best self-expression. This book believes in you, in jumpstarting you to take actions.\nFinally, Tiago Forte is an embodiment of what he teaches. He uses his methodology to reach his goals. This book is an example of what one can achieve in following his system he eloquently shared with us. I strongly recommend you get the book today.",
    "This book will make me a BETTER writer!\n\nKey actions to change my writing process:\n-Distill my writing. Write for busy, impatient readers.\n-Make my writing actionable.\n(My predisposition to be comprehensive hinders my ability to build an audience of loyal readers. If my writing is too long, people won’t even start to read what I wrote or won’t finish what I wrote. Focus on value per seconds of reading time.)\n\nKey enabling habits:\n-Practice Progressive Summarization on my own writing: Bold, highlight, and create executive summaries of my own writing. Practice the “Generation Effect” (page 76) versus just copying and pasting my information to repurpose my blog article content on social media. Turn my executive summaries into quotes that I share on Instagram.\n- Let go of FOMO. I don’t need to capture all information. I don’t need to include all insightful information into my writing. Let go of my fear of missing out on the information I didn’t capture and the information I didn’t include into my writing outputs.\n- Focus on writing smaller pieces of writing. The shorter my individual writing outputs are, the more I’ll create and the closer I’ll be to building a writing flywheel. The more writing I produce, the more opportunities I’ll have for feedback from my readers. View my writing as Intermediate Packets.\n\nNote: Before I read this book, I learned how to implement a Second Brain Notion system from Tiago Forte’s YouTube videos. Before I read this book, I was already a fan of Tiago’s work. But this book exceeded my expectations. If you read the book, you’ll reach different conclusions and takeaways from above.",
    "This is not just a system, but a community of people devoted to productivity in the age of information overwhelm. They show you how to process and store useful content by making it relevant and accessible throughout your life. It’s much more and while I’ve just begun this journey, it’s already paid dividends by giving me the space to think and the confidence in the value of my thinking now and for the future me when I get there.",
    "I’m a very forgetful person, and left to my own devices, I will drop the ball on everything. Having a system in place around me has made me much better at all aspects of my life. As long as I’m putting things into my system and using it as designed, I’m downright reliable now. (I use GTD along with my 2nd Brain.) while you’ve been able to get a lot of the 2nd Brain content online, having 1 book that lays it all out, has been very helpful to reassess my 2nd Brain and make improvements.",
    "I had low expectations from this book and still feel disappointed.\n\nThe content of the book is: 1. make notes 2. organize files in projects, areas, resources and archives (para) 3. start generating output based on your notes. That is not worth more than a blog post post Getting Things Done. The rest of the book is filler material in the form of anecdotes and it is hard to find any actionable content because of all the fluff.\n\nThe bonus chapter advertised in the TOC is only provided as a PDF, you are forced to provide your E-Mail address, before getting an E-Mail with the link.",
    "I pre-ordered this book with very high expectations, fortunately Tiago meets them. I find his system to be helpful for people like me who are semi-structured. We want structure and are willing to put in the effort to build and organize digital lives in a structured way but just don't know how to turn our wants for structure into an actionable method with structure.\n\nOnly suggestion I'd make is to get to the point in the book much quicker. The book really starts in chapter 4 or 5. Before chapter 4's ending and chapter 5's beginning I felt like there was plenty of style but the substance was missing. Once chapter 4 started to close out and 5 started, then it really hit me that the book has real substance and insight.",
    "Having seen many blogs and youtubers talking about personal informatuon management i decided to research into the feasibility of such systems helping me with my poor memory and recall issues.\n\nI recently read Dr. Rangan Chatterjee's book Happy Mind, Happy Life and i have found the techniques the Tiago describes in his book that there is a lot of synergy in the two core concepts.\n\nI will be definitely taking on board their guiding principles moving forward.",
    "The initial explainers and diagrams were good, but the next two thirds dragged on.\n\nThere's no real guidance for merging personal and multiple client brains together.\n\nFor example I'm considering iCloud files and Apple notes for personal, Google drive for client A and Microsoft drive for client B. The clients don't want their IP in my personal space, nor anywhere outside of their domain.\n\nI also struggle with encouraging PARA folders in multiple tools (email, files, notes, etc) rather than trying to centralise everything in one holistic tool, for example it leads to inconsistencies or worse confusion if you're not quite sure which tool its in.\n\nSearch tools help of course, but I got the impression that the author has the luxury of working for himself and therefore the luxury of not having to sandbox files between different domains.\n\nThat being said, I'm excited to try and adopt many suggestions, which to be honest their blog covers far more succinctly than the book.",
    "Concise and genuinely helpful advice that almost anyone can find something that'll help them. It has personally helped me with just finding a system system that works for my own digital life. PARA is an excellent system of organisation that I can't believe I ever lived without."

    "First of all, like others before me, I consider having to pay for this printed manifesto as an action Karl Marx would strongly disagree with. Now to the review.\n\nNo doubt a masterfully written very eloquent and deliberate presentation of Karl Marx’s version of communism. The communist manifesto starts out with a descriptionOf history and the development of the bourgeoisie As a revolution against feudalism. Then it moves into showing that the natural progression of this revolution is the revolution of the proletariat.\n\nThe language here is quite beautifully written and laid out in a logical and easy to understand way. No doubt this manifesto was written for the proletariat. However, it was written while speaking to the bourgeoisie.\n\nWhat I find quite crafty and ingenious of the manifesto is how it interpret historical events and predict future events from the viewpoint of Carl Marx‘s version of what the proletariat future should be and what has happened to the proletariat in the past. He took known facts eloquently presented them, and skewed towards is on ideology and the plight of the proletariat of that time. Essentially make it quite difficult for the average man (the proletariat) to resist such Artful and master for writing.\n\nIt is also clear that Carl Marx believe that all other “socialism” were incorrect and Are fallacious in their ideology and practices. Only Karl Marx (the German) Socialism is a true Socialism.\n\nHidden in this argument is the complete omission of the fact that the “proletariat“ would have not gotten to the place they are and the level of development they are without the activities that has gone before them. No doubt things could’ve been better but what Karl Marx advocated to create that change, with hindsight we can see was utterly destructive.\n\nThis wonderfully written and Beautifully crafted manifesto started out with the plight Of the “Proletariat” taking on the emotional appeal to the average man, letting him see that not only is his condition “dire” - leaving out the fact that his condition is significantly improved over hundreds of years ago - and that it is the bourgeoisie who is responsible. This opens up the way to propose violent reallocation of capital and land, and to erect the purest of totalitarian society.\n\nI am writing this review with the hindsight of history. Knowing that this entire framework was a disaster. And that it had not worked out in the past and it will not work in the present. No matter how it’s restructured and reformulated for “the times”. That being said however, had I lived Indy 19th century early 20th century with little knowledge of sound socioeconomic principles it is clear that I may not of been able to resist such artfully crafted and eloquently presented sociological an economical Framework. One that was so beautifully written and would’ve spoke directly to my soul, with the grandest of denouement. ““What do you have to lose but your chains. Workers of the world unite” (paraphrased).\n\nCaveat: three-star primarily because of how well the manifesto was written. Not for its ideologies. Otherwise, I would’ve gotten no stars.",
    "No.... No he wasn't. Marx was consumed by his own ambition and obsession.\nThis book is great because their diagnosis of capitalism's faults is accurate.\nThe prescription, however, is wrong. Some might even say, DEADLY.\nMarx's idea of communism is an almost naive world view that disregards the inevitability of human nature.",
    "Marx is not the easiest read, but well worth it if you have the time to dig in. Marxist dialectics is particularly interesting",
    "Marx' communist manifesto is an interesting read and gives great insight into the ideology of communism. However, I found Marx' emphasis on class struggle as the end all be all to be very shortsighted and even a bit naive. Overall, a good read though.",
    "not much content.",
    "Doesnt contain the principals of communism.",

    "Easy to read & understand",
    "I first bought the Cannabis Handbook by Rosenthal, which was just ok.\nThis is certainly a MUCH better resource!!! The amount of information packed into this book is perfect for the first time grower. LST, Super Cropping, Tooping, ScROG??? THERE ARE ACTUAL GUIDES WITH PICTURES IN THIS BOOK!\nFlowering? Trimming? YEP! Color photos of all of the steps.\nNo advertisements in this one.",
    "I really did my research on this and took a long time to decide which book to buy. It was a crapshoot between each book being considered, but I chose this one because it appeared more professional. After reading this entire book and looking through to stages relevant as my cannabis grows, I am left wanting, so I end up looking up things online after all.\n\nThe content of the book at first seems good at a glance, but as you start reading, the author states that you are not going to know or understand anything he is talking about, unless you read the ENTIRE book. This was a red flag to me but I did as he instructed. After finishing the book.....I am quite displeased. More so that I took too long to read it and cant return it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the book has useful information, some of which is more advanced than I care to know at this point (breeding, etc.), but the information that is supposed to be most useful is sporadically placed about and not able to remember because he jumps around a lot and definitely misses things that are important to know. Which brings me to my next point. Not enough pictures to describe the most important things being described, but sure are plenty of random pictures of some good looking bud.....with no relevant context of the surrounding text. The diagrams of the plants that do exist are not very good and lack key part identifications being described in the text. Throughout the read I often said, \" I wish there was a diagram that showed this, because I don't know what he is talking about\".\n\nThe troubleshooting section?.......pfffft. Aside from a 10 step process for identifying plant problems, this whole section was practically useless to me....even as a first time grower. The picture showing leaf deficiencies, etc.......worthless. Green on Green on a green background does not suit a diagram that is showing green leaves with lighter green splotches on it and saying it is a deficiency, looks exactly like the one next to it, which is also the overdose. Really hard to see what he is trying to show, which in my eyes like 70% of the other diagrams through the book, are a fail. Does not help at all. Throughout the text, you will find pictures to things that do not even belong in the chapter.....again.....random, like they are just trying to make the book look bigger.\n\nI'm pissed off about this book because I wanted a NON-ONLINE resource that would be a good go to and isn't really at all. I must be missing something. I don't want to RE-READ the book just to understand something that I need brushing up on. I should be able to use it as a QUICK reference, not something that takes time to read......again. I wanted this book, in order to avoid the highly opinionated and often time incorrect garbage that you find online. This book attempts at that, at least giving you a reasonably broad way of understanding without TOO MUCH opinion, but fails to impress on the CANNABIS GROWING 101 things deemed most important for newbies, and ends up being opinion. Perhaps I missed it, but this is why I am pissed off. Perhaps, this is due to the organization of the content and being forced to read the whole book and then somehow piece it all together in my head later.....after 700 pages.\n\nI am glad that I have a friend that has experience. I ended up leaning on him for information. This book alone, I would have been hopelessly lost a beginner.\n\nThis book mostly misses the mark in my opinion. It is detailed in some areas, but for a beginner, this book misses important things. As an experienced grower, you would not need this book and would have bought a different one.\n\nPretty pictures, but as a reference, with all of those pictures in weird places throughout the book.....absolutely not a GO TO resource for me. Not enough relevant data, which was surprising to me, considering the size and price of the book, even though the paper quality and print is really good.\n\nI would not recommend it to a friend. I wish I bought another, but in this world of online....being able to view your purchase before buying it, really is a disadvantage here. I lose.",
    "Has all the info you need to get started.if your just starting out then this is the book you want.",

    "Book is massive. All kinds of information. I never thought of . Great pictures. WOW People are so professional. high tech. Amazing. I just wanted to know about this new alternative medicine. And how not to be rip off if I decide try to make it helpful for my medical needs.",
    "This is hands down the best book you'll find on marijuana horticulture. I think it's better than Jorge Cervantes' bible, and I own both. This book goes above and beyond. You'll even learn how to create your own strain with this book, it even goes as far as how to smoke marijuana and make homemade pipes.\n\nI really like this book. If there was only one book I could buy on the subject, this is it. The book itself is college textbook size with almost 700 pages. I highly recommend it!",
    "I bought this book based on reviews and after receiving it today and reading through it a bit I have to say this book is garbage. Its just full of picture's and really not alot of actual information.\nThe author will tell you about for example hydroponics in 1/2 a page and then go on to tell you about different systems each one really quickly then moving on to the next subject and the whole book is like that no wonder it's over 600 hundred pages. Even if your a COMPLETE BEGINNER DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you like wasting your money. If your trying to learn to grow your much better off just watching YouTube videos. I just can't figure out why all the good reviews? I mean seriously, what are you supposed to learn from this book? I'm printing my shipping label and sending this TRASH Back tomorrow. This book is just a cash grab by the author plain and simple. Don't believe the hype.",
    "Poorly written, feels like a conversation with a stoner who never gets to the point. There's no info about led grow lights although they are mentioned several times. All the pictures are of industrial size grows which is impressive but useless to a small home grow.\nWish I hadn't wasted my money on this drivel there's more info on YouTube.",
    "The best guide I have found for growing in my many years of experience a very large and heavy and in depth book on many aspects of growing so like stressing ,topping etc also covers other areas of growing such as ventilation and dabs and what you can do with cannabis. would take a while to read through. A great guide. Loads of pictures as well and diagrams . Reasonable delivery time and value for money",
    "Amazing book if your just starting out or even a bit of a pro but guaranteed after reading this you will be awesome this book covers everything you need to know from setting up to taking down you wont need any other book or site forums to trouble shoot this is all you need",
    "There's so much information in this, it really is a Bible but don't let put you off. The information is written in clear English which is great, the imagery is beautiful and finished this book quite quickly considering the amount of detail in here. Bit pricey but worth it in my opinion. Would recommend 100%."

    "I am intrigued with the power of stories to bring new insight and even lead to transformation, and I am always on the hunt for how stories work, how they may be structured, and to what ends they may be used. That is what drew me to Rob Beisenbach’s book, Unleash the Power of Storytelling, and it did not disappoint.\n\nIgnore the fundamentals of storytelling, the author, contends, and “you could end up squandering an opportunity to change minds and even lives.” What makes stories this powerful? Beisenbach gives us six keys to impactful stories: (1) stories trigger an emotional response; (2) stories involve characters we can related to; (3) stories connect us; (4) they communicate what we value; (5) they raise the stakes; and (6) they show, rather than tell, what we stand for.\n\nSo what is a story? In simplest terms, it is “a character in pursuit of a goal in the face of some challenge or obstacle.” There are, of course, other elements in a story—a turning point, a climax, and more—but character, goal, and challenge are “the three legs of the stool.” Without these three, you don’t have a story.\n\nFor a story to work, the author says, you need the following elements: (1) a character who is a specific individual, (2) conflict (the tension between your character’s goal and the challenge facing your character, (3) something important at stake (a serious problem that cries out for action), (4) events connected to one another in a cause-effect relationship (rather than just a random series of events), and (5) an emotional response from the audience (frustration, disappointment, joy, etc.).\n\nA story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. In the beginning of the story, you set the scene and introduce the main character. Then, something happens (a challenge) that upsets the balance of things. The middle is where the character works to overcome the challenge, and the end is where things come to a resolution (the character either reaches his goal or doesn’t).\n\nThe best stories are the ones that come from our own experience, but whatever their source, our stories must show that (1) we know who our audience is, (2) we know what we want them to do (buy a product, work more efficiently, join our cause), (3) we have thought through the main challenges that are likely to get in the way of our goal, (4) we have found a character who has overcome one or more of those challenges, and (5) we have brought resolution to our story.\n\nThe importance of emotion cannot be underplayed in an effective story. In fact, claims Beisenbach, “facts don’t influence action the way an emotional appeal does.” He goes on to say that “emotion drives decision-making.” (People buy on emotion and justify their purchase with logic.) In order to reinforce the emotional impact of a story, the author suggests that the storyteller focus not just on what he or she does but on why they do it.\n\nThe goal of telling any story is an important consideration. For example, our goal may be to align our team with a certain strategy, or it may be to promote a brand. We might be seeking simply to establish common ground or even show others how humanly real we are. We may want to motivate a change in behavior, inspire a team, or establish trust and credibility with a customer. Whatever our goal, we should have it clearly in mind, and the story we’re telling should be directed toward that goal.\n\nCollecting stories is a lifelong pursuit—and a worthy one. You will have just the story you need when the time comes to tell it. Or, perhaps a story won’t be exactly what’s needed but a metaphor or an analogy will be. Beisenbach covers this skill as well.\n\nThis book has great value to anyone who seeks to communicate with others, motivating them and encouraging them. According to Beisenbach, there is power in storytelling. Our stories define who we are and what we stand for. They set us apart. So, think of a character with whom others can identify, lay out his or her goal and the challenges she or he faced in pursuing that goal, and bring the whole thing to resolution. And read Beisenbach’s book. He will be just the coach you need to impact the world around you for good.",
    "This is hands down the best book I’ve ever read!! Very detailed and provides a lot of exceptional simple tools that I will add to my tool belt.",
    "Fabulous book on storytelling. Fast delivery",
    "Did you know the best way to communicate anything important is through stories? It doesn’t matter whether its for a presentation at work, writing a book or article, talking with friends/family, or promoting a business etc. Our brains are just wired to process information through stories.\n\nThe author did a great job in breaking down the science storytelling all the way down to the bare bones. The information he shared was easy to digest and you can could tell, from reading the book, that he practices what he preaches. The information shared was insightful and engaging.\n\nSo if you want to learn on how to a better communicator, I highly recommend reading this book.",

    "Storytelling is hard. It draws on elements of communication, creativity, and performance. Most of us are bad at it. Even those who consider themselves \"natural storytellers\" have much to learn.\n\nI am one of those self-styled \"naturals.\" I work as a research scientist, though at heart I'm a teacher. Each data presentation is an opportunity to practice what I love most about my job, and over the years I have received much praise for clear and understandable slide decks. That's why I bought this book. I wanted to continue to develop something that I \"did well\" to carve out a unique niche in the company. I'm glad that I did because I still have quite a bit to learn about this art.\n\nThe lessons in this book are fantastic. Biesenbach wastes no time in extraneous detail and presents a simple algorithm to generate a story. It is a quick read overall with each chapter taking me less than 10 minutes to read (and I'm a slow reader!). This makes the book a great option for busy managers with \"no time\" and corporate book clubs alike.\n\nOne can construct their first story after just 40 pages. Although the earlier chapters seem geared toward executives and higher level managers, the later chapters on telling the company's origin story and personal branding are extraordinarily helpful for startups and job seekers respectively.\n\nI finished this book months ago and have used its principles in several data presentations, a major corporate presentation, and a pitch deck for funding. A coworker whom I greatly respect told me my latest data presentation was \"the best technical presentation she's seen in years.\" The corporate presentation was praised for its immersion and triggered multiple conversations that continued well into the next meeting. The pitch deck (\"telling the company origin with a story\") is now uniquely \"us\" as opposed to a cookie-cutter corporate pitch.\n\nAll this is to say that the lessons work. Which is big for us science types as interpersonal communication isn't necessarily a strong-point. Neither is taking the time to put one's self into the shoes of the audience and consider it from their perspective. Fortunately that should be improving as I pass this book around to interested coworkers!",
    "Very easy to read and of course uses stories (some times too much) everywhere to provide tips and tools. Recommended",
    "Amazing book! Very helpful when learning how to truly tell an interesting and heartfelt story!",
    "Overall Impression: Who is this for?\nI definitely recommend reading this book. If you are looking to improve your impact in the workplace, within your own business, or even on social media, I believe this book will prove very helpful. It is full of great examples, very well written and has a great, and easy to follow structure which makes it very straightforward to go back and find specific parts after you have finished reading the book.\n\nStructure and Content:\nThe book is split into three parts. In part one, Rob Biesenbach provides the foundation. He explains why stories are powerful, how a story should be structure, components it should have and how to do it yourself. In part two, the author explains how to \"polish\" your story, how to make it more efficient or focused and where to find inspiration. In part three, you will find various little guides on how to tell different kinds of stories, e.g. your company's origin story, how to use stories in presentations, how to tell your personal brand story and others.\n\nIf this review was helpful, please let me know by clicking the button below.",
    "I bought this book hoping to get tools and information on how to improve communication skills. However, the whole book is structured in a way that all the information is provided through mini-stories and you have to guess by yourself how to use that information to improve your skills.\nI was hoping for a little more guidance...",
    "This is a really good book on storytelling. I have *flicked* through a lot of storytelling books in the past but none have captured my interest or attention like this one.\n\nIt's fast-paced, easy to read, not bogged down by theory and jargon, and it's very practical - win, win all round!\n\nI also particularly liked the segment on corporate storytelling, which I’ll utilise in my current organisation. A great book for Communications professionals and entrepreneur/speakers alike.",
    "Very good narration and following the process through the book",
    "There aren't that many books of this nature that are both easy to absorb on the first occasion and useful to dip back into when you need a reminder. I found this to be a very useful guide to this topic; it has given me some helpful steers."

    "Easy to connect and most people can relate to what he is saying. This book does not only talk about finance it teaches you about real life lessons.",
    "I am a big fan of RK so take this with a grain of salt if you hate the guys guts.\nFirst off, I've been studying money books for almost two years. Most of them were for the middle class which told you to play it safe and diversify. Answers were little and fear was great. Basically, if you had a lot of time, you could at least retire adequately from those books.\nSo then I found RK last May and what a change! This was exactly what I was looking for: not people who couldn't walk the talk but people who had done it and done it well. Understand that RK and his wife lost most of their money and had to live with a friend (it's in their second or third book) but there's no shame in this per se as some people feel. This guy is basically telling you about his mistakes, at the risk of being attacked, and letting you avoid them.\nI've played CASHFLOW 101 about 30 times and moved on to 202 and have played it about a dozen times now. THe group I am with is positive and training their minds to see the invisible. One guy has already started to do r/e deals in Calif and while he is still looking around in a tough market like the Bay Area, he's moving along.\nRK's books are really about opening your mind to the possibilities as cliche' as it sounds. Once you decide to specialize in a particular investment vehicle (i.e. real estate, MLMS, stocks, etc), you will need to get the information from other sources.\nIn RDGTI, RK covers how he got started in investing. Now, some of this information will be out of your league unless you want to become a big time rich person but the most important thing is learning how he thinks. When you know he thinks, that will help you even more so in your future investments.\nThe important things RK's books do is give you smidgens of various fin. vehicles and, more importantly, teaches you to believe that the possibilities are out there.\nLet me stress that again: the possibilities ARE out there. The problem is: most Americans have trained their mind to believe there are very few and they cannot get them so they repeat this vicious circle. That's the biggest problem I've noticed since training my mind and learning.\nYou've got to believe and you have to start seeing the possibilities: or, seeing the invisible as RK calls it. Once you start doing that, you're on your way.\nAfter this book, check out his audio casette series RICH DAD'S GUIDE TO FINANCIAL LITERACY (advanced) or YOUR FIRST STEPS. You can also check him out at RICHDAD.COM . . .or, you can get these items for less at ebay or your public library or half.com\nThe important thing isn't so much as where you get it but that you use it, learn it and apply it.\nREVISION NOTE AS OF 09/05/03: I am at a loss for words as to why the RK books are getting slammed on Amazon. These are the books I started with two years ago, which inspired me to be more and never work a day job again. Since then, I won't say I haven't lost money but I've made more money and things are only looking up. Additionally, I've gotten involved with a group of other investors, who were all inspired by those books. In fact, if it wasn't for the RK books, I and my other colleagues wouldn't be on our ways to financial freedom.\nSo, when people slam RK and tell me it doesn't work, I just shake my head and realize that these are people who are living in their delussions. Everyday I'm surrounded by people who have accepted their financial cages and think things are too good to be true. Until they change their perceptions of abundance and money, they will forever be constricted.\nI used to think like that and had a dead end day job. Now, I'm making more than ever and, in less than five years, I plan to be financially free.\nGood luck to those who keep an open mind.",
    "As being the third and final book in the original Rich Dad's series, this book has done an exceptional job of both summarizing Robert's Rich dad's financial concepts AND deepening the essential knowledge to become a successful investor as well as to achieve the ultimate financial freedom.\n\nFor that same reason, the first half of the book can seem to be simply repeating the previous books' lessons, such as the cash flow quadrants, the true differences between assets and liabilities, the rich dad vs. poor dad stories; however, the second half of the book went into the extreme details of how to intelligently invest (e.g. how to calculate financial ratios to value a business and an investment opportunity, how to effectively operate your own business, or how to create passive income streams from investment).\n\nYou need to be patient when reading this book, especially if you have read the first two books in the serie. You will be able to gain a lot of new knowledge if you keep your mind opened and curious to learn. While I agree with some other negative comments that the book can be much more concise, I personally believe that the repetition of some critical lessons really help them stay much longer and deeper in my head. This book is thick and contains lots of financial advices, so I highly recommend it to people who have been following this serie and are debating if this book is worth it.\n\nNo, Robert will not give you the exact answers on which specific stocks to buy or what locations to build a house on. This book is not about that, and it should NOT be. Your investment portfolio should be built on the foundation of your financial needs and vision, not others' vision for your financial needs. Instead, Robert gave you rock-solid knowledge and foundation on financial literacy and investments so that you can build your OWN investment and business empire. Go for it, read this book, finish the serie, absorb the knowledge, and you will become a much better version of yourself. That is exactly what I have been able to get out from this serie, and I hope you will, too. Again, I highly recommend this book.",
    "Robert is an amazing writer. His rich dad is a legendary investor who's princples are powerful and transformational. Please read this book if you want to become a better investor.",
    "Loved the book. Read it within a month. I just wish there were books made to skip all the clutter and get straight to the point of the important details.",
    " Personal studies",
    "I have to imagine that all of the reviews complaining about the repetitive nature of this book - in relation to what was said in the previous two - came from people who did not finish reading the book.\n\nYes, the first half or so of this has already been covered in Rich Dad, Poor Dad and Cashflow Quadrant - but the second half of the book covers key concepts in financial literacy; such as what to look for and analyse in financial statements.",
    "Dies ist bereits nach Rich Dad Poor Dad und Cashflow Quadrant mein drittes Buch von Robert Kiyosaki und das bisher beste in meinen Augen.\n\nDas finde ich gut:\n- einfach geschriebenes Englisch, so dass es auch nicht Muttersprachler verstehen (B2 Niveau ist ausreichend, um es flüssig lesen zu können)\n- Typisches US-Taschenbuchformat, d.h. trotz 600 Seiten super handliches Buch\n- Kiyosaki untermauert seine Thesen mit netten Anekdoten\n- Es wird viel Basis und auch fortgeschrittenes Wissen über das Investieren und das Investitionen schaffen vermittelt. Es geht dabei hauptsächlich um die mentale Haltung, als um konkrete Investitionen\n- Es wird wieder sehr deutlich und toll erklärt, wieso Kiyosaki den Cashflow für das A und O bei einer Investition hält.\n- Englische Version deutlich günstiger mit 5,99 bzw 6,99 (deutsche 29,99)\n\nNicht gefallen hat mir:\n- Kiyosaki wiederholt sich einfach viel zu viel. Es ist mir bereits aus seinen vorherigen Büchern bekannt und auch hier übertreibt er es mit unzähligen Wiederholungen, ja eher Vervielfachungen gar, was ich auf Dauer störend finde.\n\nAlles in allem ist es dennoch ein sehr gelungenes und lesenswertes Buch und sollte von jedem Investor oder auch von dem der es werden möchte gelesen werden.\n\nIch hoffe ich konnte Ihnen mit meiner Rezension weiterhelfen und würde mich über eine positive Bewertung freuen.",
    "This book could have been written in maximum 100 pages, it is full of ridiculous repetition, half way through the book and havent learned anything more than what hat I have from his other book Cashflow Quadrant.\n\nA one paragraph point is made a chapter long...\n\nAnd every now and then authers training courses and other products are mentioned, so you are in a loop from one book to another and from one product to other.\n\nI think the auther need to take the rubish out, and sell this as a small 100 page book, will make more sense.\n\nThanks,",
    "I am a great admirer of Robert's earlier work such as Rich Dad Poor Dad, and Cash Flow Quardrant, but I found that this book did'nt contain any new financial ideas or insight.\nHe introduced concepts like the importance of having a financial plan and financial education. However, this information is already available in the miriad of self help books out there. I felt that all the worthwhile information in this book could have been condensed into 100 pages instead of 469 pages.",
    "This book is both inspiring and and informative. My worldview has completely changed it's as though the scales have fallen from my eyes! I have completely different ambitions and goals after reading this book. If you enjoyed the first rich Dad Poor Dad book you will definitely enjoy this one too."

    "This is one of best books I have ever read. I was new to short term rental world. This book walks you through the entire process from identifying the location, identifying the property, analyzing the property, putting it under contract, preparing it for short term rental, setting up the accounts with the hosting platforms, PMS and dynamic pricing, and then managing it for guest satisfaction and optimizing the revenue.\nThe entire journey is made so easy.\nAlong the journey it walks you through what to do and more importantly what NOT to do.\nThe style of narrative is very simple, crisp and to the point.\nA must read for all the investors wanting to get into STR space or that are already in STR space.",
    "I have pre-ordered this book when I stumbled upon Avery on Bigger Pockets. This book is gold! My husband and I have been thinking of Real Estate for years now and have not had some downtime with our 11addresses worth of moves until settling here in Virginia with our 2little kids.\n\nI started looking and learning everything I could, from forums to reaching out and networking this past year and quite honestly haven't had enough courage to pull the trigger again. We put an offer on a beach home this past month and were discouraged that despite offering 20k over, we were outbid along with the 22 other offers the sellers received. We were disheartened, to say the least and started thinking we should pause our process.\n\nThen came this book in the mail!!! I finished this book in less than 24 hours, along with my highlighter and page markers! I could not put this book down! This book is so great, I feel inspired and pumped to venture out, and even greater my husband who was the more skeptic between the two of us is as pumped as me. I was reciting paragraphs to him of things that we could relate so much, which really the entire book! By the time I was finished, he was more confident and is ready to make offers!!! This was the extra boost we were missing!\n\nI could go on for days how great this book is! Anyone who is thinking of real estate should definitely give this book a read! It was easy, simple, concise, and direct to the point!",
    "Great introduction book on STR’s. Recommended reading for anyone interested in STR’s. Lots of useful tips throughout the book. Easy to read, not condensending.",
    "Avery is the expert on short term rentals. She breaks down exactly how to run one, from afar, and makes it feel possible and realistic. I’m currently working with her company, the short term shop, to purchase my first STR and I couldn’t be more excited.",
    "I found this short term rental book helpful and very well written. I'm about to embark on my short term first rental property and there was a ton of useful information in this book. The little anecdotes were very helpful. I especially liked the chapter on the cleaning and how important it is to build out your team.",

    "This book doesn't follow the classic set of FIRE formulas (if you do want that, I would recommend JL Collins’s “The Simple Path to Wealth”). Sam approaches things in his own unique way. The results of which are a large collection of rules and frameworks for how you should approach life decisions in the most optimal way on your path to financial independence.\n\nHe pushes you to think in terms of probabilities of success and focus on making decisions where a positive outcome will happen at least 70% of the time while still being humble enough to accept failure 30% of the time.\n\nThe book challenged me a lot in the first section. Sam’s advice on how much you should target to FIRE is extremely different to the more common calculations and those I personally use. Sam pushes on an income focused approach as well as emphasis on passive income.\n\nI like reading books that offer me a different way to think about a problem. I know the core of a Bogel Head or Mr. Money Mustache type FIRE approach. Reading another book about this wouldn’t incrementally add to how I already think. Sam accomplishes that for me perfectly with this book, highly incremental. If you strictly follow his advice you will end up with way more money than I think you would ever need… but that’s not exactly the worst outcome in the world. He also has me thinking harder about my own Real Estate exposure (nearly 0% at the moment) and other options at generating passive income vs just relying on a portfolio withdrawal rate in FIRE.\n\nEverything I have covered thus far is not even 1/3rd of the book. The rest of the book goes deep into thinking about where to live throughout your life, how to approach your career, job hopping vs sticking around (has a really good analogy of being like Nick Saban and not John Wooden), severances, side hustles, education, love, children, stealth wealth, and so much more that I really learned from.\n\nSam writes from the experience of someone who FIRE’d at the tail end of The Great Recession. For those in Tech in 2022 there are a lot of parallels to what Sam went through in his finance career in 2008-2012. I was also able to relate more since he actually lived (lives still) in San Francisco after working in New York and talks from experience the benefits these VHCOL locations can have on your career.",
    "I've already achieved financial independence and am close to retiring at age 60...BUT I sure wish I would have read this when I was 25. I'd have twice as much money and would have retired much younger.\n\nSam does a great job of helping you to lay out a plan and make the best choices to get you to your goals. I also love that he reminds us to be humble and \"undercover\". My Dad always taught me not to discuss money or how much I make. Good advice then, and good advice now. When nobody knows what you earn, it is much easier not to feel as if you have to keep up with the Joneses.\n\nI'm not 100% sure I agree with his car buying advice to keep it at 10% of your annual salary but that was about the only place I took pause - the rest is great advice!",
    "I was fortunate to have had a one on one consultation with Sam about six years prior to my early retirement in 2021 - It was time well spent. Sam no longer offers consults but this book is an excellent alternative. The entire book is an easy read while also being very comprehensive and data packed. I really appreciate that this book is lightweight as I have challenges gripping things for very long after too many years using non-ergonomic computer keyboards and mice. A bonus is the “Further Reading” section which has references to his blog articles which I’ve found invaluable over the years. No need for a financial planner if you have time to do a bit of research on your own and a passion for learning. Sam’s website has saved me thousands so far as I confidently (and so far successfully) manage our portfolio of various assets. Keep up the awesome work Sam - The world needs more kind, humble, and sharp people like you!",
    "A great book, covering so many important real life decisions. I follow Financial Samurai's blog and got an early copy as soon as it came out. I will be entering my 30's very soon and this book actually gives me a great perspective on how to manage my finances, how to be smart and invest and not spend money and think more ahead. The truth is that I had never thought about this when I started working in sinces my 18's because I often lived the day-to-day life that is very typical of my culture or the way I was raised, but the recommendations that I find in this book are really useful for making important decisions that they involve money, work, housing, investments, children and much more.",
    "As a real estate investor and owner of a real estate management company and brokerage, I was concerned I might not be properly diversified in my investments. After reading through his recommended portfolio mixes by age, and that bonds and dividend-paying stocks could be replaced with real estate, I felt better about my current portfolio. There are a few semantics I may not agree with 100%, but overall the book is a solid read for anyone - whether just starting out and needing a roadmap or a seasoned investor who wants to verify they're on the right track.",
    "Great read! I’m a longtime follower of Sam’s blog, Financial Samurai, and although most of the topics have been covered in his blog throughout the years, it was a pleasure to read from cover to cover in such an organized format. Sam is the real deal—not lean FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early). For so long I incorporated most of his advice in my life and it’s paying off. I would label this book a Bible of sorts on how to make the most of life while we are on Earth for such a short time, with an emphasis placed on attaining financial freedom but only to truly enjoy the byproduct of more time to do what you want and spending more time with those you care about.\n\nHighly recommend.",
    "I could call this book \"The Wealthy Barber for the 21st century\" but that doesn't do it justice. The advice is specific, actionable, customizable, and full of practical how-to-do it formulas & tables based on real-world analysis and experience. Yes, he suggest levels of saving and discipline that most of us would balk at, and the truly poor couldn't possibly do - but let's face it, the truly poor aren't his audience and probably aren't buying this book.

    "I like how this was pretty much a text book but read like a field manual for trading and technical analysis, the book cover said it retails for 80 dollars but its much cheaper here, and I would say it was worth it. Also, a lot of the methods described in the book are well known, but gives you insight into the \"why\" it works- the book does show its age at times yet the technical methods given could really apply to all markets. I do wish it went a into explaining the order book and how that can relate back to TA, but many of the topics that I first thought were confusing and giving me mixed signals are now strong interpretations of the market. Good book and im going to look for others like it.",
    "This book clearly outlines every fundamental aspects you need to know about technical analysis, and it's applicable to any market. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to get into trading financial markets.",
    "The book in it of itself is great. I only give it a 4 star for it’s physical quality. My product came with a slightly damaged spine, incorrectly cut pages, and groups of pages which seem to stick together. Although this does not effect true purpose of the book, of course, just me nitpicking.",
    "Very Very Very Nicely Organized and presented pre requisite to Technicaly Analysis.",
    "Extensive and perhaps dated in some areas but an excellent guide to all forms of trading",
    "It is entirely possible to spend more time reading trading books than doing any actual trading. This is one of the few books that will remain on my bookshelf and I highly recommend it FOR WHAT IT IS INTENDED - an excellent reference on technical analysis (TA).\n\nWhat I was looking for was something to provide clear, concise descriptions on various technical indicators across all types - trend analysis, price patterns, candles, oscillators, etc. And Murphy not only does this well, but his work provides enough information that I do not see the need for another book on TA on my bookshelf, even though I know that other very good books are available (e.g. Pring). But this one is enough for me. It is well organized and indexed so that I can rapidly look up something while I am setting up trades and get the basic info that I need.\n\nOne surprise was how well written the book was and how much I enjoyed reading it. I expected a dry reference book but instead found an excellent and engaging read, perhaps with the exception of the chapter on point and figure which was not up to the rest of the book. (If you are completely new to TA, you might find it less entertaining, but in comparison to the dry tome that I expected when the monster-sized book arrived, Murphy is remarkable in his ability to convert most TA topics and examples into 'normal' English.) He also is not a proponent or zealot about any one indicator type, which I appreciate. He does a good job of describing each within the context of its value without trying to convert anyone to any specific indicator. As I do not believe in magic bullets in trading, I appreciate his straightforward approach.\n\nLet me also note what this book is NOT so that you do not buy it for the wrong reasons:\n\na) As you should gather from the above, this is not a trading system. Murphy will not tell you which indicators to use most or in which combinations to produce the best results. He will provide insight into many indicators and classes of indicators but he is NOT trying to convince you to use any specific indicator in any specific way. So he doesn't try to convince you of WHAT to use, just helps you understand WHEN, WHY and HOW each indicator type is used by various traders.\n\nb) Also, this is NOT intended to be the complete, in depth statement on any of the topics covered. For example, his section on Candlestick formations is simple, clear and includes many examples, but it is undoubtedly not the same as picking up Nison's works on Candlesticks. Similarly, you can find many books dedicated to Elliot Waves, Fibonaccis and other topics. Murphy provides the basics, but do not expect as thorough an explanation or justification as a dedicated book would provide. Then again, expect a dedicated book to try and convince you why its particular system or method is so much better than any other, something that Murphey will not try to do to you!\n\nc) Finally, this book is NOT intended to convert people who do not accept TA into believers. Frankly, it is much easier to get most people to accept that `fundamental analysis' affects a stock's value and price, but it is harder for most to understand and accept that simply analyzing the stock's price and related indicators can predict future moves. Murphy's opening chapters include some simple basic background on TA, but verbal explanations have limited value in convincing a pure `fundamentalist' that properly used technical analysis works. The only way to break down this barrier, IMO, is simply to learn and use various indicators for a while to begin seeing how predictive they can be. Murphy does not try to convert - he simply provides a learning reference. From there, anyone using TA needs to practice to become proficient.\n\nSo, in summary, I highly recommend buying this book for what it is intended to be - a reference book on technical analysis. It does this job excellently.",
    "Great introduction, or even advanced introduction compared to some other books, to a wide array of technical analysis thinking and tools. Great book to give the big picture of what’s available out there to use in your own trading strategy.",
    "This is an excellent book for someone who knows their market basics, and perhaps a little technical analysis, and wants to move toward a more intermediate level in the subject. The book is extremely clear, well-written, and balanced in its coverage. In a field with much poor writing and extravagant claims it's almost a joy to read (if one is so inclined). It was easy to spend the better part of an evening getting through 100 or more pages without getting confused or bogged down, or feeling like it was hard work. I found most all of it very thought provoking.\n\nWhile the book basically focuses on trend-following techniques -- about which I have many reservations -- the book also covers numerous contrarian tools as a way to time an entry into the predominant trend during a shorter-term pause/pull-back/consolidation period. The emphasis is as much on charting techniques as on strictly numerical indicators, and Murphy is probably at his best in explaining how best to use this or that item in the toolbox to ones advantage and what its limitations are and what can go wrong. The overall tone is very solid and realistic. I especially liked his clear exposition of the important differences between the futures/commodities markets (where many of these techniques originated) and the stock market.\n\nI'm marking it down one tick for a couple of reasons. First, I would have liked more quantitative depth; qualitative discussions such as this can only take one so far toward actual applications. Second, there's virtually nothing here on options and their effects on the markets; the same could be said about computerized trading systems (some coverage but not nearly enough). Third, there were a couple of glaring ommisions: in talking about saucer bottoms he doesn't mention the well-known tea-cup-with-handle formation even though the handle shows clearly on the chart he uses to illustrate it; when talking about simple moving averages he neglects to mention the important \"box-car\" effect of big changes moving out the tail end of the averaging period; and while Wilder's RSI gets plenty of good coverage the recipe for it he gives is a bit misleading in that it only allows one to construct the first value, not any subsequent values. And, fourth, I think he gives period analysis and Elliott wave theory more attention than is deserved and never mentions the application of Fourier techniques in this arena; I could say much the same with regard to ideas based on Fibonacci numbers (perhaps I'm yet unconvinced in these areas). So the book could have been better in some places.\n\nFor their historical significance I especially liked all the charts from the 1997-9 time period which show things in the glory days just before the top of the market bubble in 2000: Intel at $100 ($20 today), Bristol Meyers at $95 ($20-25 today), crude oil at $16, etc. [I was trading Micron (pg 127) actively during the period when it spiked to $60 ($12-13 recently) and remember those days well]. So the many charts used to illustrate various things were a bonus to me, though they remind me there was no mention of market manias and how to correctly read extremes and their subsequent breakdowns. Perhaps it would have been asking too much for a closing chapter prognosticating the future as he saw it then, though it would have been interesting had he thought to write such a chapter. This is still a very good book for what it is. 4+ stars.",
    "My advice: don't bother with the smaller cheaper books if you're going to get this in the end. It's the proverbial dog's gametes. Just get this. Also get the hardcover, these books with constant diagrams will drive you mad on Kindle. Learnt the hard way, there...",
    "Very well written and easy to read/absorb, great source of information and knowledge that applies to all the markets. In short, this is a solid buy for anyone looking to advance their understanding of technical analysis. I recommend digesting at least one chapter a day, then when finished, go back to the start and read it again. Keep doing that and you'll definitely have an advantage over people who are 'winging it'. All in all, zero regrets in buying it and consider it a solid investment.",
    "i think the author wrote the book in a very easy and engaging way considering the subject matter. I'm no financial wizard but i can easily understand the way he explains the concepts and makes them very real and practical. He obviously knows his stuff. I'd thoroughly recommend the book to anyone interested in learning more about the subject",
    "Absolutely fantastic book, the depth of detail and subject analysis is amazing. This really is the bible of technical analysis and deserves to be on the shelf of anybody looking to trade. Highly recommended. Don't hesitate to purchase if you are looking to learn about technical analysis from the ground up.",
    "Everything you need to know to read charts etc, explains basic principles to more advanced also. Great for all levels. So good to read and go back to."

    "This book is brilliant.\nI cannot decide what I loved most about it – whether it was the superb conversational tone, amazingly solid business advice or that Allan actually preaches what he practices (which happens depressingly rare nowadays).\n\nAre there any flaws in “The 1-Page Marketing Plan?” Only perceived ones and only a few. Let’s start with them.\nCons\n\n1. Give them what they want…\nThe author tricks you into buying the book with his 1-page slogan. And he provides that indeed. But it’s just the tip of the tip of the iceberg. You get the tip and the whole iceberg attached to it.\n…then give them what they need.\nAnd it’s a huge iceberg to swallow. The amount of content condensed into this book is mind-blowing.\n\n2. More for Rookies.\nThis book is ideal for people who are getting their feet wet in the entrepreneurial world. I found only a couple missing elements in the whole structure of Allan’s business program. But it also means that if you have some experience in business you have probably heard of or lived through most of the advice provided in the book.\n\nOn the plus side, Allan has a talent for conveying his points in a way that penetrates thick skulls. So, even if it’s something you are familiar with it still may make you take action.\n\n3. Missing puzzles.\nWhat small business owners need is a full operation manual for their businesses and the author provides just that. With two exceptions I could put my finger on: there is nothing, or very little, about a vision for your business and idea validation at its early stages. Yeah, I know, it’s nitpicking. 1-page Marketing Plan is dedicated to existing business owners and assumes they have a vision and validated their idea. However, if you cover the whole picture, you shouldn’t make exceptions.\n\nPROS\n\n1. From Practice.\nI cannot praise the author enough for his book marketing. I make a living as a book advertiser. Gosh! So many authors, even business book authors, have no clue about it. I need to teach them basics before we can even start.\nAllan Dib is a superb marketer. His book is #1 in a competitive category and it ranks high consistently, meaning he knows how to actually sell his own book.\n\nThe same experience shines through the pages of his book. Allan has been there and done that. “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” is not a theoretical thesis. It comes straight from experience. I appreciate this very much.\n\n2. Advice\nAs I mentioned in the ‘Cons’ section, Allan shares much more than a single marketing tactic. His business advice is rock solid and truly comprehensive. It is also up to date like a few business books are. For example, the utmost emphasis on tracking your marketing campaigns is, of course, common sense, but in the modern world it is also a must.\n\n“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” – John Wanamaker\n“It should be a crime to say that today.” – Allan Dib\n\nAllan is not shy about admitting that he borrows heavily from Gerber and his “E-Myth.” If you want to build a real business, not just a new job without a boss (and without a stable salary), you need systems and processes. Your marketing needs a system and processes as well and “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” tells you exactly how to implement them.\n\nThe business advice shared in the book is especially valuable for business rookies who haven’t yet read everything from the business shelf in the library.\n\n3. Wisdom.\nAllan Dib’s advice does not focus only on systems and processes. His business acumen is enormous and he is generous in sharing it. For me, it was especially visible when he talks about relationships with customers. I need to nurture those relationships not consider them a given. Allan also knows which particular stories to share to make his point memorable. The story of a car salesman opened my eyes to what it means to keep relationships with customers alive.\n“Everybody is in sales” was another business wisdom nugget I got from “The 1-Page Marketing Plan.”\nAnd author’s assessment about big organizations was right on the spot:\n\n“Poor service, indifferent staff, and out-of-touch management are hallmarks of large companies.”\n\nI’ve been working in a corporate environment my whole career and there are no words that describe this world more aptly.\n\nI also liked very much whenever Allan gave arguments about why small businesses actually have advantage over big corporations, if they do their marketing right.\n\nAnother of his gems:\n\n“Word of mouth is the business equivalent of a free lunch.”\n\nThat’s so true. It’s amazing when it happens, but depending on free meals is not a strategy to support your family or create a business.\n\nFiring problematic customers, not basing your business on a single snow leopard, how to give outrageous guarantees and many other wisdom gems were hidden among this book’s pages.\n\n4. Storytelling.\nWhile many of the things Allan teaches about in his book were not new to me, his storytelling is so superb that many things I knew only intellectually finally penetrated to the gut level.\n\nFor example, I knew very well that it’s so much more effective to keep an existing customer than to attract a new one. They taught me this in my economy classes at university 20 years ago! But only after reading the “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” it dawned on me how downright stupid it is to neglect your past and existing customers and chase new clients instead.\n\nI’m a numbers guy and I was impressed at how Allan used numbers to illustrate his points.\nThus, even if you “kind of” already know everything about marketing, systems, processes and keeping your customers satisfied, reading “The 1-Page Marketing Plan” will not be waste of your time. The author’s persuasion skills may refresh your knowledge and implement what you know intellectually into practice.\n\n5. 1-Page\nAnd yes, there is a 1-page marketing plan included in the book.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s well worth the book’s price. Even the principle that you should have only one place, one sheet, to picture your whole marketing plan with a single glance is worth the price. We are so distracted in the modern world. This single piece may serve you as a single point of focus that will keep your monkey brain glued to the importance of marketing plan for your business.\n\nSo, even if you already know everything Allan teaches about marketing, customer satisfaction, market research, systems and processes and all that stuff, but you didn’t have your whole marketing plan put on a single sheet, you need to read “The 1-Page Marketing Plan”\n\nBy the way, the plan is thoroughly well-laid out in a chronological and logical order. It’s a masterpiece. I’m going to use it in my business.",
    "Persuaded:\nI will admit that I picked this book up with grave misgivings. I was asked by the author’s assistant to review the book but declined to do so. Coincidentally, a week later, one of my clients was looking for a way to get his leadership team on the same page when it came to marketing and sales. So, I picked up the Kindle version of the book and promised I’d let him know what I thought.\n\nBy the time I finished the introduction, I was shaking my head in agreement with Mr. Dib. Halfway through the book, I was confident enough to recommend that my client get the book for himself. Let me explain some of the reasons why I believe this book is worth your time to read.\n\nLayout:\nThe chapters are in a logical order that builds from one marketing principle to another while working toward completing the plan. There are frequent referrals between concepts that tie everything together.\n\nI appreciate the way Dib starts each chapter with a summary and a list of what he will be telling you in that chapter. Then, at the end of each chapter, he has an action item and instructions for filling in one block of the nine-block marketing plan.\n\nMarketing:\nIt is refreshing to read that Dib believes there is no longer (and maybe never was) a reason for not doing the work of determining the return on investment (ROI) for your marketing budget. Technological advances in digital media make parts of the ROI equation very easy to manage. Print media is also much more targeted and traceable than in the past. So, no excuses! Continuous improvement in marketing effectiveness is possible and required for a well-run business.\n\nDib also dispels the myth that print and direct marketing are \"dead,\" or dying. He drives home the concept that all the media can be useful and should be used in a mix that is most effective for your target market. Also, yes, some of the determination of the proper combination will be trial-and-error which is why measuring is so critical.\n\nOn the target market subject, Dib suggests that a narrow focus is best. We cannot be all things to all people in all markets. Combine a narrow focus with the creation of a customer avatar, and you will be able to create a powerful model for marketing and sales personnel to use as a guide for their work.\n\nThere are many other great tips and ideas for a highly effective marketing program; too many to itemize here. As I mentioned above, it is well worth your time to read what Dib has to say.\n\nSales:\nMarketing and sales are very closely intertwined. Generally, the sales process is where I disagree with most sales and marketing trainers or authors on these topics. Try as they might, they cannot seem to get to the point where they stop making the process about making the sale. Many start out saying the right things: “It’s about the buyer; You must add value; You must build trust, etc.\" Then, inevitably, they wind up inculcating tactics that make things all about the salesperson making the sale. Find out what your customer needs – so you can make the deal. Build a relationship with your customer, because that is what will make them comfortable placing the order. Always be closing.\n\nDib has come the closest I've seen so far to reaching my own sales philosophy – if you want someone to buy, stop selling. People want to buy; they do not want to be sold – no matter how pleasant you are as a salesperson. Today, if I want or need something, I have researched it already, and I either have it or have decided it’s not in my budget. Therefore, if you’re trying to manipulate me (no matter what fancy tactic you use) into purchasing something I don’t need or can’t afford, then you’re serving yourself and not me as the customer.\n\nThe most egregious sales tactics today are those based on neuroscience. They are designed to use new knowledge about how the human brain works to manipulate people into doing what you want them to do rather than help them understand what it is they want to do. To me, doing that is evil. As a vendor, my job is to be found. That, being found, is why this book is so important and worth reading.\n\nDefinitions:\nDib uses an interesting story to define some of the common terms we use around marketing and sales. “Here's the simplest, most jargon-free definition of marketing you're ever likely to come across: If the circus is coming to town and you paint a sign saying, ‘Circus Coming to the Showground Saturday,’ that’s advertising. If you put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into town, that’s promotion. If the elephant walks through the mayor’s flower bed and the local newspaper writes a story about it, that’s publicity. And if you get the mayor to laugh about it, that’s public relations. If the town’s citizens go to the circus, you show them the many entertainment booths, explain how much fun they’ll have spending money at the booths, answer their questions and, ultimately, they spend a lot at the circus, that’s sales. And if you planned the whole thing, that’s marketing.”\n\nAs you might imagine, my difficulty is only with the portion that states, you “explain how much fun they’ll have spending money at the booths.” Just show them the booths. They’ll figure out if they want to spend time and money having fun.\n\nBottom Line:\nAs I said, Dib comes closest to meeting my \"don't sell\" sales philosophy. Moreover, he is right on target with the marketing, branding, and promoting philosophy. This book is the most lucid and most thorough book on this topic that I've read to date. Also, Dib has more useful resources on his website for those who want to dig deeper. I highly recommend the 1-Page Marketing Plan.",
    "I really enjoyed this book. I recommend this book to anyone who is starting or growing their business. This book gave me clarity and focus and and a transformational guide of action taking steps to implement now. It will transform and improve your way of thinking. A marketing plan is important. It helps align the clarity and focus we are all seeking when we are overwhelmed with the business we initially created through our passion and purpose. This is the next step that’s business and life changing!",
    "Loved the book, found it valuable. I'm your typical 'founded a business 20 years ago success,' forgotten more than most people ever learned about running a small business, and then stumbled across your book that reminded me of just how much I had forgotten, and how much I was losing because of it. There are tons of statements along the line of \"it's not what you know but what you think you know that can hurt you\" - yada yada yada, but this book was also a good example - to me at least - of \"it's not what you think you know, but what you've forgotten you knew that can hurt you.\"\nThanks for a nice concise reminder book.",
    "Starting with step one, it was easy to follow what I need to cover to get to my ultimate marketing plan. It was easy to read and had lots of examples to dive into. If you need something easy to read to get the job done quickly, this is it. There is very little \"fluff\" to the book.",
    "Thorough, concise and full of valuable information. It should be required reading for anyone starting or owning a business",
    "After struggling with marketing for many years I feel eternally grateful to have gotten this book!",
    "This book really gave me so much perspective and motivation to make some changes in my business\nIncredible book!! Highly recommend",
    "This is the best book ive ever read. for years ive struggled, having a couple failed business under my belt. This is not for making a business plan, business plans are all about setting up your store, getting loans, paying taxes. all irrelevant if you have no customers. This book is the solution. You read the book through and at the end of each chapter fill in the square on the page. I personally chose to read each chapter, read it again answering the questions in a notebook, then transfer my answers to the one page marketing plan template. The questions in each chapter force you to think about things in a way i've never found so simple before. This isnt a quick one page formula, this is an excellent book that guides you to get the answers you need from yourself, and put them all in order in a way that sheds a lot of light onto the sale techniques you can use, the opportunities your missing out on, and the things youre doing wrong. Its taken me four days to complete the whole plan upto now. I have one more quare left to fill and then im going to read the whole thing one more time and analyse my answers to make sure ive got a fully watertight plan. ive attached a pic of how the plan looks as you fill it in. right now i feel more excited, confident, and raring to go than ive ever felt before. Its time to make this dream real.",
    "This book is brilliant!\n\nClear and straight to the point, all delivered in plain no-nonsense English.\n\nI've read, and struggled through, many books on Marketing and on more than one occasion had the feeling the authors were being paid by the word, as theory and explanations were consistently drawn out and laboured.\n\nBut no here.\n\nAllan's book gets to the point with quality information, and also offers lots of advice on actually implementing the concepts in the real world.\n\nIf you need to get your marketing up and running, and need a guide, this book is it.\n\n100% recommended!",
    "I would give this book six stars if I could. If you're an entrepreneur, it will change your life. If you're not, you will still find it extremely interesting. I've genuinely enjoyed every page. I completely recommend it and at £2 on Kindle, there's no excuse.",
    "The 80/20 rule states that 80% of a book's content is filler. Well, this book contains almost no filler! A practical and easy read, The 1-Page Marketing Plan is a great resource for every entrepreneur.\n\nHowever, there's a problem: I read this immediately after reading Donald Miller's Building a Storybrand.\n\nBoth books cover the same topic: marketing. But compared to the 9-step process in The 1-Page Marketing Plan, Building a Storybrand has a 3-step process.\n\nAnd while The 1-Page Marketing Plan is more \"complete,\" the storytelling and ecosystem of Building a Storybrand makes it one of my favourite books.\n\nWhat do I mean by ecosystem? You can find videos of Donald Miller reviewing websites, helping people with their elevator pitches, and more, for free on YouTube.\n\nThe 1-Page Marketing Plan is still a great read. Allan Dib did a great job of cutting out the clutter. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend grabbing a copy. Why? Because I have no regrets buying/reading The 1-Page Marketing Plan.",
    "A well presented book, and a must read for every entrepreneur. Lots of golden nuggets for both the new and the experienced entrepreneur.\n\nFilling out the nine components of the one-page marketing plan will force you to think through the most critical aspects of your business marketing - an exercise that could save you a lot of pain in the future.\n\nThis is a book I won’t recommend to a competitor, but to everyone else, grab a copy now!\n\nThanks, Allan - I’m now part of your “tribe”."

    "I learned a lot from this book – enough to earn it 5 stars. I learned not just about bitcoin, but money in general. Despite its flaws, I recommend this book even to those who don’t care about bit coin. It’s a good overview of the history of money and how it works.\n\nHowever, there are two flaws the reader has to look past to get the most from this book.\n\nOne is repetition, especially towards the end. Sadly, this is commonplace these days. Authors have 70-80 pages of material but seem to feel like it’s not a real book unless they can turn it into 250-300 pages. I’ll pay for a short, concise book if it has something valuable to say.\n\nThe second flaw is more unique to this book. The author strays far from his subject matter to poop all over all kinds of things.\n\nHe clearly despises John Maynard Keynes. That’s fine. But Keynes’ personal life has nothing to do with the subject of this book. And usually when an author resorts to attacking a person rather than that person’s ideas, that means the author’s ideas can’t stand up to the ideas it is criticizing, and thus has to attack the person behind the ideas to distract the reader.\n\nThis is an unfortunate “self-own” / own-goal by Ammous, because his ideas clearly have merit. He should have let them stand on their own. The second half of Chapter 5 and parts of Chapter 7 can be skipped by anyone interested solely in the topic the book purports to cover.\n\nHe also poops all over modern society and sees the era of the gold standard as a utopia that would return if we simply used bitcoin. For example, “Any industry in which people complain about their [jerk] boss is likely part of the [problem of loose money] because bosses can only really afford to be [jerks] in [this] economic fake reality….” In his hard-money utopia, “bosses who mistreat their workers will either lose the workers to competitors or destroy their business quickly.” Does he not remember that in the era of hard money he longs for many bosses literally owned and beat their workers? Hard money doesn't guarantee a society free of jerk bosses.\n\nAnd can one really consider the rocket engine and transistor simply iterations on or somehow less significant inventions than the internal-combusting engine and lightbulb? Based on Ammous commentary you’d have to believe that.\n\nHe resorts to evidence-free assertions that the arts, culture, and society of yesteryear are better than today’s. None of this is empirically verifiable, and more importantly, none of it is relevant to his arguments about. “It was hard money that financed Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos while easy money financed Miley Cyrus’s twerks.” Please. There was plenty of the equivalent of twerking happening in Bach’s day, and there is art produced the last few decades that will last for centuries. The anguish he cites of Michelangelo over his art reminds me of Leonard Cohen’s over some of his, despite Leonard Cohen being part of our debauched soft-money era. And the poem he cites from Michelangelo is no more void of ego than some of the modern pop artists the author disdains. The author cherry-picks once-in-a-century artists of the past and compares them to some of the basest performers of today, a false comparison, and one he doesn’t even pretend to back up with any evidence or argument.\n\n“[O]nly long pretentious diatribes shaming others for not understanding the work give it value.” This is his criticism of modern artists. The lack of irony with which he writes this, given it describes the exact chapter it appears in, shows a sad lack of self-awareness. He should have kept these off-topic opinions to himself rather than letting it soil what is otherwise the really solid case he is making.\n\nAll of this is a sad and distracting (as evidenced by how much I’m writing about these digressions compared to the book as a whole) digression from the point of his thesis. It really deserves reducing my rating by 2-stars. But because I still recommend this book despite those flaws, I’m only deducting 1 star and giving it a 4-star rating.",
    "The title \"The Bitcoin Standard\" may prompt one to believe that this book is about all the nooks and crannies of Bitcoin, but I see this book more like a fantastic historical essay on the origins of money as a preliminary step to answering the question of what constitutes sound money. Apart from revisiting the virtues of gold and the pitfalls of Fiat money, the book explains systematically what are the distinguishing properties of sound money, why is Bitcoin very likely to fix the most serious problems created by Fiat money and why money is not a social construct. Furthermore, Saifedean Ammous will most likely make you radically change your mind about the origins of a the Great Depression, inflation and the \"intellectual legacy\" ( note the quotation marks) of both Keynesians and the monetarist wing of the libertarian movement. You will never again see our current political leaders in the same way after reading this book. The book ends with a concise yet illuminating explanation of what is Bitcoin, what does it do and why it is superior to other crypto-currencies. What I like about this last part is that it tells you what blockchains can do, but more importantly what they can't do.",
    "This book was informative but read like an academic paper (written by an academic so that makes sense).\n\nThere’s some spicy bits and strongly worded opinions that were delightful however.\n\nI particularly enjoyed his assessment of financial history as it confirmed many of my own thoughts about how traditional economic policy is painted, which is just a lot of gas lighting.\n\nI came away a believer. I like a hard money not controlled by the gov. But I also came away not knowing how to buy and store bitcoin, without an application like coinbase, which now has to report to the government. This book was written pre-pandemic and probably pre-coinbase. So much has probably changed. But I read the whole thing through and came away without a website or email address where I could privately purchase bitcoin.\n\nAlso, bitcoin and the entire tech community has a disappointing, bordering on disgusting, lack of awareness about half of the species - women. It’s as if we literally do not exist. Which makes it just like all money on this planet - just more narcissistic patriarchy hoarding wealth for itself. Designed by, controlled by, utilized by, men who are having conversations that make no mention of, nor seek the insights of, women. So basically, not at all original. Utterly ordinary and completely missing out on the genius we have to offer.",
    "Although an initially interesting read, about the evolution of the monetary system it quickly becomes full of factual inaccuracies and over simplification of the monetary system as a whole. The book completely fails to mention the essential role of debt in the economy once. Instead this book pushes a dogmatic narrative argued by getting essential and easily to check facts COMPLETELY wrong. Also mentions very little about bitcoin.\n\nNever been so disappointed with a book.",
    "This book clearly explains why our current financial system will fail ...and soon. It proves that we’ve been duped for decades about how country’s economies are supposedly ‘managed’ by governments.\n\nIt reminds me of the way we were told that fat makes you fat and now we know it was actually sugar all along. The same is true of our economic theories. We’ve been sold a lie and our currencies are heading to zero.\n\nOur modern levels of debt and quantitative easing are now unsustainable so either we return to the gold standard or we move on.\n\nEnter Bitcoin. The hardest money ever.",
    "Look up the phrase \"hard money\" there I saved you reading this.\n\nRandian level Austrian economics, right wing market fundimentalism.\n\nAmmous has mixed up socialism and statism:\nSocialism is when the workers own the means of production. Not as stated in this book, the government. And socialism does not preclude market mechanisms as this book says it does.\n\nBetter sources of information are, 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism by Ha-Joon Chang. And the bitcoin white paper.",
    "I haven't even finished this book yet but I know that it's one of the best books I have ever read, and I read quite a lot of economics, bitcoin and finance. I usually don't leave comments on Amazon but felt like I want more people to read this. I am now surprised that I have never before come across a condensed book of economics that resonates so much with observations I have made about the financial and economic world of today.\n\nTruly an eye opening book, especially the first half of it. If you can even borrow it from a friend, I recommend you do.\n\nI got the audible version as well as paperback. Will sit nicely next to Mises in my library.\n\nThe book was first ordered by my friend to my address as he lives abroad and was planning to pick it up in a couple of weeks. I expected a slightly boring book with some propoganda, like Dr Julian Hosp's one, but I was pleasantly surprised to be very wrong. I ordered my own copy immediately.",
    "'The Bitcoin Standard' is an enjoyable, well-written account of the economic theory and history behind Bitcoin, particularly behind the idea of Bitcoin as 'digital gold'. Most of the book is devoted to a fairly detailed account of the history of money, as seen from Ammous's distinctively Austrian School point of view. Whether or not one agrees with this point of view, the historical account is vigorously and entertainingly argued; Ammous is not afraid to call out what he sees as the economic crimes of past and present, particularly with regards to fiat currency, socialist governments, and Keynesian central banking.\n\nAmmous argues that the gold standard was a far superior system to the fiat currency system we have today, and that the 'Bitcoin standard' will be its digital reincarnation. While this veneration of the gold standard may seem surprising or implausible to modern readers, Ammous argues his case well, citing the remarkable, indeed almost uninterrupted, economic boom that much of the West enjoyed during the years of the gold standard. This long period of prosperity under the gold standard is contrasted with the depressingly familiar 'boom and bust' cycle that has characterised the global economy since the abandonment of the gold standard in favour of the present system of 'fiat' currencies.\n\nHaving established his theoretical and historical case for why we need 'sound money', such as gold, Ammous spends the remainder of the book arguing why Bitcoin, and Bitcoin alone, is suited to perform the function of digital sound money. He argues that none of the alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) can fulfil this function, and that therefore Bitcoin itself should be the focus of any efforts to create a superior alternative to the current currency system. Finally he presents an idea for how Bitcoin could scale to the point of true worldwide use for the whole human population, namely a network of banks issuing currency backed by Bitcoin, thus the 'Bitcoin Standard' that gives the book its name.\n\nMy main quibble with the book is that Ammous only gives us a cursory explanation of how his long-term vision for Bitcoin as an international settlement currency would work. He states that Bitcoin's current transaction capacity of approximately 350,000 transactions per day would allow each bank in a network of 850 central banks to perform one final settlement transaction with every other bank in the network per day, and that if each of these banks served 10 million customers this would allow Bitcoin (or at least a central bank derived version of it) to be used by the world's entire population. Even putting aside the many significant problems that this approach would introduce, such as a return to (semi) trusted third parties and the possibility of these central banks running fractional reserve systems, Ammous never gives us any explanation of how this system would actually work, even in broad terms. For that reason I would rate this book 4.5 out of 5 stars if Amazon allowed such a rating.\n\nWith that aside, I would nonetheless very much recommend this book for anyone interested in the economic, monetary, and historical case for Bitcoin as 'digital gold'. If Ammous's predictions for the future of Bitcoin and the world monetary system come to pass then it will be not only a highly entertaining and interesting book but an important one too."

    " This book is an interesting read from the very start, Jordan opens the book talking about himself.. of course he would who else could do it better? If you were hoping for an introduction from someone else famous it isnt there.\n\nThe book is a mix of the history of Jordans back stories and a mix of his training. You will get all sorts of psychology and influence strategies mixed in the book. Some of these ideas and concepts are explained while some are not. This book is a condensed version of his live training.\n\nIts interesting that in the beginning of the book Jordan does apologize for his actions and reminds you the reader to do the right thing for the buyer your client.\n\nWhat you really need to know is anything in this book will take time for you to practice and master. There are quite a few concepts here. If I could give you one piece of advice and that is to start with the vocal pitch mastery because you can practice it anywhere whether on a sales call or talking to friends. That is chapter 4 in the book.\n\nI do have to let you know I have read piles of books on persuasion, influence, decision making, sales training, body language, NLP, question asking and even story telling and Jordan has done an amazing job of grabbing some of the best highlights from all of these topics.\n\nWhat I like about this book is it follows the video training Jordan uses. I would have to say that the book does a great job explaining the straight line system but this would be considered a diet version at 244 pages.\n\nHere is the rundown of the book mostly by chapter with my thoughts added.\n\nMost salespeople go down the path of looking for the special knowledge it takes to be a producer and close sales and there is plenty of this information you can implement in this book.\n\nOne of the early stories in the book Jordan explains is the first sales team complained that there were thousands of objections the buyers were giving them. In reality there were 14. In your industry there are probably 4 or 5. What it comes down to is salespeople like to make insurmountable excuses when they cant sell\n\nThe three tens is another way to explain the know like and trust formula. They like the product, they like you they have trust you will take care of them.\n\nThe buyer needs to be at an elevated belief or state in 3 areas in order to be influenced to make a buying decision. These 3 areas are based on a scale of 1-10 where one is they don’t care and 10 is they are on fire and need a solution now:\n1. They like the product, idea or the concept\n2. They trust and connect with you\n3. They buyer trust and connects with the company\n\nIf there is uncertainty in any of these areas you will get an automatic response of a common objection.\nLogical certainty vs emotional certainty is needed from the buyer to make a purchase and future pacing does help to get the buyer to a decision. Objections are a smoke screen to the three tens\n\nThe straight line name is explained and why it is important to the sales process. Once you are off the line you are out of bounds. A buyer is always trying to pull you off the line, they think it is their job. Its your job to keep them inside with the 3-10s. This is why salespeople need to stay on topic instead of trying to build so much rapport at the wrong time\n\nObjections are smoke screens for uncertainty, every bit of your presentation is built to help build certainty in the product or the service. This is goal oriented communication.\n\nWhat is not mentioned in the book – salespeople will only use what they have learned to the certainty that the training will work for them.\nThe 3-10 rules\n1. Take immediate control of the sale\n2. Engage in massive intelligence gathering while building rapport\n3. Make a smooth transition to the straight line to help build absolute certainty in the 3-10s\n\nMake your question gathering more invasive as the process goes along as trust has been built. Invasive questions early on may build resistance and doubt in your abilities.\n\nDrawing out a sales map does help salespeople see visually what is going on the sales process. Drawing a picture of what is going on sets the tone as laid out explaining the ideals of the straight line system.\n\nA pain threshold gets people to move away from it as it is human nature, once you uncover the pain you must have a good remedy to take care of it and then paint them a picture of the future to take care of it\n\nThe first 5 seconds\nWe as consumers make quick judgments, you as a salesperson better be at the top of your game at the entrance to the sales call or the phone call. You should be seen as\n1. Sharp as a tack – Goal oriented and the ability to do something for the buyer\n2. Enthusiastic as hell – Have a great upbeat energy about you\n3. An expert in your field - An expert that needs to be talked to, be an expert quickly and not a long term novice\n\nShow them you are worth listening to\n1. Get to the point quickly\n2. Do not waste the prospects time\n3. Have a solution to their problem\n4. Be a long term asset\n\nThe power of tonality (get the book just for this chapter)\nwe are conditioned as children to listen and we look for the verbal cues of someone who knows what they are doing whether we see this or not. Most people do not communicate well vocally and you have an opportunity to outpace salespeople that do not take this skill seriously.\nLeverage as many conditioned responses as possible so that it makes it easy for people to buy into what you have to say and what you have to offer. Let social norms do most of the heavy lifting for you in the sales process.\n\nState management\nFuture pacing + act as if is a crude way to describe this idea. You must master your state as an influencer to get people to make decisions and look at you like the expert in the room.\nWe are conditioned to look for experts and hear what they have to say from a young age.\nThe subject of NLP anchoring comes up and is explained. Two of the best people to teach this are Tom Vizzini and Kim McFarland. You can try to get the gist from the book but it is easier to learn from video just google their names. You cant learn this technique in 12 pages from a book as easy as you can from watching and listening to people.\n\nAdvanced tonality\nWhere Jordan truly masters the game of influencing people is the use of tonality. I have seen some of his recordings and have to say the book is good but does not do the teachings justice unless you can hear how he explains how to use your voice like a scalpel instead of a hammer. Thank goodness there is a link in the book you can use to find him explaining this concept to hear for yourself on page 116. You must practice how you use peoples name since it is one of their favorite things to hear. If you say their name like you are singing it you have a better chance of getting into their head. This works live just as it will over the phone. Interact with the buyer as if they were on a friend level vocally. The next step is to use “reason why” justification and explain what the “big idea” of the offer to the buyer to gain enough interest to keep them talking to you.\n\nAdvanced body language\nThere are some concepts in here about facial hair, dressing positioning and stances, jewelry, how to stand talking to a man to not create aggression, how to stand next to a woman to influence her, how to deal with other cultures and so many other non verbal topics that could cover an entire book. The concepts covered here are the highlights of what you need to know\n\nThe art of prospecting\nThe sell me this pen challenge in a job interview can be used as a metaphor for how many salespeople do not ask enough questions. Most salespeople go into feature and benefit mode before even knowing what the buyer needs.\nWhat it really comes down to is don’t sell things to people they don’t need\nLook for motivated buyers to sell them something they can use to fix a pain or a risk. There is a break down of how to tell if a buyer is not serious\n1. They ask a ton of questions\n2. They seem to drag out the process\n3. They pretend o be interested\n4. They wont talk about money and avoid answering the questions\n\nOverall this a good book for people who want to sell or persuade others better. This book is written in Jordans voice so you get the stories as well as his common catch phrases. Chapter 4 is worth the price of the book itself.",
    "Glad I decided to read this book..I enjoyed the movie the six times I watched it.\nI own my own magazine and aft several years I became complacent. Upon reading this book I was excited to get back in action and have implemented several ideas which have jumped started my business. I was actually excited to get back to work and was amazed how fun it is again",
    "This was an excellent book that teaches the Straight Line Sales Method in detail. I can attest that this system works. Every great salesman knows this system's art and science. A must have. Although Belfort had a sketchy past this is a huge contribution by him.",
    "Great read! Geared toward the salesman but can be worked into everyday life as well!!!",
    "It is mostly oriented on telephone sales. I think u should read it if you want to be better at sales. It can be read more than once.",
    "This straight line system intro experience have been awesome. You may grasp more of the tonalities by just purchasing the audible book along with this version. If you want to learn more, you must attend a seminar.",
    "Simple mantras of making sure that you stay in course to what you like to sell or believe in the service/product that you want people to have interest in. Could be reduced dramatically, but overall, good for anyone in sales that wants to know what are the key things that they need to focus on.",
    "My God! If you are in sales right now, you absolutely have to read this book. I ordered mine in March, and it was finally published and arrived yesterday. It took the day to read it, and was well worth the wait.\n\nBelfort has a deep and profound understanding of human nature and how to convey the right image to make a sale. From your tone of voice, cadence, enthusiasm, certainty, and belief in what you sell, he knows how to put that all together to generate sales at a rapid rate.\n\nOK, the book tells about his history selling stocks, training salespeople, and a little about the adventures he has had along the way. But\nmostly, for the price of a lunch, you are essentially getting the meat of the Straight Line Sales System that sells online for about $2,000 (at least that's what I remember a few years ago).\n\nOne caveat, this book tells the hard truth about making sales. If you sell arts and crafts at a bazaar..maybe this isn't for you. But if you sell high end products, that truly benefit those who buy, this is the book for you.\n\nIf you sell anything by phone, you can use about 100% of what's in this book. It will all apply to you. But if you are like me, and sell by appointment, maybe 90% will apply. But that 90% is pure gold.\n\nIf you are going to learn from someone, learn from the best. If your goal is to make money selling...learn from someone who made a fortune doing exactly that.\n\nOne thing you should know...Belfort talks about not using \"pressure\", but the techniques he teaches create an urgency to buy, and for some salespeople...that can be a little intimidating. Belfort's personality may turn a few off...you may not even particularly like him. And he swears. So if that hurts your ears, don't buy the book. But if you are hungry...and want to get ahead in selling....this book is the map.\n\nChapter 4 talks about tonality. And as another reviewer said, this chapter alone is well worth the cost of the book.\nIt's more than just the tone of voice...it's the cadence, amplitude, timing, certainty in the voice, \"caring\" in the voice...and more.\n\nBelfort teaches.how to transfer certainty to the prospect. And it's done mostly through how you speak (and body language and facial expressions in person), even more than what you say.\n\nWatch a great actor...a slight change in expression can carry loads of meaning. A shift in posture, a raised eyebrow, leaning forward slightly, lowering your voice slightly...can make a big difference. And it's that kind of thing Belfort is talking about.\n\nAnd it works powerfully. Belfort talks about tonality, because he sells over the phone.\n\nIt has been brought up that he sounds (in his sales videos) like a hustler.\nHis voice is annoying. There, I said it. And my guess is that most of his reps had less than a radio voice as well. And they were mostly uneducated young men.\n\nAnd that's one of the things that impressed me the most. Even though his voice is aggravating (to me)...he still sold millions of dollars of product a month. And he taught others how to do it as well. His methodology is that good.\nHis methodology is so well thought out, his understanding of human nature is so profound, his knowledge of the core of what makes people buy (or makes them object) is so deep... it overcomes all of his flaws (and ours) when pitching over the phone.\n\nAnd in his book he lays it all out. He is a gifted teacher, and it's impossible to not understand what he is teaching, and use it to your immediate profit.\nI'm going through my second reading now, with a yellow highlighter. This is the kind of book you study.",
    "I have just got to page 104 of this book and tbh I am disappointed, for some reason I expected more.\n\nThe books starts of fine then he rants on about NLP & sniffing BOOMBOOM, to take you back to your happy place, I’m reading this book thinking he must be deliberately taking the piss out of us.\n\nAs I say, I have got to page 104 and I am going to walk the dog before continuing to read BUT so far I can recommend many books to buy before this one.\n\nLet’s hope the second half is better than the first.\n\nUPDATE. Finished the book, the 2nd half does get slightly better and goes into more detail.\n\nAll in all, this 248 page book could have been a 50 page book maximum on the straight line system, the other pages are just dragging the whole thing out.\n\nAs a sales book, I wouldn’t recommend as an urgent read, add it to your list but it’s very much over egged.",
    "With no background in sales I wanted to learn how to get more customers to my business. I was recommended the book by a sales director I worked with and I found it to be very useful with lots of great techniques which are easy to understand and implement. I made a lot of notes which I am sure I will refer to many times in the future when I find myself in a selling situation.",
    "I was somewhat reserved in ourchasing this book... I didn't want to perpetuate the success of a questionable character and line his pockets via my credulous behaviour and desire to improve my sales game. But I couldnt hate this book. There are a few useful tips in here that you won't necessarily find in other sales books..\n\nOf course large parts of the book are nothing unconventionl. Tonality, body language, customer targetting etc. The first bit I found quite interesting was centered around NLP and olfactory state management where belfort suggests using a nasal spray called bang bang to give yourself a physical refresh and get yourself into the right state. It all sounds a bit out there but I do believe state management is important to sales and getting yourself in the right mindset and the right momement and on demand is a very powerful thing. I think this is actually decent and effective advice.\n\nThe main focus of the book is Jordans 'Straight line method' - which includes 'looping' and 'future pacing'. He assures you this is a bullet proof process where you will close anyone who is closable... hmmm.\nThere are some useful turns of phrase that can be extrapolated, and I like the idea of how he uses an objection to 'loop' back into the sale enabling you to continue with the process and focus on 'selling' another part of the product or service and increase certainty in an area he calls the 3 tens. (1) your product and service (2) your company (3) you. Aagain, inbetween the fluff there are a few things you can take and use but overall I found thes straight line method\na little difficult to digest.\n\nAgain this book has something to offer, but for me, doesnt come close to the utility of books like - SPIN selling, SNAP selling, New sales Simplified, Exactly how to sell , the Psychology of selling which i think all offer a more in depth and applicable approach to sales",
    "A bit of a mixed bag.\nA lot of self celebration from the author especially in the first half.\n\nStill fascinating to see how J Belfort thinks about sales. The method is an interesting take and a few things stuck in my mind as an example the low/high action threshold consideration is a nice addition to way of thinking about the sales situation.\n\nOne last thing Belfort seem to be in agreement with Tony Robbins on a number of things. It might be that NLP influenced both or that Belfort has been influenced by Tony directly. This might help people who know one author and are wondering if to read the other.",
    "WooW, incredible book. By far the best sales book I have ever. So, so simple to understand with easy to understand examples and very well written. Does not repeat its self and very useful with some diagrams in it as well. Just overall a very useful book about sales and persuasion. This book is not only a sales book but human communication and influence book."

    "Loved the book - great history of a bygone era. The spending habits of the Vanderbilts will amaze you. No wonder they ran out of money. Anderson Cooper is a great writer. I enjoy everything he has written since the storyline flows easily. Finished it in 2-3 days.",
    "Tells just what usually happens when the founder, leaves, and the next owner , just enjoying and not putting effort in to maintaining soon its in disaster.",
    "I will start by saying I usually don’t read non-fiction as it doesn’t comply with my main reason to read, but I had to read one to complete a requirement and this particular book attracted my attention.\nThat said, I was happy to read it. Though is not my type of reading and some parts were extremely tedious, I managed to learn quite a bit about this family, how the original fortune was made and dilapidated across the generations as well as the influence of some of these people, whether Vanderbilt or not, had on their particular time in history.\nTo others, the content of this book might be common knowledge, but I didn’t grow up here and my family is not the kind to have immersed themselves in the history of the places they’ve lived at so I don’t expect any of them to know what I learned from this book. The only fact I knew ahead of time was that Mr. Cooper was one of the sons of the late Gloria Vanderbilt.\nI particularly found the chapters about the 20th century Vanderbilts fascinating and it’s my opinion this family had their own soap opera going for generations. Why watch reruns of Dallas when you could just catch up on the family history?\nWhile some might not thing much of this book, I found it intriguing and learned quite a bit about the city I first walked around in my teen years while visiting with family.\n\n4 stars",

As an exercise is how the latest in this line has come to terms with this humungous legacy it is interesting if superficial.",
    "This writing team have produced the best, most interesting and most human of the books that I have read about the super-rich American families of the 19th century. Mr Cooper's family insight is invaluable. A must for anyone interested in this period.",
    "Interesting book about the Vanderbilt family, however sometimes a bit too long and i would be interested in understanding more the key factors of the increase of wealth and then decrease",

    "The greatest value of this book are the diversity of female voices writing on climate (diverse both in background and genre, varying between nonfiction prose and poetry, including one of my favorite poems, Marge Piercy's To Be of Use). My one regret is that I purchased this book on Kindle, rather than a print edition. As in any anthology, some entries will speak more strongly to a given reader than others. In this case, I think this is heightened because of both the political and tonal range of the essays: I feel certain almost everyone will find something that speaks deeply to them and something that bores or leaves them cold (not the same thing for any two readers). A print edition would be easier to jump around in. There are also some unexplained oddities in layout that may make more sense on the printed page.",
    "All We Can Save is a clarion call to action on behalf of our besieged Earth. It highlights numerous creative, insightful, and exciting examples of what is being done right now, though you likely have heard of none of them. GretaThunberg is right: the adults have failed the children and the planet--but not these adults. I scribbled notes like mad as I read story after story of amazing success all over the country.\n\nI stopped reading only to look around at my desert yard and begin to think of how I can transform it into more productive use, how I can amend the soil, find water in the dew. Specific examples throughout these 40+ stories are beyond inspiring: they bring reality to hope.\n\nRead this book, tell your friends about these undaunted women, and start walking the talk.\n\nTwo things:\n1. I read this book in the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg's death. And with each of these women, I thought that without the doors the amazing RBG opened, they could not be doing what they are.\n\n2. Fanstatic Fungi is an indie movie about mushrooms, and one of the most inspiring films you'll see for right now.\n\nHere's to the women in this book, to RBG, and to all the readers whose life will be changed by these stories. Most of all, here is to our Mother Earth.",
    "I loved the essay \"Black Gold\" by Leah Penniman, and I would give that particular essay the highest rating possible, as far as caliber of writing goes and substantive content. Overall, the entire book didn't sustain my interest level. To be honest, I'm not sure that Climate is an issue which is appropriately encapsulated within a book on feminism or through the eyes of women alone, and I found that to be both contrived and irritating in what I read. I am a man who has actually read and appreciated feminist authors like Sarah Grimké, Flora Tristán, etc., but I did not appreciate the angle of this book and found it overly simplistic. Climate is too all-encompassing of a topic. I also believe that it's important to present the indigenous narrative in better context. Most indigenous tribes did not have written forms of language, so to present European Colonization as an entirely genocidal episode of history is simply inaccurate. Colonization also brought some level of progress. Indigenous tribes also frequently warred against each other, and at the end of the day: all people are remarkably alike and similar, as well as equal. I think we need to be careful how we present some narratives, and the indigenous essayist's perspective seemed far too self-affirming. [PLEASE NOTE: I am an attorney who has actually worked in prosecuting genocide matters, so please no flippant and thoughtless remarks about my perspective being \"-phobic\" or embracing any racist ideologies, which I don't]. I thought the poetry that I read in this book was not worthy of publication, presented without context and lacked any real value. I didn't read most of the essays in this book, so there may have been other outstanding essays like Leah Penniman's work. I hope that she would respect that I didn't like the book, and as a gender non-conforming person myself: to write simply on women or to focus on women alone also leaves other groups out or simply gets dull and repetitive, which I found this book to be. I am a person who attends lectures on the loss of indigenous languages in my free time, so simply because I have a different opinion or one more balanced: does not mean that I don't appreciate the wisdom and value that indigenous cultures also had. Anyway, this is getting repetitive: but I like to end on a positive note. I really liked Leah Penniman's essay: it was wonderfully written, both educational and entertaining, and she presented on a topic which I hadn't really ever considered before: the relationship between African-Americans and the soil of the United States, and I found her essay to be fascinating. It also seemed informed, in the sense of presenting information with the right balance and accuracy. I also remember reading something about the connection of joy that contact with the soil brings people, and Leah wrote such a fine essay. I wanted to meet her after reading \"Black Gold\", which to me, is always the sign of a prolific and skilled writer. The other essayists and poets I have no interest in meeting.",
    "I enjoyed reading these pages. It is wonderful to see all the projects the authors (all women) are involved in to put the brakes on climate change. There is a good list at the end of the many organizations mentioned so you can look them up and choose which ones you want to support with your time and/or money.",
    "gives me a little bit of hope back",
    "I am looking forward to discussions related to All We Can Save in the coming months. I have been cherishing every bit of inspo I gain from reading the essays, enjoying the art, and joining the All We Can Save community. I particularly resonated with the Feel chapter...community mothering, finding joy in the work, choosing to SHOW UP, metabolizing new ideas, and making space in our own lives for a decent future. The contributors are EVERYTHING during this difficult time. I love how courageous they have been in their lives, and inspire others to be. Courage leads to action and we need so much more of it, especially with the added pressures and changes in our COVID times. I am all in! Amy Bartucci",
    "This is a lovely book - very informative and written by women with a wide array of experience. Reading through the lens of the authors' varied areas of expertise, is kind of like walking a 360° circle around the issue of climate change. You get a lot of new information. It's also refreshing to read a book by smart women! Yay!",
    "This book contains a wonderful collection of mostly well-written essays on our planetary crisis. However, if you are a while male with a passion for planetary wellness, you may want to skip the foreword presented by apparently anti-male feminist editors, which could dissuade you from reading the essays and learning many valuable lessons from inspirational female writers. Maybe the climate crisis is not gender neutral and maybe the dominant public voices on the climate crisis have been white men, but disparaging men, many of whom exhibit both masculine and feminine characteristics, may not promote a truly collaborate approach. Yes, the climate crisis is a leadership crisis, and certainly requires more characteristically feminine leadership but let’s make this a collaborate rather than a divisive aspiration.",
    "this book was truly lifechanging, especially our book circle that was brought alive through these pages! feeling very grateful for all these phenomenal women and their voices. thank you for this masterpiece!",
    "Looking at climate change from the ground up. People putting their heart into changing the way things are done to save what we can.",
    "I bought the book as a gift. She finds it excellent.",
    "A must read. My best ready of 2020."

    "I’ve been on the road for seven months travelling through Asia and Australia and as a digital nomad, excited about living a financially free lifestyle, it’s quite refreshing to read de Marco’s Fastlane Millionaire self help book.\n\nI like reading books like this one. First, the author is the kind of underdog expert I like. He’s not Tim Ferris, he doesn’t use fancy terms, I won’t be reading what the whole world is reading and my thinking isn’t interrupted with incessant exercises. Like Allen Carr for smoking or Steven Pressfield for writing , MJ de Marco builds a thorough, plain how-to-guide for apprentice businessmen. More often than not, every page has some sort of breakthrough point causing serious questioning or utter bewilderment. I say bewilderment because I believe that’s the necessary step to welcoming the understanding of a new perspective. I was baffled when I read the writer’s sharp but offensive opinion on slowlaners. After all, my parents and most of my friends are slowlaners.\n\nThe book compares three metaphoric paths to becoming a millionaire under the appellation of lanes. Put simply, you’re either on the sidewalk, the slowlane or the fastlane. I’ll leave the sidewalk section out of this review since leeches are hardly worth mentioning. Most people are part of the slowlane -- in other words the rat race – working the in the 9 to 5 model, repeating relentlessly the same daily effort to gain crumbs of extra wealth. The slowlaner is on the slow path to wealth – the 40 years path to retirement. The financial plan the slowlaner adopts encompasses saving 10% of their salary, living like a meager, investing into the stock exchange (and in compound-interest-yielding solutions) and praying that by the time he turns 65, inflation or a Ponzi scam hasn’t annihilated his savings…and then there’s the risk of a heart attack, cancer, etc. Even if he makes it, he’s too old to be pleased with it.\n\nI’ve got to say the first half of the book isn’t the most pleasant to read. Nor is it the most instructive for anybody with some reading pedigree. It’s repetitive and it strikes me as a bashing way to get the reader’s attention for the second part of the book. After all, what better way to sell the author’s fastlane to the reader in awe after reviewing all the downsides of the slowlane? The author’s style, quite abrupt at times, made me feel bitter and that’s not what I’m looking for in a book. De Marco is fastidious to say the very least and the read goes on and on. I’ve verified this aspect with a friend to who I suggested the book. We agreed, however, that once you got started on the fastlane part, the excruciatingly slow start to the book is all but forgotten and the serious learning can start. As the reading elapsed, it occurred to me that the first part of the book is a necessary mind stir to open it up to the newness of the fastlane.\n\nBesides, because the fear of leaving a comfortable but unchallenging job is so overwhelming and conflicting, something requires shredding that resistance.\n\nCrack the code to wealth\n\nDe Marco became a millionaire after building a multi-million internet-based business. He built it from scratch, after years of seeking an idea with a potential million at the end of it. Then, he persevered to be better than his competitors before selling it.\n\nThis is the right time to evoke the book’s subtitle, “Crack the code to wealth”, that de Marco uses to drive his point. When you’re in the slowlane, your potential for wealth increase is limited. You have a salary and can only expect so much from a raise. Assuming you don’t need to sleep, you’ll never be able to break the 24 hours threshold. In the fastlane however, your salary follows an uncontrolled unlimited leverage. The fact that the slowlane’s gains are limited by time contrasts with the fastlane’s exponential income leverage. Because the fastlaner can rely on an income factored by magnitude (how much you’re selling your product/service for) and by scale (the number of people you’re selling to) your gains are almost infinite. Numbers make the contrast more real, so here’s a numerical example inspired by the book:\n\nIf you’re making 10 bucks an hour and work fifty hours a week, you’re making 2000 bucks a month. Let’s say you get a 5% raise, you’ll make 2100 bucks a month. Your gain is linear and limited. Now let’s say you own an internet business that sells an web analytics tool you sell for 50 bucks a month to roughly 500 customers. Feeling confident with the competitiveness of your product, you increase your price to 75 bucks and with word of mouth making its way (and SEO improvements) on how good your product is, 1,000 people are now buying your product. Your monthly income has now inflated from 25,000 to 75,000 bucks; that’s a 300% raise.\n\nThis revealing contrast precedes a methodology and the outlines of a mindset to stick to the fastlane. It’s not going to be easy, says de Marco. The fastlane is not a Disneyland ride. No one is promising you you’ll make millions. Only you can take responsibility of that, through your choices. But with a focused process, designed toward success, the fastlaner can achieve in a few years what the slowlaner might only do in fourty.\n\nForget what you love, everybody is already doing that.\n\nIf one wants to build a successful business, it isn’t so much about what one loves to do. The fastlaner isn’t building something around his selfish need. It’s not about him.\n\nAt first, I found the injunction “Don’t do what you love” quite queer. Back in 2011, I read Marsha Sinetar’s “Do what you love, the money will follow” and it triggered an entrepreneurial thought process in me.\n\nWhat am I doing with my life? I could be doing what I love and I could be making some money.\n\nAs much as I needed to believe that at the time, it hasn’t worked. After almost a year of penniless efforts doing what I love, I’ll admit de Marco has a point.\n\nThe argument speaks for itself: the “do what you love” path is now so cluttered that the offer has swamped the supply side of the equation, reducing prices (magnitude) and commoditizing the whole field (denting the scale potential). I like that De Marco advocates designing a business focus on a need instead, not on one’s “selfish” interest – Why would anyone care enough to pay for your interests? One can approach it by paying attention to people’s complaints and seeking for problems to solve. The doing what you love part can come after you’ve cracked your code to wealth.\n\nBuild a process to produce something valuable\n\nNot only does de Marco refer to his experience as a business creator, he also uses testimonies from the fastlane forum where thousands of fastlaners discuss and support each other on a daily basis. The support of a community is required to build a process. Instead of dwelling on the event of success, the author stresses you can build a process to help you thrive: have a routine, delay gratification, find a community for support, learn, learn, and learn.\n\nIf you’re focused on events, you’ll be shifting projects constantly and running after every shiny object you’ll hear on the news or that someone’s told you about. In most cases, by the time the event has taken place, you’re already too late.\n\nSo, process gets results. De Marco suggests the process requires trial and error and it’s by repeating, repeating and repeating the same routine every day that you’ll produce something valuable. There’s something close to Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours of mastery in this .\n\nJust like the avant-gardist Aristotle said, “we are what we repeatedly do, excellence then is not an act, but a habit,” de Marco might argue that:\n\n“Excellence is not an event, but a process.”\n\nI’m still fine-tuning mine.\n\nWhat’s yours?",
    "I knew it wouldn’t give you guide steps to actually getting there. And if it did, it’d be a pyramid scheme or some other scam. It’s just a straight up mental attitude to internalize. I’ll probably reread over the years to keep it sharp.",
    "MJ's book is probably one of the best business books I have read in my entire life, and to be frank I rarely ever say that about most books I read.\n\nAfter reading MJ's book, I have probably already recommended it to 30+ of my closest entrepreneurial friends who also have felt the same about the book.\n\nAs an avid reader of many business books, it is hard to come by a book that truly cuts through all of the BS, and delivers time-tested and proven information from a been there done that no-nonsense entrepreneur who truly cares about your success.\n\nCompared to other authors who write books that just want to up-sell you into multi-thousand dollar training programs on the backend, this book stands in the face of all of that noise and \"flips them the bird.\"\n\nNot only does this book give you the mindset you must adopt if you want to be a successful entrepreneur, but even more so gives you the tools to use and implement to achieve massive success.\n\nI recommend that when implementing a new business idea, or enhancing your current business, please, please, please use this book as your guide.\n\nYou won't be sorry! By using this book to help you, you are definitely guaranteed to reach all of the goals you have set for yourself and your business...and I stand behind that statement 100% because it has already helped me tremendously with my mindset and business.\n\nHere is the truth...\n\nWhile most business books I read are \"good,\" very few of them are great.\n\nMJ's book falls into my \"great\" category for many reasons as described below!\n\nIn his book, not only do you get a glimpse into the mind of a been there done that multi-millionaire entrepreneur, who made his money OUTSIDE of the publishing business (unlike some of the most well-known business/financial guru's), but even more so, you get a to buy a book that you will want to keep on your night stand forever and be something you reference for many years to come.\n\nThe parts in the book that truly stuck out to me, and helped me gain a lot of insights and clarity for my business, life and financial plan were the specific parts highlighted below.\n\n1. Why Understanding The Process To Creating A Successful Business, is More Important Than Focusing on the One Time \"Wealth Event\" at The End...(The truth is that if you complete and stick to the process correctly, the wealth event at the end will be a result of all your hard work and discipline to not get ahead of yourself). (After reading this section I realized too many individuals are focusing on the wrong thing when they go into business. This mindset is definitely going to flip you for a loop and challenge every previous thought you ever had about accomplishing anything, and building a company for that matter)\n\n2. The Essential Elements To A Fastlane Business (And no they are not what you would expect...this part of the book is worth MILLIONS of dollars to you, and will help you eliminate TIME-WASTING wheel spinning activities in during your current and future entrepreneurial career)\n\n3. How to Make a Decision When Faced With Two Semi-Desirable Options (The logic in this is so sound, and the process can be duplicated over and over again, no matter what you are choosing between in the future)\n\n4. How To Truly Value Your Business and Set it Up To Be Sold For Millions (And no...it has nothing to do with how many \"users\" you have without any profit...get ready for this part of the book to blow you away)\n\n5. How To Create An Effective Exit Strategy For Your Business That Will Leave You Wealthy...Never Have To Worry About Money or What You Do With Your Time Ever Again (This mindset is so critical to grasp, as most of these web 2.0 companies exit strategy is \"sell to Google,\" when in reality that exit strategy is like praying to win the lottery without a sound base to stand on)\n\n6. How To Effectively Think About Investing The Money You Make After Selling Your Company For Millions to Ensure You Continually Grow Your Wealth and Income (If you thought you should be counting on the stock market to make you wealthy, this part of the book is going to shock you, but makes so much sense)\n\nSo without making the book sound any better than I already have, just listen to me and buy the book...you won't be sorry...just trust me.\n\nTruth be told...\n\nThe book was so good that I even bought it a second time on my new E-Reading device (nook), because I wanted to make sure I had it with me forever to reference if I ever lost my physical copy, or if one of my entrepreneurial friends secretly stole it from me without letting me know they were going to borrow it.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nIf I had to give a rating out of 5 stars for this book, I would give it a 10. You can't go wrong buying this book because the author truly cares about helping you create all of the entrepreneurial success your heart desires...\n\nHell, he even gives you his e-mail address to contact him after finishing the book! I don't know about you but that says a lot.\n\nEnjoy the book! You won't be sorry!\n\n-Scott\n\nP.S. I even interviewed him for my site here is the link to the interview enjoy!\n[...]",

    "Ich habe das Buch gekauft, weil es jemand auf einem Forum gelobt hat und behauptet hat, es sei ganz anders als alle anderen Selbsthilfebücher dieser Art. Nachdem ich das Buch gelesen habe, bin ich mir ziemlich sicher, dass dieser Forumsteilnehmer vom Autor bezahlt worden ist. Um es kurz zu fassen, dieses Buch ist genau wie jedes andere Buch dieser Art aufgebaut, ist extrem einfach gestrickt und enthält absolut keine nützlichen Informationen.\n\nWer glaubt, hier etwas über erfolgreiche Unternehmensführung zu lernen - oder auf nur, wie man Geld anlegt - kann das Buch getrost gleich wieder weglegen. Da findet man in jedem Buch zur Finanzmathematik oder Grundlagen der BWL mehr Gehalt.\n\nInhalt: Sie können auf dem Bürgersteig laufen (=Armut), auf der langsamen Spur fahren (=Standardjob, Zeit gegen wenig Geld, Mittelmaß) oder Sie können auf der Überholspur fahren (=Reichtum, Freiheit, zu tun, was Sie wollen). Um auf die Überholspur zu kommen, muss man bloß eine Geldquelle finden, die schön nach oben skaliert und große Mengen an Geld unabhängig von der aufgewendeten Arbeitszeit einbringt. Dafür muss man allerdings dann auch ein bisschen arbeiten, um die entsprechende tolle Geldquelle zu finden und aufzubauen. Das war's. Mehr ist an Inhalt in diesem Buch nicht zu finden.\n\nZur Schreibweise: Das Buch ist selbst für die im Englischen übliche Direktheit sehr schlicht gehalten, geradezu primitiv, und m.E. mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit von einem Ghostwriter geschrieben worden, oder zumindest hat der Autor übliche Selbsthilfebücher rezeptartig übertragen. Das sieht man klar am Aufbau. Es beginnt wie üblich mit langen autobiografischen Erläuterungen, was der Autor früher falsch gemacht hat und wie er dann, nachdem er's \"kapiert\" hat, reich geworden ist. Dann folgt Kapitel über Kapitel an Erklärungen, warum der Bürgersteig und die langsame Spur nicht so toll sind - was der Leser allerdings schon nach der ersten Seite verstanden hat, aber das Buch muss ja irgendwie gefüllt werden. Es folgen die ebenso langen Erklärungen, warum die Überholspur so fantastisch ist, und dabei wird nicht an weiterem absolut trivialem Rat gespart. So soll man zum Beispiel die X-Box mal zur Seite legen und an seinem Reichtum arbeiten, denn der kommt nicht von allein. Wer hätte das gedacht!\n\nWie schon gesagt, dieses Buch enthält absolut keine Information. In dieser Hinsicht ist es sogar schlechter als so manch anderes Selbsthilfebuch dieser Art, in dem sich vielleicht noch die eine oder andere Erklärung von Geldanlagemöglichkeiten findet. Solche Tipps lehnt dieser Autor kategorisch ab. Aber natürlich liegt das in Wirklichkeit wohl nur daran, dass sein Ghostwriter faul war und keine Lust hatte, im Internet zu recherchieren.\n\nFazit: Finger weg von diesem Buch! Kaufen Sie sich stattdessen lieber ein Buch über Statistik, Unternehmensführung und -Gründung, oder Finanzmathematik. Oder eine gute Autobiografie von jemandem, der im Leben wirklich erfolgreich war und nicht unter \"Survivor Bias\" leidet.",
    "I managed to get through 10%, I usually try to read 25%before I give up but on this occasion saw no point.\n\nFirstly,he keeps on going on and on and on and on about how bad the ‘get rich slow’ schemes are-cool but yet doesn’t not present his formula. Never in my life had I seen the words ‘get rich slow’ or any other words written so many times in such a short period of time. We get the point! What’s your solution???\n\nSecondly, he talks that the secret is in psychology and maths but in the 10% I read there is not even one mention of any psychological or mathematical terms.\n\nThirdly, he started or got rich in the late 90’s building websites-good for him but this is no longer applicable due to the tech advancement. Of course, the principle of success are timeless, so did he work hard and did long hours and hustle and made cold calls etc? Yes, he did. So why would this book be any different than any other book about success? Simply repeating the words ‘get rich slow is not the answer’ is not enough.\n\nVery little if any value and substance.\n\nGlad you can return it on Kindle and get money back.",
    "I downloaded this into my kindle library from a recommendation months ago and forgot all about it. While flipping through last week wondering what to read next I almost deleted it. I'm not big on get rich quick schemes but thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did. I may not be motivated by supercars, but I did finish this book feeling inspired and motivated and with a new perspective on my modest business. One of the best and most practical business books I've read.",
    "Reviewing this books is like writing another book titled \"A review for Millionair Fastlane\".I mean I liked the book and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to make millions, who have a dream, and want the world to be a better place 'A constantly upgrading world'.There are hundreds powerful lines throughout the book especially at the end pages.I would phrase one such line-\"As long as the world is imperfect, there is potential to make it better\"."

Mike’s list and mine exactly overlap. I have got to try the Mexican food in Santa Fe that he raves about.\n\nGet this book and keep it handy!",
    "What a relevant read! ￼1001 Fun Things to do in Retirement. My husband and I need encouragement, quite honestly, to do the fun things. We have a large family and could spend absolutely all the time that becomes available to us pursuing service to family, and with him, to church. But a well-balanced marriage benefits from cultivating the fun. Read it! No matter what time of life you’re in, it may give you ideas for purposing to have fun in your life with your spouse!￼￼",
    "This little book is a fast reading review of at least a 1000 things you can do to entertain yourself in you old age. The author encourages the reader to step out and enjoy the world around you. It is helpful that he lists those 1001 things that can jump start your adventures. He says it's not the destination it's the journey! I enjoyed this little book very much.",
    "Such a fun read. Can't decide what I want to do first: try my hand at flash fiction, take a train adventure, visit a national park or fill my craving for some of the food ideas. Recommend this for any retired person looking for ideas for a new experience. In fact, I think any age would find treasures in here. Already know I'll put it to good use when planning my next trip.",
    "Good gift for a coworker.",
    "Even if you already have a bucket list, this book will give you ideas for places to go and things to do that you may not have thought of or know about. It includes activities for outdoors people, art lovers, readers and more.",
    "I skimmed through it and I already like it. So I'm going to \"Buy It Again\" for me!",
    "I’m a planner and the information and ideas in Dr. Bellah’s book is treasure trove!! For me ….planning is almost as much fun as the trip…so this is the perfect book for figuring out all the details…and not just for travel but for adventures at home too!!! Highly recommend 👍",

    "I received this anonymous letter today:\n\nAttn: Book-of-the-Year 2018 Awards Committee\n\nDear John,\n\nAs you and your team gather in your plush executive offices (or perhaps at your gourmet dinner meeting) to discern your pick for the 2018 Book-of-the-Year Honors, please give this gem your serious consideration. I have 12 reasons why your readers would thank you profusely—should you name “Scaling Up” as your top book of 2018.\n\nIf you pick this book, you’ll have to write the summary (all that unnecessary filler stuff you write that goes on and on and on). I think readers of your book reviews, however, would prefer just getting to the good stuff, like these 12 reasons:\n\nReason #1. $20 AWARDS. Read about the Colorado company that required every manager—every month—to submit three ideas “for increasing revenue, reducing costs, or making something easier.” Managers who submitted the top 20 ideas—as determined by the CEO who responded to every idea submitted—received $20 cash per idea at the monthly managers meeting. (See page 166.)\n\nReason #2. BEST QUOTE. “Senior leaders know they have succeeded in building an organization that can scale—and is fun to run—when they are the dumbest people in the room! In turn, if they have all the answers (or act like they do), it guarantees organizational silence, exacerbates blindness (the CEO is always the last to know anyway), and means the senior team ends up carrying the entire load of the company on their backs.” (See page 5.)\n\nReason #3. THE WEEKLY MEETING. John, I know you’re a big fan of weekly meetings, but you never convinced me of the value of wasting everyone’s time weekly. But Verne Harnish, the brilliant author of “Scaling Up,” has totally convinced me! The “Rockefeller Habit #3: Meeting Rhythm” chapter gives amazing detail on four types of meetings: the daily huddle, the weekly meeting, the monthly management meeting, and the quarterly and annual planning meetings. I’ve become a born-again-meeting-rhythm-freak! (See pages 175-190—the most helpful 15 pages I’ve read all year.)\n\nReason #4. “EVERYTHING IS FINE!” As an example of the helpful detail on meetings, Harnish drops in frequent warning icons. “What’s the rock in your shoe?” is a high priority meeting agenda question for the daily huddle (Where are you stuck? What constraints are you facing in the next 24 hours?). And this wisdom/warning:\n\n“WARNING: Anytime somebody goes two days without reporting a constraint, you can bet there’s a problem lurking. Busy, productive people who are doing anything of consequence get stuck pretty regularly. The only people who don’t get stuck are those who aren’t doing anything or are so stuck that they don’t know it!! So, challenge the team member who reports, ‘Everything is fine!’” (See page 183.)\n\nReason #5. ROCKEFELLER HABITS. John, I’ve noticed that “Oh, my!” is one of your frequent and favorite filler phrases in your book reviews (could you dial that back a bit?). But, “Oh, my!”—am I the only leader or manager that has never heard of the Rockefeller Habits? I was blown away to learn about the leadership habits of John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) and to see how Verne Harnish’s consulting company, Gazelles, has systemized these 10 habits into a one-page, 40-item checklist. Brilliant! And read this warning from the author:\n\n“WARNING: You’ll drive everyone in the organization crazy if you implement all of these habits at one time. The key is focusing on one or two each quarter, giving everyone roughly 24 to 36 months to install these simple, yet powerful routines. Then it’s a process of continually refreshing them as the company scales up.” (See page 15 and read why habits are “routines that set you free!”)\n\nReason #6. THE QUESTION WE DO NOT KNOW. The graphics, icons, and format of this visually-appealing book are amazing (“Oh, my!” amazing, to be honest.) Like this call-out: “We have the answers, all the answers; it’s the question we do not know.” To help organizations achieve results, the author delivers detailed (detailed!) processes in four major areas: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. And—get this—he says it’s OK to start reading anywhere you want in the book. John, you owe me a Starbucks card if you can resist reading about weekly meetings first!\n\nReason #7. GUT-CHECK ZINGERS. Oh, my! These one-liners are convicting:\n• “NOTE: The cost of a bad hire is 15x his or her annual salary, according to Topgrading, so it’s important to get the recruiting and selection process right.”\n• “Good managers play checkers while great managers play chess, according to researchers Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman.”\n• “The bottleneck is always at the top of the bottle,” noted Peter Drucker.\n• “It’s time to break apart a 50-year-old business term—strategic planning—and think about it in terms of two distinct activities: strategic thinking and execution planning. Each requires two very different teams and processes.”\n\nReason #8. BIG, BUT NOT BIG ENOUGH. Read why you must conquer complexity. “Expanding from three to four people grows the team only 33%, yet complexity may increase 400%,” writes Harnish. He says optimal employee counts include: one to three; eight to 12; 40 to 70; 350 to 500; and 2,500 to 3,500. “Any company with an employee count between these natural clusters is likely feeling a bit stuck—“…‘big, but not big enough’ syndrome—even in making minor decisions like what size photocopy machines you need next.”\n\nReason #9. GARBAGE UNIVERSITY. John, you’ll love the insightful business stories—in-the-trenches examples—of how organizations are building the “Scaling Up” system into their DNA with training and education (normally about 2% to 3% of payroll).\n• The City Bin Company in Ireland created an internal learning academy, “Garbage University,” and provides “three hours of training every two weeks from September to May.” (Their CEO, by the way, never learned how to drive a garbage truck—and thinks the company is better for it!)\n• “At MOM’s Organic Market, in addition to executive education, produce managers will typically read four to five books together every year.”\n• Great companies start growing their people on day one. When they don’t, “…the first days on the job often feel more like waterboarding than onboarding: no desk, no computer, no phone…” (John, that reminds me of your 2017 book-of-the-year, “The Power of Moments.”)\n\nReason #10. RENAME “HR.” Verne Harnish mentions a company that “renamed its HR Department the Employee Experience Department.” Core values are not taken lightly in “Scaling Up.” He suggests you “organize your employee handbook into sections around each Core Value.” And—so insightful—“Every time you praise or reprimand someone, tie it back to a Core Value or Purpose.” Read his eight ways to reinforce culture on pages 102-106.\n\nYou’ll also appreciate his flexibility on terms: should we use “mission” or “purpose?” He says pick the term you prefer, but “use the terms consistently.” He likes “purpose” (more heartfelt). And to illustrate…here’s another “Oh, my!” You owe me another Starbucks card (or maybe Chick-fil-A), if you can read—without getting teary-eyed—about the company that asked how they could become more like Make-A-Wish Foundation for their employees—per their core value, “Take care of each other.” (See page 100.)\n\nReason #11. ONE-PAGE STRATEGIC PLAN. John, I realize I’m stepping on your strategic planning toes—but honestly—the “One-Page Strategic Plan (OPSP)” in “Scaling Up” is so, so good. And the detailed instructions for the downloadable 11” by 17” template give step-by-step directions. In preparation, Harnish suggests that managers work on the SWOT analysis, but senior teams should focus energies on SWT (Strengths, Weaknesses, and Trends). Example: “Forget about the competitor down the street. Is there a company on the other side of the globe that might put you out of business?” (See pages 123-140.)\n\nReason #12. SLOPPY EXECUTION. So (and with this I’ll end—and now I see why your reviews are so long: these books are powerful!)…what’s the downside of not reading this book? Harnish says if you don’t execute the Rockefeller Habits, “It just means you’ve been leaving massive amounts of money and time on the table. And if you have a killer strategy and/or heroic people willing to work 18-hour days, eight days a week, these will make up for the messes created by sloppy execution and lack of discipline.” (As you often say, John—“Yikes!”)\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAn Anonymous Reader\n\nP.S. John—Please give \"Scaling Up\" very serious consideration when you announce your Top-10 books of 2018 (and your book-of-the-year) on Dec. 31. (And please note I am not the author nor have I met the author!)",
    "What an amazing book for any business owner looking to expand and grow your business fast. I found this book while listening to a podcast and am extremely impressed at how much content is in each chapter. The noes into details in each chapter and breaks down what he is explaining into simple understandable terms. I will definitely reread this book in the future and recommend it to anyone who wants to scale up their business.",
    "As an investor I sit on the board of a number of companies and this book has given me an indispensable frameworks and ideas to define effective strategies and create change.\n\nAny business owner, investor or manager will benefit from reading this book. I would go so far to say as it’s the most valuable book I’ve read to help grow a business.\n\nThe book is structured in to three main section on people, strategy and cash. Included within each section are a number of printable resources for analysing your business and providing a framework to find the right people, set strategy and manage cash.\n\nHere’s what I took away from the book:\n• There are four main challenges to a business scaling up:\no Attracting and keeping the right People;\no Creating a truly differentiated Strategy;\no Driving flawless Execution; and\no Having plenty of Cash to weather the storms.\n\n• To scale up a business there are a few key priorities that should be set:\no Free up the senior management team from operational issues\no Refocus them on market facing activities and strategy setting\no Align the junior team to drive execution\n• A goal without a routine is a wish. A routine without a goal is aimless\n• There are three barriers to scaling up:\no Leadership\no Technology\no Cash\n\nPeople\n• Failing to construct the right team will drain energy from relationships and the business\n• Make a list of functions and processes in the organisation and allocate a name next to each. Set KPIs to hold each person to account\n• The most important KPI for the CEO is how many of their team is achieving their KPIs because this will prove that they have the right people doing the right things\n• Good leaders will exhibit two qualities: they don’t need to be managed and they consistently wow you with insights and output\n• To increase your chances of hiring successfully: create a job scorecard vs the usual job description) , aim for at least 20 CVs, use the threat of reference checks as truth serum\n\nStrategy\n• A well considered strategy based around mission, vision and values is hugely valuable\n• Use the 7 strata of strategy to help you come up with a strategy\n• Strategy should have clearly defined actions and be measurable through KPIs\n• Constantly review your strategy by gathering customer and employee feedback\n\nExecution\n• To execute the strategy follow the Rockefeller habits, track KPIs and instil a considered pattern of meetings (daily, monthly, quarterly) to track progress\n• Make sure that managers are in the habit of ‘closing the loop’ with customer and staff feedback",
    "This is an interesting book which looks at how you can push past the constraints which stop most businesses from growing.\n\nIt's split into four sections - people, strategy, execution and cash.\n\nI started reading it and throughout the People section, I was convinced this was going to be a five star book but, the more I read, the more I was tempted to knock off one star.\n\nThe book points to many other books as key resources and many of these will need to be read if you're going to be able to implement the outline ideas in this book. You're even sent to read articles by the author on the Internet. Little effort is made to summarise the key points of what there is to be gained. I read a lot of business books and this has encouraged me to add quite a few more to my library and others to my wishlist, which I'll consider getting if the topics become particularly relevant or if I see the books available cheaply. However as a standalone read, it's very frustrating.\n\nThe book points you at a website where you can download the forms to apply the system which is helpful if you don't mind form-filling. Personally I have a resistance to forms and an irritation that the space to desired contents ratio is normally wrong. I find it can inhibit creative thinking as you're reduced to box filling but it does help ensure completeness.\n\nI sometimes use forms in my business coaching with clients and I see the same problems where glib answers are given to fill in the boxes.\n\nDespite these comments, this is a very informative book and extremely useful for business owners and managers when the business has passed through the early stages of growth. I feel it's more suitable for businesses with thirty or forty employees or more rather than two or three employees.\n\nPaul Simister, a business coach who helps business owners who feel stuck, get unstuck.",
    " It’s been over a decade since Verne Harnish’s best-selling book Mastering the Rockefeller Habits was first released. Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It…and Why the Rest Don’t is the first major revision of the business classic.\n\nIn Scaling Up, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. This book is written so everyone — from frontline employees to senior executives — can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There’s no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth.\n\nThe goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into the wind at your back — creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing, and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, Scaling Up focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits Checklist™, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully — many to $1 billion and beyond.\n\nRunning a business is ultimately about freedom. Scaling Up shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride.",
    "A very good book but be careful if you are buying it as a small business. It is mostly applicable to businesses that are already very well established and turning over £5million plus.",
    "I was hoping for more stories, anecdotes and actual examples of companies scaling up, whether it worked or not, but this was more like an extended sales pitch with checklists, and endless buzzwords and random highlighting of importnat sounding words like *strategy* in bold to make it seem more insightful. TBH I gave up after a while. reading books about real scaling companies like amazon, netflix, airbnb etc has been much more helpful to me."

    "\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\" by Ariely Ariely (PI), was an interesting read, and deserves to be looked at by economist, psychologist, marketer, or just people looking to improve their selves alike. It follows the trend, set by Freakonomics, by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, in discussion of esoteric economic concepts, but without the academese that tends to keep casual readers away. I found myself personally engrossed while reading this novel due to the parallels of irrational behavior I discovered I also exhibited and will be actively correcting. The following three I believe have sentimental value to me and I feel are genuinely worth discussing.\n\nZero cost irrationality as described by PI is the concept that reviews the large bias humans show towards \"free.\" I put free in quotations as I am using the term loosely in this context as often the decision chosen is not without cost, and in relative terms, it is often not the option that held the most value per unit of the exchanging intermediary item. In fact, just a few hours before writing this brief review, I purchased three Publix cloth shopping bags that I had no intention of purchasing beforehand, but because they were buy three get one free. I can say in earnest, without that free offer, I would have completely shrugged off the Publix bag, to purchase at another time. A potential solution to this problem, derived from a specific example he mentions within the chapter, is to mentally give the \"free\" item a price, even one as low as one penny. This, surprisingly, nullifies the zero cost irrationality for most individuals, allowing for proper cost-benefit analysis of the additional item or offer.\n\nProcrastination, or the giving up of long-term goals for immediate gratification, this desire for immediate satisfaction permeates particularly strongly throughout American culture. The effect of this national procrastination can be seen by abhorrently low national saving rate, or more implicitly or healthcare system that is more reactive than proactive. Though I personally am not a pure procrastinator, in fact many would consider me an extrovert, I believe that there quite a bit I still put off that I do so exactly because I fail to properly evaluate the opportunity cost of the long term benefit of said action. For example, I did a quick back of an envelope calculation of me putting of my savings to next year, rather than not starting when I begun work two years ago. This three wait has cost me over half a million dollars (Assumptions: Roth IRA, with locked six percent APR, maturing in fifty years). I have begun taking Ariely's advice, and setting hard deadlines for many things, such as this particular book review which I gave myself exactly the day after completing the book to complete, no exceptions and no excuses.\n\nThe final personal irrationality I've found plaguing my decision making has been that of `keeping doors open,' or not being able to stand the idea of closing our alternative options. My irrational in my context, has to do with maybe not a plethora of options, as emphasized within the book, but rather when I am down to two options that have to deal with something within the social sphere. Case in point, I would fret over the decision of whether I should continue to chase after a girl or letting her go, or going to a party where I would probably feel uncomfortable or not, though these examples may seem simple to an someone else, I struggled with these decisions constantly. Often than not, I found myself unable to take the choice that errs on the side of negative (deciding to stay home, or leave the girl alone) as I felt doing so eliminates a multitude of options without producing any new ones of benefit. I am curious to whether how much confidence has to do with the exact experiment presented within the book. I speculate if participants were required to self select as confident, or perhaps anchored to think of confidence, if such decisions become easier. I wonder this, since many my such decision-making gridlocks underlie a lack of self confidence, perhaps those with more of it at the time of the test may change results. In sum, Ariely's solution, as I interpret it, the cure for procrastination is really premised by self-confidence, where one sets long term goals and bravely commits to them.\n\nThe book discussed around 14 irrationalities in total across 13 chapters, each holding a slight new scope of human cognizance to gain. The three above mentioned irrationalities after a deep introspective look, I felt held the most personal utility. I genuinely I have a new lens to the world. I genuinely believe that holds the potential to enrich the perspective of most readers as well, no matter their relative amount of academic background on the subject.",
    "Good book. I love this author. I now understand that the human mind is extremely irrational. Great read.",
    "A lot of common behaviors and phenomena are rationalized in a very understandable way. It has a lot of practical implications.",
    "I have not written any product reviews on Amazon, but I was forced into writing one because of my sincere admiration and new-found respect for Prof. Dan Ariely. I was introduced to the science of Behavioral Economics and the irrational decisions people make in their lives. The author, through his experiments, has an uncanny knack of explaining all the profound concepts in a simple and entertaining manner. The contents in this book will quite literally open your eyes and make you wonder how people are living in this so-called idealistic world of rational decision making. Some of the key ideas presented in this book are:\n\n-> How humans perceive value - \"not in absolute terms, but one with respect to another,\" and this is how companies and marketers deceive people with \"seemingly attractive\" offers that you cannot resist.\n-> Market forces of supply and demand only apply to rational people - in the real world, companies exploit people's irrationality and influence prices and demand.\n-> The power of FREE - People are, in essence, losing some other resource in trying to procure FREE items.\n-> The wonderful distinction of market and social norms, and why and how they cannot coexist. He also explains how companies can motivate their employees using social benefits, which are cheaper and stronger than financial incentives.\n-> As long as money is not involved, we are caring social animals.\n-> Why people exhibit different behaviors when they are \"normal\" (cold state) and when they are \"aroused\" (hot state). Learning to bridge the gap between the two extreme states is very important and will help you avoid making errors or bad decisions that you will forever regret.\n-> The high price of ownership reveals three irrational quirks in human behavior - we are deeply attached to what we have; we often focus on what we may lose (also called Loss Aversion); we assume other people (or buyers of our goods) to also value the goods in the same manner as we do.\n-> People's expectations can cloud their thinking, and they use this as a marketing strategy to influence their friends' tastes and preferences.\n-> Price is so powerful that it can drive the Placebo Effect - the more the price, the more the utility you derive from the product. This phenomenon was explained with Aspirin - why a 50 cent Aspirin can do what a penny Aspirin can't.\n-> Trust is an important public resource and a necessary lubricant of the economy. A few bad players in the market can completely erode it.\n-> Why even the most morally upright person can be susceptible to making small crimes that hardly matter. However, a contemplation of moral behavior or a religious code of law before doing any action can greatly reduce the likelihood of people committing these petty crimes.\n-> The idea of FREE LUNCHES in behavior economics; the science of economics should be modified to account for how people actually behave instead of how they should behave in society.\n\nThese are just some of the important principles explained in the book through experiments and startling revelations. It is easy to read and highly entertaining. However, there is one minor flaw in this book - the concepts and results described are all based on experiments performed on American college students or the western society, which may not be applicable to the more conservative societies in the world.\n\nBOTTOM LINE - Predictably Irrational is a wonderful book with new insights into irrational behavior in people. But for the one criticism, I believe this can change the way people think about economics, and can result in newer norms that account for our actual and not ideal behavior.\n\nPS: For people interested in reading more about behavior and cognitive sciences, I have the following book suggestions:\n1. \"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\" by Charles Duhigg.\n2. \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahnem.\n3. \"The Upside of Irrationality\" by Dan Ariely.\n4. \"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- but Some Don't\" by Nate Silver",
    "Predictably Irrational - Book review.\n\nGET THIS BOOK. That's it.\n\nA BRILLIANT read. Irrespective of what you do, you must read this textbook of human behaviour & how amazingly complex our minds are decisions are.\n\nA sample of what's inside:\n\nConsider an experiment on 100 students based on an old subscription model of The Economist magazine, offering:\n\nOption 1 - a web subscription for $59\n\nOption 2 - a print subscription for $125\n\nOption 3 - a web & print subscription for $125\n\n16 students chose Option 1\n\n0 students chose Option 2 (obvious!!)\n\n84 students chose Option 3.\n\nRevenue earned = $11,444.\n\nThe author then removed Option 2 (Print sub for $125) Results:\n\n68 students chose Option 1\n\n32 students went for Option 3Revenue earned = $8,012\n\nWhat could have possibly changed their minds? It was the mere presence of THE DECOY (2nd option) that made them buy MORE expensive options in the 1st experiment & less in the 2nd experiment.\n\nThe book is replete with such experiments. Also, real-life examples of human behaviour when it comes to product pricing (including 'anchoring'), buying houses, cheating, Starbucks Upsells, what Ford learned from Toyota about Car servicing and too many brilliant quotes.",
    "Classical economic theory is predicated on self-interested rational actors. But people aren’t rational. So much the worse for classical economics.\n\nAlthough people aren’t rational, they aren’t randomly irrational, either. Instead, they are predictably irrational, in a way that can be studied and measured, and be built into a more realistic economic theory: behavioural economics.\n\nDan Ariely, psychologist and behavioural economist, engagingly describes a range of experiments he and his colleagues has performed (mostly on undergraduate students, in the time-honoured experimental psychology manner) to unpick a wide range patterns of irrationality. He looks at the over-strong lure of free items, how we overvalue our possessions, how keeping options open can be a mistake, why shops will often display an expensive option they don’t expect to sell, why we are happy to do things for free we wouldn’t do if paid for, how more expensive items are more effective than identical cheaper ones, how dishonesty varies when cash is involved, how some people choose second best, and more.\n\nI found the chapter on free work versus paid work interesting, the difference being between social norms and market norms. The world is moving us towards the latter, seemingly to the detriment of enjoyment. Similarly the chapter on honesty highlights how people are more honest when cash is involved: while taking a pencil from work is barely noticed, taking the equivalent value in cash would be beyond the pale. Yet we are moving towards a cashless world, maybe to the detriment of honesty?\n\nThis is a good read, with the experiments clearly described, and the context and consequences well explained. I am not entirely convinced that the experimental situations, with their small values and low consequences, can be safely extrapolated to larger scale cases, but they are very illuminating. Several of the examples will be useful to help avoid faulty reasoning in certain cases. (Although I already order what I want from the menu, whether or not someone else in the party has previously ordered the same.)",
    "Woah, man! Just check out that picture on the cover. That's what the inside of your head will look like after reading this book! Well, pinker, and with more drippy bits, but you get the idea.\nNOTE: Please do not remove your head and look inside for comparative purposes.\nIn all seriousness, this book blew me away, by demonstrating aspects of human behaviour which is hard-wired into us. You will be shocked - I was - by just how easy we can be manipulated, and you'll be nodding along as you recognise all the times when you've fallen foul of these precise conditions. Even wondered why it takes you an hour to decide between brands of painkillers, when one is cheaper but the other is on special...? If you have, then man up and stick a plaster on it. But also, read this book, because it will tell you exactly why you find it so damn difficult to make that choice. It won't help you the next time you've got a pounding headache and Nurofen is half-off but still twice the price of ADSA's own bran paracetamol, but at least then you'll understand. And if your head explodes, and covers passers-by in pinky, drippy bits, try and have a look before you expire - I reckon it'll look just like this cover.",
    "MIT Professor Dan Ariely needs no introduction; he is one of the biggest names in the field of Behavioural Economics. Ariely studies the way we think, decide and operate – and in chapter after chapter he shows that we are far from being the rational creatures we think we are!\nIn one of the amazing studies in the book he shows for instance that the way we ‘frame’ something (p. 41) often determines how others are going to take it (remember Tom Sawyer and how he got his friends to paint that wall? For classroom management purposes, this is crucial; if we introduce activities saying ‘Now, this may hurt a little...’ chances are students are going to feel the pain!)\nThis leads to the hugely important subject – expectations: quick Q: would you like a beer with a drop of balsamic vinegar in it? (p. 159) A: It depends on whether you know it in advance or not! If you do, chances are you are going to dislike it. Expectations colour perceptions. How many times has this prejudiced us against certain students?\nAriely’s interests range from beverages to education. Here is another Q for you: which students have better results: those who are free to choose their own deadlines, or those where the professor ‘democratically’ decides for everyone? Incredibly, it is the latter! (p. 115) This finding may go against our cherished beliefs, but in fact it ties in very smoothly with notions of ‘ego depletion’ (Baumeister). The very process of deciding exhausts us, with the result that we are both more stressed and produce poorer-quality work.\nAriely writes in the simple, effortless and straightforward style that you find among people with a real command of their subject. Rather than bombarding the reader with studies and facts, he goes through each experiment in detail, ensuring that the reader manages to grasp the key concept in all its fine details. He then goes on to consider the possible applications of the findings in various fields of life – not just work. Yet what I like best about this book is that he also uses examples from his own life – sometimes funny, sometimes poignant.\nOK – now here is one last idea from the book: a little ‘conjuring trick’ for shamelessly manipulating students (pp 9 – 10): You give them a choice for homework: they can read a long article or they can write a short essay. But you really want them to write that essay. Piece of cake – you give them a third option; writing an even longer text! Now, nobody is going to choose that, right? Yes, but because the short essay is better than the long one, students also assume it’s preferable to the article too! Brilliant!! :-)",
    "This is an engagingly written introduction to behavioural economics. It is based largely on the author's own research, and so is laced with anecdotes about the behaviour of American students. If you are unfamiliar with the discipline, this is not a bad place to start. But it lacks the grand sweep and authoritativeness of Thinking Fast and Slow. It also assumes the reader is American, which can be annoying. And in my view, some of the policy proposals go beyond what is justified by the evidence presented in the chapters."

He also emphasis the essence of having a strategies that are easy to follow and track when setting out to meet corporate objectives.",
    "I usually start my reviews from the CONs, but there is little to be choosy about here.\n\nThe only drawback is there are not a lot of business lessons in the book. It's a great read, but I have only 11 highlights and notes. So, I didn't learn a lot.\nOh, and despite all the challenges, the whole story felt a bit lukewarm. Maybe Mr. Iger always calls every a**hole a \"strong personality\", or maybe he is just nice to the core? Well, it didn't feel very authentic.\nOn the other hand, maybe the life in the 0.01% earners in the world is so nice, how would I know?\n\nPROS\n1. Great Read.\n\"The Ride of a Lifetime\" reads amazingly well. I wolfed it.\nIt reads like a fast-paced thriller, but a one that actually happened and described from the first-person perspective.\nMy guess is Mr. Inger had a world-class ghostwriter ;) If not, then hats off to him; he would probably made more money as a writer than the CEO of Disney.\nI haven't enjoyed a book to this degree in a long time. I read it like I read the best fiction- almost in one sitting, and putting my whole life on hold to finish the book.\n\n2. A Sneak-Peek into the Billion-Dollar World.\nI've lived on this planet over 41 years and I haven't bumped yet into a person who earns billions of dollars, or the one who signs billion-dollar deals. This book was my next-to-best experience.\nI appreciate the author let me into his world and showed me around a bit. Steve Jobs, George Lucas... Now, I feel like I interacted with them.\n\n3. Business Lessons.\n\"The Ride of a Lifetime\" reads as a thriller, sprinkles some celebrity's names along the way, but it still is a business book.\nMy takeaways were few and far between, yet each time they were significant. Let's go over a few of them:\n\"Don't let your ego get in the way of making the best possible decisions.\"\nWe are emotional beings and most of emotions are related to our ego. It's enough to just take a step back and assess the situation to notice extraordinary solutions.\nIt applies as to life decisions as aptly as to business decisions.\n\n\"Long shots aren't usually as long as they seem.\"\nYou never know till you try. NEVER!\n\n\"What people think of you, they will think of your company.\"\nIt was the hurdle between Disney and Pixar in the first place. The two CEOs didn't think of themselves too high. So, there was no space for doing business. The shift of the relationship was possible only with the personal changes.\n\n\"Each deal depended on building trust with a single controlling entity.\"\nWell, in plain English: with a single person. Relationships are paramount in business. In fact, it's the 80% of the business. And the fabric of each relationship is always the mutual trust.\n\nAnd a couple of lessons from between the lines:\n1. \"Stay humble; be persistent.\"\nJust being humble and making decisions with a clear head would've been worthless without perseverance. The grit of Robert Inger demonstrated throughout his career is simply superb.\n\n2. \"Emotions, emotions, emotions.\"\nWhen the author described the biggest deals which build the power of Disney as it is now (Pixar, Marvel, LucasArts), he was all about navigating the emotions of the other man. There are some business considerations sprinkled over his narration, but the main thing was always considering the other person's emotions.\nLucasArts was the legacy for George Lucas. It couldn't be treat as a common business decision. Yes, Inger had to consider the financial aspect, but even the price Lucas obtained was the result of how much George identified with his universe than an effect of logical calculations.\nOnce Robert built a rapport with Steve, the deal between Pixar and Disney was almost seamless.\nEmotions are paramount, too.\n\nSummary\n\"The Ride of a Lifetime\" is a fascinating read AND you can learn something from it in the by-the-way manner.\nThe insight into the lives of the most powerful people in the world was an icing on the cake.\nDuring my lecture, I really liked the author as a person. Reading his story I appreciated how he found a balance between remaining a human being and becoming the top corpo official at the same time.",
    "No matter what role we have within an organization, Bob’s natural wisdom and business instincts teach us a way to move forward, inspire us to be more creative and give up “good enough” for something “great” instead. But above all, always keeping yourself true to your values and principles will help you overcome any challenge that may lay ahead. Excellent reading for all.",
    "The relationships Robert Iger made along his journey throughout his career are fascinating to read. There are many things to take from this book highly recommend reading it.",
    "My dad works in mergers and acquisitions so this book was super relevant. My dad said he loved it and even learned a thing or two even though he’s been working for 30 years. It’s a best seller for a reason and I can’t wait to read it myself.",
    "I bought this book because I wanted to learn from the best CEO and Disney has always fascinated me and I couldn't put it down. It was a page turner in it's own right! He seamlessly flowed through his history and I found myself thirsting for more as if I didn't know the ending or what was happening. I finished it in 2 days. I've learned a ton, but I'm just amazed at what he was able to accomplish! I was captivated the entire time. There were lots of lessons learned around problem-solving and leadership. He is quick with great intuition and great writer.",
    "A great read about the story of Bob Igor’s raid to the head of Disney. I loved it. I wish there were some more stories in there about more day to day work and decisions but it was still fascinating.",
    "The book is useful in that it tell the story of Disney from one man's (CEO) perspective. But if you've picked up this book hoping for some genuine insight on the corporate career ladder or doing well in business then you've picked the wrong book. Some useful business tips in there too.\n\nThe problem is this, corporate career type people are just like politicians. They never tell it straight. There's always some politics going on. There isn't a lot of boldness in this book. I would recommend a book written by an entrepreneur instead, they tend to be more bold and actually take a meaningful view on something (right or wrong).",
    "Disney has always had a huge impact on entertainment but the rise to dominance and timely pivots made this a book I was really looking forward to reading.\n\nIt was pointed out to me despite promising this wasn’t an autobiography it felt and read almost like one with its chronological approach but it lacked the personal depth to truly explain what was going on at various stages and the true emotions, perhaps because of the political ambitions touched on at the end something was held back.\n\nStories are often most fascinating as a journey and in true Disney style this book was no different, a seemingly broken animation company to arguably the dominant entertainment player is indeed a ride worth reading about.\n\nThere appeared to be far more lessons articulated in the early part of the story for me, the latter became far more of a narrative of various acquisitions which whilst interesting in terms of the negotiations and fulfilling a what seems sound strategy felt rather matter of fact.\n\nThe tine of disappointment on finishing reading this book is what leads be to only give it 4 out of 5 stars I would say but still a great read for the insight into strategy building, being gutsy and particular the way Bob came together successfully with Steve Jobs and the emotion attached to that retelling alone was the greatest value I took away.",
    "Such books dont come along very often. Robert Iger is a business legend after his performance as CEO of Disney and it was incredible reading about his rise from being a weatherman to the CEO of the largest entertainment company in the world. The book is insightful and theres a lot to learn from the experiences shared by Mr Iger. The only complain I would have from this book is that it was a little too brief at times and could have been more detailed. I felt under 300 pages did not do complete justice to his legendary career. Having said that, its still one of the best books ive read in a long time. A must read.",
    "The author takes us on a ride throughout his life. From his early career to the present. Through his eyes we can live the events that have him the experience that he holds today. In my early career on technology start ups, I find analysing his reflections very useful to guide my path. Thank you Bill Gates for suggesting this book in your insiders site.",
    "Stellar read even if you aren’t in the creative industry. The book is great for those looking to get inspired by a turnaround, as Bob Igor stepped in after years of things going poorly at Disney. Ride of a Lifetime has excellent stories on large corporate dealmaking with Disney acquiring Pixar, Lucas Films, Marvel and 21st Century Fox. Great read for business executives looking for insights on inorganic growth."

    "Author Vivek Ramaswamy wrote in the Introduction to this 2021 book, “As a young twenty-first century capitalist myself, the thing I was supposed to do was shut up and play along… applaud diversity and inclusion, and must on how to make the world a better place at conferences… The most important part of the trick was to stay mum about it. Now I’m violating the code by pulling back the curtain and showing you what’s really going on in corporate boardrooms across America. Why am I defecting? I’m fed up with corporate America’s game of pretending to care about justice in order to make money… It demands that a small group of investors and CEOs determine what’s good for society rather than our democracy at large. This new trend… [is] dividing our country to a breaking point… Wokeness has remade American capitalism in its own image… These days, white progressives have appropriated ‘stay woke’ as a general-purpose term that refers to being aware of all identity-based injustices… Being woke means waking up to these invisible power structures that govern the social universe… Basically, being woke means obsessing about race, gender, and sexual orientation… even though generations of civil rights leaders have taught us NOT to focus on race or gender. And now capitalism is trying to stay woke, too. Once corporations discovered wokeness, the inevitable happened: they used it to make money.” (Pg. 4-5)\n\nOf the January 6th riot, he comments, “When I watched it, I was ashamed of our nation. It made me want to be a better American. But I grew even more worried about what happened after the Capitol riot… Silicon Valley closed ranks to cancel the accounts of not only the people who participated in that riot but everyday conservatives across the country… It was a Soviet-style ideological purge… except the censorship czar wasn’t big government. It wasn’t private enterprise either. Rather it was … a frightening hybrid of the two.” (Pg. 8)\n\nHe states, “I believe even honest woke capitalists fail to see how much additional harm they do to American democracy when business elites tell ordinary Americans what causes they’re supposed to prioritize… So that’s my disagreement with sincere woke capitalists. But my bigger beef is with the INSINCERE woke capitalists. Here’s what the sincere guys miss: when they create a system in which business leaders decide moral questions, they open the floodgates for all their unscrupulous colleagues to abuse that newfound power.” (Pg. 29-30)\n\nHe says, “I’m not arguing that CEO’s or directors should be legally prohibited from using corporate resources to support their own pet social causes… I’m just saying CEOs and directors shouldn’t be protected by the BGR [business judgment rule] if a shareholder sues them for doing so. Why? Because using the corporate dime needed to fund your favorite social causes is no less a conflict of interest than a classical FINANCIAL conflict of interest.” (Pg. 98-99)\n\nHe asserts, “this new corporate practice of feigning wokeness INDIRECTLY wins favors in return from the government over the long run---favorable legislative treatment.. and other forms of corporate welfare. During Republican administrations, big companies used to gain political advantage by lending their alumni to occupy powerful government positions… Now corporations have simply come up with a new trick tailored for a Democrats: they lend corporate power as a tool to implement radical agendas that Democrats could never pass in Congress.” (Pg. 121-122)\n\nHe summarizes, “Wokeness and capitalism simply tolerate each other because each feels it can use the other. They will turn a blind eye to each other’s faults as long as they themselves can still benefit. But a marriage in which each side secretly has contempt for the other cannot end well.” (Pg. 140)\nHe notes, “It sounds great to some people when woke capitalists support causes they like, like BLM… foreign authoritarian nations … ruthlessly leverage their stakeholder status to selectively determine which causes woke capitalists throw their weight behind. The NBA can put ‘Black Lives Matter’ on all its courts because the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] isn’t threatened by the message. But the Communist Party would never allow the NBA… to breathe a word in support of Hong Kong, Taiwan, or the Uighurs…” (Pg. 168)\n\nHe argues, “this broad wave of deplatforming didn’t just happen to prominent politicians… It happened to ordinary Americans too… Well, doesn’t the free market provide a solution? It did… in the form or Parler, a Twitter alternative popular with conservatives… Ultimately, it paid a hefty price… Following the Capitol riot, Parler was blocked from being downloaded from Google’s Play Store, was suspended from Apple’s App Store, and lost access to Amazon Web Services… This isn’t about silencing conservatives. That’s just how they get you on board with the idea of censorship… whatever speech powerful interests dislike becomes hate speech.” (Pg. 199-200)\n\nHe observes, “opposing the Black Lives Matter movement… in the Church of Diversity… makes one automatically anti-black… The Church of Diversity … has decided to begin punishing all the nonbelievers. A democracy nay thrive on dissent, but a theocracy can’t tolerate it.” (Pg. 222-223) He continues, “wokeness is the new orthodoxy, the new religion, one that disguises itself in secular clothing. Because its disciples worship the secular force of identity rather than any supernatural one, it’s much easier for the Church of Diversity to infiltrate the workplace.” (Pg. 231) Later, he adds,\n“it's evident that wokeness plays a religious role on one’s life, and therefore is really a religion… Under the woke worldview, being born white, straight, make, or… all three is an original sin that one must spend their life atoning for.” (Pg. 257)\n\nHe explains, “I propose a new movement to resist the enforcement or race- and gender diversity, in response to intellectual movements such as critical race theory and critical feminist theory, which spawned this narrow conception of diversity… This new movement aims to more effectively achieve three essential objectives: (1) define what types of diversity of thought are important to an organization, (2) measure diversity of thought in an organization, and (3) select for diversity of thought when hiring leaders to scale an organization. I call this ‘critical diversity theory.’” (Pg. 267)\n\nHe asserts, “it’s no surprise that those kids later grow up to be woke capitalists. It’s rooted in a guilt complex for never genuinely having helped other people… they try to mix up their profit-oriented pursuits with making up for their past… That’s what woke capitalism is all about: companies performatively one-upping each other to show that they’re the good guys, and consumers are falling for their tricks.” (Pg. 309)\n\nHe concludes, “In the end, American isn’t a place at all. It’s an idea. We call it the American DREAM for a reason. It’s not a destination that we reach; it’s a vision we aspire to… But over the last decade, something scary happened: WE WOKE UP. And once you wake up from a dream, you forget what it was all about. That’s the real danger of wokeness.” (Pg. 327)\n\nThis will interest readers seeking critiques of the so-called ‘woke’ movement among progressives.",
    "Mr. Ramaswamy gets to the heart of the most problematic issue America faces today. While many of us inherently understand this problem with extreme \"wokeness\" already, as it relates to its adoption by and influence on corporations, he constructs points, deconstructs fallacies, and articulates his thoughts and understanding of this issue with such skill and clarity, I could almost feel another set of scales fall from my eyes while reading it.\n\nMaterial is kind of heavy, but an easier read than I expected. I haven't felt this way about a book since reading \"Bias\" over 20 years ago.",
    "Great book and insight into the capitalist agenda into social movements.",
    "The author is an accomplished human being both in academia and in business. He is Hindu and Indian which provides him a platform that sees America more objectively. Worth the read. We’ll written.",
    "Exposes the motivations of corporations that deceptively promote woke initiatives. The argument is supported with real life examples.",
    "Written by the son of Indian immigrants, Woke, Inc., is a fascinating story of Vivek Ramaswamy’s journey through two of the top universities in the country, to some of the biggest corporations and eventually founding his own biotech company. He has extraordinary insight into how big business is using “Woke” politics to their advantage. Businesses in the U.S. think that they can grow a following, and in the process, increase their bottom line by pretending to be something they are not.\n\nRamaswamy draws a contrast between shareholder capitalism and the new stakeholder capitalism that seems to be the latest fad among many of the largest corporations. As these corporations put their money and time into social justice pursuits, they are robbing the shareholders of what has traditionally been the reason that individuals invest their money in these businesses.\n\nThe result of this move toward things that have nothing to do with making money and growing their business is a loss of the main purpose for existing. He makes the case that it is capitalism that has made the U.S. the most prosperous nation in history. The move away from shareholder capitalism will, in the end, hurt the economy and hurt business.\n\nBehind closed doors these business tycoons are laughing at how gullible people are to think they really care about these causes. They are using emotion and people’s desire to do good only to improve their image. As they shift their ideology away from business to social causes, they divide the country and hurt our image as Americans.\n\nRamasamy tells us his story of enlightenment in a most engaging way. In so doing he gives us hope that the American dream of success and personal accomplishment is still possible. The belief in an individual being able to take an idea and create something new is an American idea that will remain our hallmark. I highly recommend Woke, Inc. for all business leaders as well as investors and entrepreneurs.",
    "I purchased the book for my husband and he read it in two days. It is a good read.",
    "The mainstream media delivery a daily stream of articles why \"being woke\" is good.\n\nThis book takes a more critical stance, and addresses issues that much of the mainstream media is unwilling or unable to address.\n\nIf you are looking to get a complete overview of the subject of \"wokeneomics\", this is THE book you need to read.\n\nI give it five stars both for its content and the author's willingness to take flak for addressing inconvenient truths.",
    "This book is written by a former Pharmaceutical CEO and first generation immigrant to the USA. It is written in a very engaging and approachable style yet it is a forensic (fully referenced) critique of the way in which the woke 'religion' is fundamentally undermining all the safeguards the founding fathers put into the US Constitution to protect the people from overbearing malign influence. Importantly it also proposes very straight forward ways in which existing laws could be used to redress the balance. Highly recommended.",
    "I knew corporations were hypocrites and greedy but this book gives examples of how planned and deliberate it is. And how stupid it is for society.",
    "My headline sums up my feelings really. It’s as though the author got no input whatsoever from a professional editor. This really detracts from the message which is a real shame because his message needs to be heard. The author and I are definitely not in the same quadrant of the political compass. He comes across as a socially conservative. I have however grown increasingly queasy at corporate wokeness and Big Tech’s social & political power. The author has given me words to articulate this better…just way too many words.",
    "I was interested in this book because working for large US corporations exposed me to a huge amount of DEI etc training and discussion - much of which was at best boring and often patronising. This book does make some interesting points but progressively becomes more and more extreme (from a UK perspective) as it comes from an ultra conservative right wing perspective. Interesting to read literature coming from this perspective for a change - but some real poison."

    "I really wanted to like this book. I've never read or heard anything previously from Thiel, so I had little bias going in. I heard a recent radio interview with Peter Thiel where I thought he handled questions really well and gave some great advice for entrepreneurs. From the amount of 5 star reviews on Amazon and an online list I found of best business books of all time with this book on it, I was expecting something very profound. I guess you could say no amount of Peter Thiel's novel insights and experiential knowledge could have met my high expectations. However, I was going to give the book 4 stars until I hit about half-way through book, where it just all seemed to go downhill thereafter. I suddenly started questioning many of Thiel's assertions from the earlier chapters, and ended up with a lopsided Pros vs. Cons list. I started researching into Thiel's accomplishment's and failures. The result was a three star review. My opinions are outlined below.\n\nI'll start with what I liked:\n\n1.) The book has a core theme of empowering the individual. The technological future is not going to happen unless individuals or teams thereof make it happen. The future is not inevitable. Moore's law for transistors just doesn't happen like a natural phenomena; you need a dedicated team of innovators always solving the technical challenges. (Actually, Moore's law is expected to not hold over the next decade, due to technological barriers.) I liked the idea of \"You are not a lottery ticket.\" Too much credit is given to founder blind luck in the creation of successful companies in popular culture. There were a whole lot of people busting their humps with late nights and weekends making these things happen. Startups are not 9-5 M-F jobs with lots of vacation and perks built in.\n\n2.) Thiel reminds engineers that while their work is essential at a startup, its not sufficient for a successful business venture. You have to get your product to the customer (i.e. figure out the manufacturing/supply chains/logistics). You have to explain how this product is going to benefit the customer. You have to convince a customer to part from his/her money. This doesn't just magically happen, you're going to have to be a hustler if you ever want to see real profits.\n\n3.) Although sometimes obvious, the book is full of useful advice and anecdotal lessons learned from tech startups' failures and successes. If you are planning a startup or interested in joining one you should read this book. You will learn something about entrepreneurship.\n\nHere's what I didn't like:\n\n1.) Absence of Supporting Evidence. The writing style is very informal, which I actually enjoy (makes for a quick read), but many of his arguments are made poorly (sometimes unconvincingly). There are no citations in this book. No references are mentioned. Subjective opinions and personal anecdotes often substitute for any factual evidence. It's pretty clear Thiel has a disdain for statistics of any kind, both in a factual statistic sense and for any technology that relies on stochastic techniques. The book is also chock full of superlatives and (mostly false) dichotomies. A prime example: \"Almost all successful entrepreneurs are simultaneously insiders and outsiders....When you plot them out, founders' traits appear to follow an inverse normal distribution.\" No citation or reference given....yeesh....I mean is this a personality study Peter Thiel personally did or does he just completely make this up? Another example is his central theme: \"All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.\" Not really true of either sentence as counter examples are given even by Thiel later in the book (e.g. some companies implode by poor distribution, infighting, unprofitable ideas, etc.) I'm glad Thiel didn't become a trial lawyer, he'd get embarrassed in any court room. Ironically, the book makes Thiel come across as sounding like the ivory tower university professor he so loathes, with all the 'take my word for it', 'I'm the expert'superficial arguments he makes in the book.\n\n2.) Poor definitions and arbitrary/contradictory arguments. It's not real clear what's an incremental advance and what's not. A 10x improvement is not technically feasible or theoretically possible in many fields. For example, a power plant operating at 30% energy efficiency can't have a 10x advance in energy efficiency (more than 100 % efficiency breaks the conservation of energy law). Sometimes just a 2X (100%) advance is a big freaking deal. Doubling the fuel economy on a car (without negatively affecting its performance, safety, or cost) is a really hard problem that, if solved would be a huge breakthrough. It would line customers up at your door. Even Tesla, the company Thiel has a major hard-on for in the Seeing Green chapter, hasn't achieved that: a new Tesla roadster set you back at least $110,000 US, their lower end vehicles are still North of $60,000 US even with generous government subsidies and incentives. Not exactly a common man's car anyone can afford.\n\nAlso, the claim of \"undifferentiated products\" is kind of a straw man argument. Do any two companies really produce identical products? Yes Pepsi and Coca-cola both make similar soft drinks, but they are not identical. Some people like the taste of Coke, others prefer the taste of Pepsi, but they don't taste the same. Big Macs vs. Whoppers. One make/model of vehicles vs. others. One Airline carrier over others. Most people will prefer one over the other, even if just by a little, and even if the prices are different (within a reasonable range). That's why businesses still exist in competitive markets. If this wasn't true, the lowest price, even by a penny, wins by default and monopolies would happen naturally in the long run, without need for any further competition.\n\nHis last chapter on stagnation or singularity is very nebulous in which he plots \"progress\" on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal. It's not really clear why he chose just four scenarios? Why not linear progress? Why not linear with a mix of boom/bust cycles? The possibilities/combinations are endless. What does he mean by progress anyway? Computing power? World GDP? The DJI or NASDAQ Index? Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n3.) Patently Obvious. Some statements that Thiel writes is blatantly obvious: see Elkin Wells \"Ok, not amazing.\" review for great examples. The irony of this book is that it does not really represent a Zero to One contribution to thinking in technology, entrepreneurship, business, futurism, philosophy, etc. What Thiel states in this book has been said by many other people for quite some time. His central tenet of \"creative\" monopolies (i.e. a monopoly achieved through secured patents, copyrights, trade secrets, etc.) are a good thing that all startups should strive to achieve, wouldn't surprise anyone who has taken a basic economics or business class or has tried to start a business. I mean who starts a business (excluding franchises) and thinks I'm going to get rich producing exactly the same product this other guy did at the same cost. Everyone thinks their business is unique in some way. On the novelty factor, the US Patent & Trademark Office states it's mission is (it's also in the Constitution) \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writing and discoveries.\" This is pretty obvious stuff, if you have nothing to gain personally by inventing something and sharing it with the world, you probably won't. And we all lose out in that scenario. Thus, a creative monopoly is something to be encouraged. The other key concept here is that these are temporary monopolies on specific products/works (e.g. a utility patent has a expiration of 20 years after filing). Creative monopolies don't last forever. A company has to keep innovating in order to obtain more creative monopolies for different products or refined products. To be fair, I think Thiel was trying to say this about Google and Apple, but he didn't finish the thought.\n\n4.) Started Strong, ended very weakly. The first few chapters were pretty balanced and thought-provoking. The later chapters on green technology, characteristics of founders, and a brief comment on what the future may look like were a collection of half-baked and half-hearted ideas. The Founders Paradox chapter was an embarrassingly bad mix of pop culture nonsense that compares tech founders to rock stars and Gods (I'm not kidding or exaggerating). The book has \"How to Build the Future\" in its title and all we get from Thiel's final chapter is what he thinks the future may look like in a five page conjecture about what shape the progress over time graph may look like. Thoroughly disappointing.\n\n5.) The organization of the book is pretty haphazard as well. It jumps from discussions of monopolies and competition and recommendations/pitfalls to avoid for a successful startup (which fit the title of the book) to a poorly argued discussion about founder traits and green technology.\n\n6.) Silicon Valley is the center of the Universe? Thiel constantly references Silicon Valley companies and culture ad nauseam. Google this and Apple that. Hoodies, Crocs, and T-shirts are the coolest.....Yes I know it is the IT Mecca and it's where every programmer wants to land a job, but there is a whole startup world outside of the Valley. HBO's Silicon Valley show highlights some of the absurdities within the Valley's tech culture. Silicon Valley tends to suffer from a lot of superiority complexes, group think, and trend chasing as a result of both its real and perceived successes.\n\n7.) Peter Thiel can do no wrong, or he can see the future and you can't. Thiel has made a name for himself by claiming to be a \"contrarian thinker\" and for his financial successes at PayPal, Google, and Facebook. He also likes to point out indefinitely optimistic the financial world is (page 70) as if he somehow knows how to beat the market. However, his hedge fund took a beating just like all the rest of the others during the 2008 crash. He doesn't discuss any of his failed VC endeavors at all in the book. Would be nice to hear what mistakes you've learned from personally. Or maybe every investment Thiel's made has gone gangbusters? Doubtful. Never mentions the highly publicized failure of his Thiel fellowship where he paid $100K to 20 college students to drop out of college and start a business.\n\nOn page 75 he puts up a table of the differences between software and biotech companies (a real apples to oranges comparison, as evidenced by the table's stark contrast of biotech's study of expensive \"poorly understood\", \"uncontrollable organisms\" and software's artificially created, well understood, cheap environment.) He then makes the statement, \"It's possible to wonder whether the genuine difficulty of biology has become an excuse for biotech startups' indefinite approach to research in general.\" Actually, Thiel I think the extreme contrast of lack of knowledge and understanding in a natural complex system like biology versus an artificial system like software (which he just highlighted) is the reason for the indefinite approach. Also Thiel seems to have a disdain for biotech (my guess is he has been burned by the slow pace of biological research on several investments in biotech) without a respect for its inherent complexity versus the highly linear and artificial world of computing. Yes, designing the software for PayPal's digital transactions is not trivial, but it pales in comparison to the difficulty of eradicating every ~100nm cancer cell in a human without killing the host. The number of variables (if they are even known in the biotech example) to account for are orders of magnitude larger than any problem a programmer would face. Re-iteration speed in computing is taken for granted as well. What's the worse that happens if your code has errors? It won't even break the machine it runs on unless that's your intent. We all know what the worse case is in biotech/medicine. He also acts like no innovation has come from biotech in the past 3 or 4 decades. What about the human genome mapping? What about artificial hearts and kidneys? Artificial hips and knees? Genetically modified plants that have 10x better yields? DNA matching of criminals from trace amounts of tissue samples that has revolutionized the justice system?\n\nHe also didn't see the Green Tech bubble coming? In the seeing green chapter he rails against solar companies for seeking only incremental advances in technology as their major downfall. Yet he fails to see the real technological challenges of solar and wind: they are location specific and their energy density (the amount of energy you get from the same stored volume or weight of the fuel) is nowhere near that of nuclear and non-renewables. That is a huge pitfall to overcome in the energy and transportation sector and it's always been the well-known reason why wind and solar are niche power applications. At a coal or nuclear power plant, if the energy demand from a nearby city goes up, you just burn more fuel and possibly start up another turbine. The amount of fuel you have is only limited by logistics and your onsite storage. Not only are onsite storage needs larger for a solar or wind farm (a battery has much lower energy density than a lump of coal/ fuel rod/gallon of gasoline of the same weight) but your fuel (essentially electrons for storage) is generated onsite. Both wind and solar need enormously large areas of generation equipment (panels or turbines) to generate any appreciable energy for even a small city. And the ideal location for solar and wind power plants are often in deserts or on mountain sides, or miles off the coastline: exactly where most people don't live. So any efficiency gains you get from putting it in an ideal location is lost to power line transmission by having to put it far away from people using the power. The poor energy density is an even bigger problem with electric vehicles. These are multiple engineering feats that need major improvement, not simply a 10x reduction in a single technology. Nevertheless, modest efficiency gains of even a few percent in the energy sector are technically challenging or costly or both; thermal efficiency of conventional power plants have gone up only ~10-15% in the past century. There are fundamental limits to thermodynamics.\n\nIn the end, Thiel is susceptible to the same dogmas (\"peak oil\", Malthusian resource shortages, the inevitability of \"green\" technology, reduce carbon emissions at all costs) that anyone else could end up believing without questioning any assumptions. Thiel shows a glaring ignorance of technology outside of IT. When technical progress doesn't meet the accelerated pace that he's seen in the computing world, he resorts to shooting the messenger and blaming the researchers within the field.\n\n9.) If all the negatives above sounds like a class you've taken in college. That's because that's exactly how this book started. Thiel taught a class at Standford about startups with the same material. In fairness, Thiel's audience for the lectures that inspired the book, freshman and sophomores in Stanford's Computer Science department, probably know as much about business and economics as Thiel knows about being humble about his success at PayPal, hence the lack of any real depth on any particular subject matter. However, this is not forgivable when the notes from a class are almost pasted into a hardcover book verbatim. I mean there was a chance for some serious editing, more depth and refinement, and re-organization during this conversion process, but it doesn't appear much thought went into any of these. Honestly I thought the notes were better (which has more chapters as well), because they included many more pictures with better humor and more detail. My guess is that Thiel probably gave outstanding lectures with some cool Powerpoint slides, but any charisma and charm from the lectures were lost during the book transition.\n\nQualifiers and Disclaimers: I'm a bioengineer doing both hardware and software for a small biotech startup. I was a patent examiner (in semiconductors) for the USPTO and still do part-time contract work for them (in mechanical and medical devices) so I see innovation all the time. I also consider myself a libertarian politically, as does Peter Thiel. Read some of the other 3 star reviews of this book, they are very much on point.",
    "In 2012 venture capitalist Peter Thiel taught a course in his alma matter Stanford about startup, entrepreneurship, and business in general. And among his many students, one in particular, Blake Masters, took very detailed and diligent notes where it then being copied, shared, and became wildly popular among the students.\n\nThis book is the polished edition of that concise notes. And it is one of the best business books I’ve ever read.\n\nThiel’s lessons begin with a simple message: Dominate a small niche and scale up from there. As he explains, “[t]he perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.”\n\nBecause, it is easier to dominate a small market than a large market already filled with competing companies. Thiel gave the exaggerated example of the cure for baldness or a drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, to make the point across. But the message is clear: if we build something valuable that never existed before, the increase in value is theoretically limitless.\n\nHowever, he also throw some cold water over the common believe that great products sell themselves, as plenty of potentially great inventions were born and died without much fanfare. Thiel commented, “[i]f you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no matter how good the product.”\n\nAnd thus he emphasizes the importance of branding, network effects, utilization of technology, etc, including choosing our market carefully and expanding deliberately within it. Chapter 11 on sales, marketing, and advertising covers this in great detail.\n\nAlternatively, if we cannot come up with something revolutionary, as a start up we can instead radically improve an existing solution. As Thiel remarked, “PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times better. Instead of mailing a check that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended. Sellers received their proceeds right away, and unlike with a check, they knew the funds were good.”\n\nAnd this book is filled with tactics and examples for these kinds of improvement insights. For example, Thiel mentions about the metrics that he use to set the limits for effective distribution: “The total net profit that you earn on average over the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV) must exceed the amount you spend on average to acquire a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC). In general, the higher the price of your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale—and the more it makes sense to spend it.”\n\nThe book then step forward to the next progress in a start up: the importance of careful scaling and expansion. Thiel says that there are 2 forms of progress, vertical and horizontal. Vertical progress means doing completely new things (like what Richard Branson have done multiple times from records to airlines to beverages etc), while horizontal progress involves copying things that work, which is a more natural progression. As Thiel commented “[t]he most successful ecompanies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrative.”\n\nThe best example for this horizontal progression is Amazon, where they showed how it can be masterfully done, from books to CDs to pretty much everything today. Here’s Thiel again: “Jeff Bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. There were millions of books to catalog, but they all had roughly the same shape, they were easy to ship, and some of the most rarely sold books—those least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock—also drew the most enthusiastic customers.”\n\nMoreover, in the book Thiel also writes about his experience as an investor looking at businesses from the outside perspective, with special mention of the pareto principle, where roughly 20% of successful investments (or start-up attempts) will outperform the 80% of flops and still leave us with a net gain, sometimes even a big one. He provides a compelling argument using many examples to show the principle at work, which is nothing short of an epiphany for me. The message from him is again simple: in the end it’s about the batting average, not the once (or few) in a lifetime home runs. And this also applies in many other walks of life.\n\nI could really go on and on about the wide range of topics in this dense book, which also teaches us about disruptions, luck, definite and indefinite views of the future. It tells us about when to fight with all we got, when to step back, or when to merge (if you can’t beat them, join them). And ultimately, it provides us with the day-to-day framework to efficiently run a business, which was the main reason why my entrepreneur friend highly recommended this book to me in the first place.",
    "In business, we don’t get the panacea methodology to deliver a market-dominating business or monopoly, and the methodology for the next big thing likely hasn’t been defined yet. We need to look at each business from multiple perspectives and I do believe Peter Thiel provides another unique perspective – not a replacement perspective but an additional one. The research shows that disruptive innovation typically comes from new start companies and they tend to dominate a new market niche until they grow dramatically or are acquired. Iterative innovation in specific markets tends to be dominated by the incumbents, which are usually large multinational companies if the market is lucrative. So I agree with Peter Thiel, that new start businesses need to consider an order of magnitude value step change over existing solutions, to succeed, which is the zero to one transformation.\n\n\"Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as in the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.\"\n\nZero to One suggests a very different method from the lean-agile approach proposed by Steve Blank and Eric Ries in The Four Steps to the Epiphany and The Lean Startup respectively. They suggest that Customer Discovery, Validation, Creation and Building are the cornerstones of the startup approach.\n\nI believe we need to start with a vision of what a successful business would look like, and we need to see that it will be significantly different (10x) from existing competitive solutions. How do we get there? By understanding and executing a market entry path that is iteratively to build, test & learn. I would also question Thiel’s suggestion that only technology enables that step change. In the cited case of Facebook, there were multiple solutions offering social media platforms and it appears the leadership and marketing of Facebook, were more the decisive factors. We could even argue that Facebook is an example of the Eric Ries approach.\n\nThe example of Paypal and Thiel’s insights into the economy and the investment community around the DotCom boom and bust were very interesting. The investor expectations are a constant challenge as I’ve heard from one investor that he wouldn’t get out of bed if a company wasn’t turning over €40million in 3 years and another saying if you showed me figures like that I’d think I was working with idiots with their heads in the clouds.\n\nAfter the main point of vertical innovation is made, the book rambles and while the discussion points are interesting you often wonder what this has that to do with the main premise of the book. The book does feel a little unstructured and elements seem to be included as they were part of a lecture series rather than an integral part of a framework for achieving that 0 to 1 impact.\n\nI would recommend reading this book as it may encourage and inspire you to consider where you want to go with the company and its core solutions. It does, however, need to be tempered with the knowledge that other approaches exist and Peter Thiel may be wrong, at least in parts.",
    "Delivery: On promised day which is 2 days from ordered date. Packaging was good. Book came with air tight seal. Bookmark came with the book.\n\nBook: Feels original, not a digital copy. But paper quality makes it doubtful.\n\nContent: Author express the huge requirement of new ideas and uniqueness. Including success stories of Mark and Musk makes it interesting and inspirational to read.",
    "The book gives a completely new perspective on how businesses should be run or rather on what basis one should even start a company. Discusses mostly about monopoly - and a definition for it. I have come across this measure of monopoly for the first time. The author emphasizes the importance of salesmen. Says the real selling is when customers are not even aware that the selling is happening. And goes on to sell his product, his current investment to the readers - not sure how many realised this. At the end, there was too much focus on trivial and uninteresting things like how founders are eccentric - may be he wants to show the audience that how cool he is. No credit was given to Sean Parker who introduced Zuckerberg to Thiel - the first major outside investment in Facebook. Instead Parker was portrayed as a villain who didn't know what he was doing. It ends with a philosophy called Singularity where there is infinite hope for the future. And according to the author, technology is the only thing that is capable of achieving it - with so many helping move the current scenario from 0 to 1. Other factors like psychology, spirituality, and other unknown realms are completely discounted by the author",
    "In the beginning the author did sound too sure of himself which put me off...but upon giving the book a second try, I realised that he is actually very well credentialed to write the book mainly due to his real life practical experience founding/being part of world changing companies. Very glad that I stuck with the book, learned some amazing things about economics, and most importantly the author gave me PERSPECTIVE on the industry of business and economics as a whole which I am very thankful for.\n\nWould recommend at the least underlining and recapping between readings. Very versatile book to as it caters to not only those who are starting out trying to think of a business idea, but also to those who have a business and are trying to build teams as well as anyone in business who wants to grow.\n\nI have a degree, though with this book I learnt some amazing solid principles about economics and how the world works. What prompted me to give with 5 stars in stead of 4 is that for the majority, the author gave substantial evidence (often real life) to back up his theories and thus I really can't dismiss the book.",
    "A quick presentation of Peter Thiel's somewhat idiosyncratic view of the world. You won't learn much about how to run a startup but will get some amusing views about society and the economy. This perpetuates our society's confusion of luck with judgment, just because someone is rich doesn't man they have any unique insights."

    "As a woman working in a STEM field, I was already aware of biases, differences in pay, workplace harassment, and more against women in the workplace. I have experienced it myself. But this book brings a much-needed investigation that goes far beyond my anecdotal incidents and really looks at the data (both what exists and what is missing) and the consequences of dismissing half of the world’s population as irrelevant or atypical.\n\nThis book is arranged with a preface, introduction, six sections, an afterword, an epilogue specific to Covid-19, and almost 100 pages of endnotes and index. Although the book (sans endnotes and index) is 326 pages long, it is very readable and so brilliantly written that it’s funny, and sad, and insightful, and infuriating, and more all at once. The author brings to light numerous issues that at first glance didn’t really seem to be gender/sex-related at all but after looking at them, they actually are. I think this book would be so helpful for people in many fields, especially in leadership in corporations, government, churches, the medical community, small businesses, and more.\n\nIntroduction: The Default Male\nThe introduction sets up the whole book to show how nearly universally, a default male (body, size, height, weight, shape, behavior, lifestyle, etc.) is used as the default for data, decisions, planning, policies, history, teaching, models, examples, etc. and how this excludes fully 50% of the world’s population’s experiences, bodies, behaviors, needs, and values.\n\nPart 1: Daily Life\nIn the first chapter, “Can Snow-Clearing be Sexist?”, the author reveals how many activities, like plowing the snow from roads, have been set up based on male norms without consideration of how females have different norms. In the case of clearing the roads and sidewalks for travel and commuting, when women’s needs and patterns were considered, it was found that clearing side roads and sidewalks prior to major roads reduced injuries and accidents and the overall cost of snow conditions compared with the plan which only considered men’s needs and patterns. Chapter two, “Gender Neutral with Urinals”, looks and bathroom usage and compares the usable square footage and time to use restrooms of men’s bathrooms, which can accommodate more men, with the needs of women who cannot use urinals, often have children or elderly to help, and have physical needs which just take longer than men. As such, equal size bathrooms are simply not equitable. And many worldwide women don’t have access to safe facilities at all.\n\nPart 2: The Workplace\nPart 2 has 4 chapters. “The Long Friday” refers to a day when 90% of women in Iceland decided to strike so that their contributions, many unpaid, would be recognized. Statistically, women do far more unpaid work like childcare, elder care, shopping, cooking, and cleaning compared with men. These tasks cannot be skipped; they are essential but unpaid. “The Myth of Meritocracy” shows how advancement in the workplace based on merit favors men who don’t have essential unpaid work to do at home and can invest more at work. Furthermore, men’s accomplishments are recognized and rewarded more often even when they are not more merit-worthy than women. “The Henry Higgens Effect” refers to a character in My Fair Lady who wonders why women can’t be more like men, as if the solution is to force women to act like men rather than recognize that half of the population is not male and behaving like a woman is quite appropriate for women. The final chapter in this section is “Being Worth Less than a Shoe” and discusses workplace safety standards and equipment that were developed for men without consideration for the women and their size and physiological differences. “Women have always worked. They have worked unpaid, underpaid, underappreciated, and invisibly, but they have always worked. But the modern workplace does not work for women. From its location, to its hours, to its regulatory standards, it has been designed around the lives of men and it is no longer fit for purpose. The world of work needs a wholesale redesign – if its regulations, of its equipment, of its culture – and this redesign must be led by data on female bodies and female lives. We have to start recognizing that the work women do is not an added extra, a bonus that we could do without: women’s work, paid and unpaid, is the backbone of our society and our economy. It’s about time we started valuing it.” p142.\n\nPart 3: Design\nIn the section on Design, there are three chapters. “The Plough Hypothesis” looks at cultures where farm equipment, designed for men, allowed men who have significantly more upper body strength and hand grip to become the primary income-generating farmers but in cultures that used hoes, both men and women farmed. Farming practices that favor men aren’t limited to equipment but also impact crop types. Some high-yield varieties increase the time the women had to spend on cooking and preparing the crops and “clean” stoves designed to reduce harmful smoke emissions often increase the effort and time for women to cook and tend to the food. “One-Size-Fits-Men” discusses the issues with equipment, gear, and algorithms designed for an average-sized man and how these ill-fitting products do not properly protect, and sometimes even increase risk because they do not fit properly on women simply because women don’t have the same size, shape, and expression, as an average man. “A Sea of Dudes” shares the difficulties women have getting funding for research and products for women when often men are unaware of the needs of women and don’t value funding products that they themselves don’t need. “Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men. It’s time to start designing women in.” p191.\n\nPart 4: Going to the Doctor\n“When Drugs Don’t Work” looks at the practice of testing drugs and dosages on men without considering how well they work (or don’t work) on women with different hormones and physiology. My mom is only about 85 pounds and I often wonder if the standard male adult dosage is appropriate for her tiny body. “Yentl Syndrome” starts by comparing typical heart attack symptoms in men versus women. Because symptoms in women differ from men, they are often misdiagnosed, sometimes fatally. Male-dominated funding panels impact how research funding is distributed and diseases that impact primarily women are less likely to be funded and studied. Women typically wait longer, take longer to diagnose, are misdiagnosed more often, and are not taken seriously by the medical community.\n\nPart 5: Public Life\n“A Costless Resource to Exploit” delves into the deliberate decision to exclude unpaid women’s work (childcare, elder care, cooking, cleaning, household activities, etc.) in the GDP. “It makes sense only if you see women as an added extra, a complicating factor. It doesn’t make sense if you’re talking about half of the human race. It doesn’t make sense if you care about accurate data.” p241. “From Purse to Wallet” looks at tax codes and how they favor men compared with women, particularly in that joint households receive tax credits to the head of the household, typically the man, and women may not have equal access to this money. “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” continues looking at how male-biased policies and gaps in government thinking are harming women. “The data we already have makes it abundantly clear that female politicians are not operating on a level playing field. The system is skewed towards electing men, which means that the system is skewed towards perpetuating the gender data gap in global leadership, with all the attendant negative repercussions for half the world’s population.” p286.\n\nPart 6: When it Goes Wrong\n“Who will rebuild” shows that “when things go wrong – war, natural disaster, pandemic – all the usual data gaps we have seen everywhere from urban planning to medical care are magnified and multiplied. But it’s more insidious than the usual problem of simply forgetting to include women. Because if we are reticent to include women’s perspectives and address women’s needs when things are doing well, there’s something about the context of disaster, of chaos, of social breakdown, that makes old prejudices seem more justified. The real reason we exclude women is because we see the rights of 50% of the population as a minority interest.” p290. “It’s Not the Disaster that Kills You” continues by pointing out that during disasters, it is women who are disproportionally negatively impacted. Women face increased domestic violence, trauma, displacement, injury, death, and female-specific injustices during warfare, pandemics, and natural disasters.\n\nThe afterword offers some hope when women’s voices are included. Women bring valuable insight into the experiences of half the population and their experiences are good for business, economy, and humanity. The epilogue was added to specifically address the Covid-19 pandemic and, unsurprisingly, the “continual failure to systemically collect and sex-disaggregated data on symptoms, infection rates, and death rates from Covid-19.” p319. And of course, PPE that fit women (like masks) were disproportionally unavailable for the many women in healthcare settings who needed them.\n\nI found this book very well written, meticulously footnoted, and very eye-opening even though I was aware of some of the issues already. I would highly recommend the book to all leaders and all women. Although the author touched on women’s clothing and fashion, I wish she had chewed on it a little more, especially considering how men are able to purchase pants by style, waist size, and inseam whereas rarely are women offered the ability to buy based on measurements and most pants have only one inseam length as if all women are the same shape and height. Women, their bodies, and their needs matter in all areas of life and we should be considered.",
    "The depth and breadth of the research behind this book is incredible. The bibliography is substantial, so if you either don't trust the author or just want to dive in deeper on a particular area the paths are laid out for you. I hope everyone already knows about Crash Test Dummies, but there are nuances and subtleties to that story that I couldn't have imagined without reading this book. An interview with the author piqued my interest, especially when she talked about the Swedish Snow Removal and the Cook Stoves stories. But it's not just the data, online web searches often AMPLIFY the biases that the raw data already has... making things even worse. This is a MUST READ.",
    "I’m dyslexic and have attention issues, so I don’t read often without narration, but this book kept me interested the whole time. It was written very well and intelligently. All of her points are supported by citation. I have always known the general sentiment of this book to be true, but I never knew the details or was ever able to support these points. This really have me a new perspective on a lot of things, including equity and feminism. I will be recommending this book to everyone!",
    "This book is a really great look at the various ways that women are negatively impacted because of bias or just simply not being considered. Reads a bit like a research paper.",
    "This is such a thought provoking, powerful look at the disparity between male and female data. Men, women, everyone needs to read this book. If we refuse to see the problems with the gender data gap, we will never remedy it. Humanity could improve so much in understanding the plights and struggles unique to women, and this book shines a serious light on why the data matters. Read it, you won’t regret it!",
    "Did you know that snow plowing/clearing can be sexist?\n\nYup, it is guys. Major streets, highways, and thoroughfares get most of the attention after a snowfall because duh! people need to drive to work and stuff, right? But, according to the author, this benefits men disproportionately as they have relatively straightforward commuting patterns and are less likely to use public transport. Women, on the other hand, must contend with circuitous patterns of commute (i.e. kid's school, groceries, parents, work, laundry, kid's practice, etc.) that not only expose them to less tidy roads after inclement weather, but also sloppy sidewalks that have shown to result in more injuries which translate to lost productivity and eventually more expenditure on healthcare programs, etc. And that's just the appetizer...\n\nSo....women are difficult to measure, non-linearly commuting humans that do 75% percent of the world's unpaid labor, who are disproportionally affected by cuts to social programs, who are constantly being subjected to an infuriating double standard, and whose contributions to the nation's GDP has been largely unaccounted for.\n\nIf you are not the \"default human\" in most studies (i.e. a male) then grab some calming chamomile tea and take your blood pressure medication or something cause each chapter is sure to make your blood boil. If you are a \"default human\" however, then be prepared to have an entirely new understanding of the word privilege...\n\nThere is some overreaching in terms of the arguments that caused me to squint and purse my lips the way I do when I'm extremely skeptical about something, like when she presented the idea that it's hard for women to perform similarly to men in construction jobs cause cement bags are just too darn big and so are bricks! If they were to change the world standard for bricks though...problem solved eh?\n\nAlso, apparently men drove the trend towards bigger and bigger phones, cause we have big manly hands and we can handle them whereas women must contort their digits in all kinds of ways causing them much discomfort. But they do make them smaller I thought? Anyways, the point is that they won't fit in their darn pants pockets! By Jove, If the patriarchy just stopped designing Lululemons, yoga pants, skinny jeans, pantsuits and tiny purses, then...Hmmm. Methinks women in the fashion industry have it well within their province to address these issues, yes?\n\nIn general tough, this book is an eye-opening, world-view changing kind of work that has research in spades and deserves every accolade and award thrown its way.\n\nMust read recommendation!",
    "I bought this book intending it to be a gift for a family member. We have a shared interest in statistics and this seemed like a good punt. Unfortunately it will not be passed on.\n\nFirstly the positives:\nThe author is clearly very passionate about her field and has put together a truly awe inspiring set of statistics that completely support the stance that women are biased against in society. This clearly needs to change, and there are some very good examples of where this could be done easily and effectively. It has been an eye opener to me to consider some of the examples brought up, crash test dummies, drug testing and outdated sexist guidance in a number of areas.\n\nThe negatives:\nThere is a consistent pattern of stating a set of statistics, and then expressing an opinion that this is an example of gender bias which could be fixed with gender disaggregated data. On a first read the conclusions, which seem consistently that men make decisions and that those decisions are implicitly designed to make women worse off off, are not entirely supportable by the statistics gathered.\n\nAs an example, snow sweeping - which is carried out by clearing the main roads first and then minor roads. The statement made is that this is biased against women as this benefits those commuting by car (men) and harms (physically) those who travel on minor roads as pedestrian (women). The conclusion that data should have been gathered which included more women to prevent this bad decision.\nFirstly, it could be plausible that the decision makers - being commuters by car themselves - might have made a decision based upon their experience. This is in and off itself is decoupled from gender. One could imagine a mixed panel of working men and working women making the same poor decision with equal gender representation.\nSecondly, the bias that exists seems to be that men benefit more from the status quo than women due to the nature of the jobs they do (paid work, full time, greater male proportion). The imbalance here is not how streets are cleared but who the jobs are carried out by - so addressing gender bias via the job market would be a better path to removing the gender bias without addressing the poor decision making of how to clear snow.\nThirdly, if one were to gather gender dis-aggregated data this might incentivise equal gender participation. However, this does not guarantee that the set of people involved were from different selection groups and might still exclude those \"people\" that do not commute via main roads. I am sure plenty of women also benefited from the 'main road first' approach - so one could imagine a poll of opinions which covers 50/50 by gender but excludes non-commuters.\n\nAll of the above are independent on what the best way to clear snow is and what we even mean by \"best\" in this context (cheapest for execution, reducing road accidents, reducing hospital attendance).\n\nI've already fixated on this one example too much, there are others but if you have read this far I risk boring you too much. The issues raised in the book could probably more accurately be expressed as a journey into poor decision making by excluding groups given selection bias. The biases are not specifically gender and do not generally indicate a bias against women (there are other biases and poor decision making at play that predominantly harm women as a side effect) - although there are also examples of terrible bias that deserve to be considered - crash test dummies for everyone please!!\n\nI think the author sets off with an axe to grind, and spends the book grinding it. If you are feminist or pro-equality with a view that the world is biased there will be a lot to enjoy here. If you attack it objectively there are still some gems with regards to systemic bias but there are plenty of opinions that do not bear up to analysis.\n\nOverall a good book (I think), just lacking a level of objective scientific rigor that would have made it's message more convincing.",
    "First things first: the designer of this book was clearly on a roll. The font is clear and delightful. The italics, in particular, are so beautiful I had to take a picture of them and send it to my friend so he could appreciate them too. The cover design is subtle and fantastic. When you take the dustjacket off, the overlaid blue male figures disappear, leaving the invisible women behind, which ties in wonderfully with the book’s overarching message. The texture of the dustjacket and hardcover is delightful, with a velvety-smooth overlay that is really pleasing to the touch.\n\nThe book is heavily referenced throughout with endnotes. These are collected directly after the acknowledgements, a full 69 pages of references. The impact of this collected body of commentary serves to underline the density of information and dedication of the research which went into this book. While I’m not a fan of endnotes, personally, the stylistic choice to collect them all together gives undeniable weight to the book, and makes it difficult to dismiss its conclusions.\n\nBut that’s enough about the physical construction of this book (for which Chatto and Windus deserves great praise). What about the content itself?\n\nWell, I read this book with a combination of mounting horror, frustration, and rage. Criado Perez takes the reader by the hand and gently leads them along a journey of discrimination against women which is endemic in all areas of life. Split into six thematic sections (Daily Life, The Workplace, Design, Going to the Doctor, Public Life, and When it Goes Wrong), this book catalogues a pantheon of circumstances where what is female is considered as abnormal, as less than standard, as Other. Collected together, the ignorance of design to the differing needs of 50% of the population is both fascinating and incredibly infuriating.\n\nCriado Perez doesn’t use this book as a stick with which to beat the patriarchy, however. Rather, she delicately unpicks the circumstances which lead to a lack of consideration of the needs of those other than what is considered to be the default. Her examples are wide-ranging, touching on every area of life, and consistently return the same conclusion: women just haven’t been thought about. It’s not that their needs have been considered and dismissed. It’s that the fact that they might have different needs hasn’t even occurred to the people creating these structures.\n\n(Generally. There are some notable exceptions. One quote from Tim Schalk really burned my cookies. But it’s not actually the norm.)\n\nFrom Sheryl Sandberg’s explanation at Google that heavily pregnant women can’t walk long distances to Apple Health’s omission of allowing tracking of a menstrual cycle, for many examples in this book, the reason for these omissions is that people didn’t even think of them as a potential need. Cars are crash tested rigorously before making it to market – but the dummies used are 1.7m tall. This is the size of the average man, not the size of the average person, and it leads to shocking statistics like the fact that women – despite being less likely to crash – if they are involved in a crash, are 47% more likely to be seriously injured. Criado Perez points out myriad ways that this unthinking acceptance of male as default – and as applicable to all – unfairly impacts on women, and leads to their being unconsidered in further development.\n\nThe book has one overarching message, which calls clearly from every page. Do something about this. Don’t accept data as applicable to all. Sex-disaggregate data, and investigate how men and women are differently impacted. In an era which relies on big data more than ever, the gender data gap needs to be acknowledged, counteracted, and filled. And it needs to be done with a specific focus on counteracting the detriment which the gender data gap had caused. Otherwise we end up with situations where a policy designed to create more family-friendly situations actually end up disadvantaging those it intended to help.\n\nCriado Perez is not myopic in her discussions either – she skillfully acknowledges the intersections of race, gender identity, disability, and other minority identities can have to create a cumulatively detrimental effect. Invisible Women is a primer on how not to design, a feminist manifesto, a fantastic example of hard research with incredible readability, and a thoroughly engaging experience. It has filled me with rage and frustration – my friends and family have borne the brunt of several rants already – and I’ll be passing it on and recommending it to pretty much everyone I know.",
    "This book is amazing at opening the door on invisible bias, unfortunately I am not a fan of the writing style.\n\nThe author makes fantastic points backs it up with great facts but then in an attempt to cement her point she will suddenly and needlessly jump to unrelated examples of sexism e.g. she makes fantastic eye opening points on why women's toilets should be bigger than men's but then jumps from discussing women's needs and toilet requirements in the West to toilet issues faced by women in India (this just belittles her first point).\n\nShe also uses the term 'White Men' a lot, I really cannot stand generalisations but stuck with it. The author seems blame all the issues faced by women on men but reading this book makes you think a lot of these issues are a product of their time and are now a systematic societal issue which is as much women's fault as men's; for example 76% of teachers are women and women by far make up the majority of childcare, so why/how are children still being raised with a male gender bias? We have everything we need to change it so why hasn't it been changed? the reason is because the women themselves (and men) don't know issues exist, both genders need educating on these issues.\n\nEveryone should read this book as it provides great insight into bias we cannot see but live with but I think blaming one gender for the issues faced by another will create division and stall progression.",
    "Firstly, this is a great read. The reader is taken on a tour of an unknown yet familiar world as the author lays out the facts and costs of the gender data gap. You can't get accurate answers if you don't have quality data- or if you don't ask the right questions in the first place. This isn't presented as a conspiracy against women but as the result of just not seeing slightly more than half the population in the data. The results can range from the inconvenient (not being able to access tall shelves or straps on the Underground) to the fatal (women and men react differently to drugs but mostly only male data is recorded.) The most common reaction to these problems where they are recognised is to try and \"fix\" women to be more like men (suggesting voice coaching for women to use voice recognition software that responds to male voices). This is a valuable and useful book. Please buy one for the engineer in your life.",
    "The brilliance in this book is that Criado Perez presents multiple examples of a blatant male bias in the aggregate data being used to make decisions that affect women and men and leaves it sitting there for all to see that acceptance of the status quo is untenable, for any progressive and healthy society. There is no man-bashing here, thankfully. On the contrary, Caroline states that this gender bias is not malicious, it is and always has been unintentional, but it does disadvantage women in terms of vehicle safety, healthcare, and in myriad other ways. As a parent of three girls and two boys, several of whom are pursuing careers in STEM, this text is incredibly relevant to us. I could waffle on about the ways that this bias exists and that my offspring have encountered ad nauseam, from lab coats and goggles in only male sizes to consultants that think girls only exist to make coffee and look pretty. Enlightening, fascinating and mind-blowing data presented in an engaging and entertaining format - a very worthy 5 stars!\n\nI saw Caroline being interviewed at the Edinburgh book festival recently and was impressed by her candour about the online threats she has received simply by putting her head above the parapet to campaign to have just one woman represented on the new bank notes and also by her reticence in being perceived as a strident feminist. What she has written here is simply a factual representation but it has brought her into the line of fire from all kinds of misogynists and people who would wish to silence the voice of truth and reason. These entrenched biases are not going to be corrected overnight, despite how detrimental some of them are to us as women, but the more of us who tentatively stand up and say 'actually, we matter as well' then perhaps the more likely we are to finally be heard. Although in the current political climate - terrifyingly - the reverse might be true."

    "New york time’s best seller, “Contagious: why things catch on”, by Jonah Berger, goes through many examples of the methods used to catch the attention of the majority of people, and what gets ignored. Berger says “regardless of how plain or boring a product or idea may seem, there are ways to make it contagious…”. The author presents real life examples to illustrate points in order to inform the reader on why things catch on, in a marketing perspective. Berger has studied why things go “viral” and claims that most communications of products are not through the internet, but by word-of-mouth. This book is useful when learning about why some businesses fail and others have booming businesses. It is split up by the acronym STEPPS- Social currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical value, and Stories, with examples of real businesses in each, which is also useful.\nTraditional marketing suggests that the factors that determine a business’ or product’s success are quality, price, and the advertising. Berger explains that it is much deeper than that, and that the more important factors are word-of-mouth transmission and social influence. Word-of-mouth is much more effective because it is persuasive, because people trust more what others recommend rather than what they see on T.V. or social media. This was very interesting to read and I agree with his points- and the numbers prove it accounts for 20-50% of all purchasing decisions. Shockingly, only 7% of word-of-mouth advertising is done through social media.\nThe author's main arguments are split up by the STEPPS acronym, and each is successfully argued with facts and experience. The first chapter starts with Social currency. This chapter puts emphasis on being “in the know” on something, and wanting to share it with others. The example Berger used was the hot dog restaurant having a secret bar hidden with a secret door in a phone booth. The restaurant and bar have done well for years because people feel like they are “in the know” and recommend it to others, as if they are a part of some big secret. The next chapter, Triggers, is about how one thing triggers another. Such as buying coffee and donuts, peanut butter and jelly, and specifically in the book it is mentioned that the Mars candy company saw a spike in sales during the time in 1997 when NASA was organizing a mission to Mars. Emotion is all about how when something provokes emotion or inspires you, you are more likely to share it. Public is about how people imitate others, with the example of how people are more likely to choose a restaurant or store that has more people in it, and to walk past the ones that are empty. Next, practical value is about how important information is more useful to share, and relies heavily on buyer behavior because people like to help others . Finally, stories explains how a good story is likely to be told especially when it provokes emotion, and thus makes people want to share it with others.\nIn my opinion, “Contagious: why things catch on” by Jonah Berger is a very interesting read with useful information. As soon as you pick up the book it is difficult to put it down, as it keeps the audience engaged and interested. It is very easy to understand and it allows the reader to put into perspective that marketing is deeper than just advertising on social media. This book could be particularly very useful to students who are interested in studying marketing, interested in psychology and why people are influenced by certain things and not others, or people who have plans to start a business- or just anyone on social media. “Contagious” could even be useful to people who simply do not want to be manipulated by businesses and gain the ability to see through the different marketing strategies. Not only are you given real life scenarios and statistics, but also you are shown proof on how STEPPS can help create a booming business. The stories that are provided are especially useful as they keep the reader engaged while also providing useful information. The only negative of this book I found was the way it is written, as it repeats a lot and could be interpreted as reading a children’s book, and some may get a bit bored. Readers may want to skip over parts as it repeats the same ideas during the chapter and may find it to be a bit redundant at times.\nOverall the information is useful enough that I did not mind it too much as I found it just makes it a quick read on why things go viral and how businesses manipulate customers. I enjoyed reading this book, and if you plan on developing a marketing plan or strategy for your business, “Contagious: why things catch on” would be useful to test the strategies to make sure it would be successful. The author successfully explains the STEPPS to making a business successful and used his own education and research to back up the claims being made. The book did not really come off as persuasive, just informative of what works and what does not. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about how marketing strategies work and how companies can manipulate you.\nSimilar books to “Contagious” include: \"Diffusion of Innovations,\" by Everett Rogers, “Influence” by Robert B. Cialdini, and “The Nuclear Effect” by Scott Oldford. Jonah Berger also has other books that talk about marketing and how to influence other people, such as “The Catalyst” and “Invisible Influence”. Overall, “Contagious” by Jonah Berger is an excellent book to start off with if you want to understand the aspects of marketing and advertising and what can make a company successful, especially when today it is harder than ever to find what will stick to consumers, this book brings about the most effective and prosperous ways on making your product or business contagious.",
    "Create an exceptional product or service, which you can sell at a great price, throw some advertising at it, and you just have to succeed. Right?\nNot even close.\nIf a fellow foodie raves about a new restaurant you would be more likely to try it than you would if you saw an advert for it. One of the most compelling reasons for trying a different product or service is because someone you trust recommends it to you. Word of mouth is a powerful force.\nWith the advent of online social media, broadcasting an opinion has never been easier. Vast numbers of friends, and friends of friends, can be reached with little effort. This fact leads to the conclusion that most word of mouth has its origin through this medium.\nResearch by the Keller Fey Group finds that only 7%, (not 70%, not even 17%,) of word of mouth happens online! The amount of time we spend online might be high, but the amount of time we spend offline is way higher. Even if online does have greater reach, offline conversations have power way beyond the capability of online.\nSo why are some products, ideas and behaviours talked about more than others?\nThis is the question that Wharton professor, Jonas Berger, has spent ten years studying and answers in this book. His answers are not speculative or theoretical; rather they are fact based conclusions. From his own research and that of others, Berger has identified a set of six principles which cause products, services and ideas to spread like a virus.\nThe six principles are: social currency, triggers, emotion, public, practical value and stories. Together the principles form the acronym STEPPS and the more of these that are present, the more likely an idea is to spread.\nPeople don’t share everything with everyone because most ideas are of little interest to them. In the same way that the car we drive and the clothes we wear influences how others perceive us, so does what we talk about. If we want to be seen as sophisticated, contemporary, successful or knowledgeable, we will choose to talk about matters that reflect this.\nOn the other hand, not to bore people, we choose who to tell what to, and when, in order for the social currency of our content to be most effective.\nIn New York City there is genuine “old hole-in-the-wall” hot dog restaurant that serves 17 varieties of hot dogs. At the far end of the restaurant is a vintage wooden telephone booth complete with a vintage telephone. Dial 2 and you will be asked, “Do you have a reservation?” If you do, a secret door on the other side of the booth will open and you enter a pub called “Please Don’t Tell.\nReservations to this pub open daily at 3:00 and by 3:30 it is fully booked making it one of the most sort after drinking spots in New York.\nKnowing about the pub, and even better, having been there, gives you a social currency that makes you look good in certain groups. That is why you tell others about “Please Don’t Tell.”\nTalking about the unusual pub you visited on your last trip to New York will generate interest, but can the mundane do the same? The second principle, the Trigger, shows it can.\nIn an experiment designed to understand how to change eating behaviour, students were shown one of two slogans: “Live the healthy way, eat five fruits and veggies a day” and “Each and every dining-hall tray needs five fruits and veggies a day.” In all they saw the slogan 20 times in different fonts and colours and were asked to evaluate the slogan they saw.\nThat trays need fruit and vegetables was rated “corny” and was deemed to be less than half as attractive as the “live healthy” slogan. Additionally, the live healthy was viewed as far more likely to change their behaviour.\nStudents who saw the “tray” slogan ate 25% more vegetables than the “healthy way” group. The reason is that they use trays to collect their food every day, and the trays acted as a memory trigger.\nThe slogan “Kit Kat and Coffee” revived the sales of Kit Kat in the US not only because of the memorable alliteration. Kit Kat and coffee do not go better together than Kit Kat and hot milk, but coffee is a more frequently consumed beverage than milk and so provides many more triggers each day for eating a Kit Kat.\nTriggers also get us talking about a subject and the more triggers there are, the more we talk.\nClearly, if the subject also has the right amount of the right emotion attached to it, the chances of it being talked about are far higher. If the idea can be translated into something visible and public, it will spread faster. If many people have bought in already, we are more likely to believe it than if few have.\nArmstrong’s Livestrong bright yellow rubber wrist bands went viral for exactly this reason – publicly visible support for a good cause – support for cancer sufferers.\nVirtually anything can become contagious if the right ingredients are present. The ability to go viral isn’t born, it is made - and this is extremely important news!\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\nIan Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy",
    "I’m currently earning my Master’s in Public and Organizational Relations while also helping run a music production company and this book has been so helpful! The writing is not only informative, but it is also conversational with great examples and wit. I don’t think I’ve ever said this about a nonfiction book, but I couldn’t put it down! Highly recommend!",
    "Fast pace and easy to understand book. Written by an academic in a very simplified way to be easily digested by anyone. It is full with real life examples and with research results. It may seems repetitive since it has a few points to make and expands in more pages than needed. I take it as a concept book which helps put the thoughts in order and explain why marketing messages work where others not.",
    "Love the little stories that are used as examples, I couldn't stop sharing them around my peers. I'm not an expert on social media or even word of mouth marketing but I ve tried my fair amount during my time at university. This book is well researched, accessible and just an eye opener when it comes to today's practices of guerrilla marketing. If you want to start a small business or even just a professional YouTube or Instagram account I'd suggest starting with this one. One because as said multiple times word of mouth marketing is free and two because as a book it says something different in comparison to all the 'social media gurus' who claim that you can do any kind of business just by sharing, liking and posting at particular times during the day.",
    "I find the subject both interesting and useful; shame this book reads as if it were written with a reader of limited attention span and intelligence in mind. I struggle to believe that this was written by an academic expert - the writing style is repetitive and lacks depth. The reader is evidently expected to be amazed by stories in which every detail is explained as if to a child. An incredibly frustrating and irritating book.",
    "I’m currently building my knowledge for a venture I’m about to undertake, this book has been invaluable!",
    "A very useful book. The only downside is that is too long and the key points could have been reflected in the much shorter version."

    "I've enjoyed Gladwell's work over the years, even though it's clear he cuts corners, smooths down facts, cherry-picks evidence, and so on. I enjoy a good storyteller who connects his tales to ideas. So I'm not anti-Malcolm.\n\nThat said, this book is a terrible disappointment. Gladwell makes all kinds of wild leaps, without logic or evidence. He seems to have a strange hatred for Hotchkiss School, belittles lawyers and Ivy League schools, and too often just does not do his homework.\n\nThe biggest failure here is the publishing industry. Lusting after yet another Gladwell bestseller, his editors did not challenge him to deliver his best product.\n\nImagine if Gladwell had heeded advice like this (which originally appeared in www.writing-hacks.com) . . .\n\nDear Mr. Gladwell,\n\nWe were pleased to get the manuscript of David and Goliath for consideration at [name of publisher redacted]. We know of your success with previous pop-scholarship books. The title suggests a powerful \"high concept\" book. And we love--lovelovelove--high-concept books like Salt and Cod and A History of the World in Five Glasses and, yes, The Tipping Point and Blink and Outliers. When you see the title, you instantly get the premise--a promise of a unique and satisfying angle. So we loved your title and what it promised.\n\nWe're going to have to pass on the manuscript, though. I'd like you to rethink the concept and do more research. Right now, the book is a loose collection of anecdotes, which take huge leaps of logic, offer scanty evidence, and contains contradictions that undermine your case.\n\nThe biggest problem, though, is that the book doesn't really take on the David and Goliath phenomenon. Sure, some sections talk about the ability of the little guy to defeat the big guy (my favorite story is about the girls basketball team that triumphs with aggressive full-court play). But more often, your discussion ranges far from that theme. Your themes include, in no particular order: the importance of \"multiple intelligences,\" the power of grit and willpower, the effect of peers on behavior, the dynamics of civil disobedience, the power of buzz, the strength of love, the potential of detailed research to yield new insight, and the psychological need for belonging. I'll get to all that in a minute.\n\nI want to publish your book--what editor doesn't want to acquire a best-selling author?--but I simply cannot find a theme in this pudding.\n\nTHEME\n\nRather than just saying \"there's no there there,\" let me explain what I mean. If you were to conduct more rigorous research and recast the work, you might consider a number of frameworks. Consider, for example:\n\nPossible theme No. 1: The Master-Slave Dialectic: This is a key insight in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, probably due for a popularization. (If you don't do it, Alain de Botton will!) The idea is simple: Even powerful people need recognition from the peons below them. When peons refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of their superiors, those peons gain surprising leverage. This is close to the David-and-Goliath theme, but still different. Hegel's dialectic shows the complexity of the psychological give-and-take in human affairs, rather than a simple confrontation of powerful and weak. A couple of your stories fit this theme:\n\n* Andre Trocme is a minister in a Vichy-occupied village in France. When the Nazis demand recognition of their rule, should he accede or fight? Or is there a third way--strategic defiance and withdrawal?\n\n* Wyatt Walker, Martin Luther King's assistant, is eager to find a way to break the back of segregation in Birmingham. How do you change the dynamic of the civil rights movements when King has suffered defeats and most of white America is indifferent? Do you create a spectacle--or is it more complicated than that?\n\nPossible theme No. 2: Achieving Mastery in a Messy and Indifferent World: Sounds like a how-to book, I know, but you could get away with it. This might be your best bet, if you want to keep most of your anecdotes. Everyone in your manuscript has to confront more difficult situations than they might choose. The world is messy, complex, and quite frankly indifferent to any person's fate. (There's an idea for a title: Man's Fate. Andre Malraux might not approve, but he's dead.) Think of the subjects of your work:\n\n* Vivek Ranadive wants to coach his daughter's basketball team to play well. But his players are small, weak, and inexperienced. Stronger teams won't give his girls a break. Or will they, unwittingly? How can he exploit opponents' lack of imagination?\n\n* Caroline Sacks discovers that science courses at Brown are hard--and her classmates are competitive and not eager to share. Should she give up? Buckle down? Get out of Dodge?\n\n* Teresa DeBrito is a principal of a middle school where enrollment has declined drastically, taking away some of the buzz of the class routines. What can she do to engage distracted teenagers in the classroom?\n\nPossible theme No. 3: Finding Voice in a Noisy World: To deal with huge challenges, people need to ignore the babel of voices around them. They need to hear their inner voice and find their truest values. When you know what really matters, everything else is easier to bear.\n\n* Wilma Derkson loses her daughter to an awful murder. Should she lash out with anger--or find a way to deepen her considerable love and humanity and to build a better world?\n\n* Rosemary Lawlor is a Catholic mother and housewife in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The British police run roughshod over Catholics. What can change the dynamics of this war-torn isle?\n\n* David Boies is dyslexic and struggles to read. Should he work construction or find a job that challenges him more intellectually? Since he's a lousy reader, how can learn and communicate?\n\nPossible theme No. 4: Beating the Odds: What happens when you live in a world of rigid standards and practices? How can you persevere in the face of widespread disapproval--and make gambles that might pay off for years, if ever?\n\n* Jay Freireich wants to find new ways to treat children with leukemia. But other doctors and researchers are dubious--and even say Freireich's aggressive treatment is inhumane. How can he find a way to give his \"cocktail\" of medications--and relentless chemotherapy--a chance?\n\nMaybe these themes lack the same sex appeal of David and Goliath, which is, after all, one of the great parables of western civilization. But they deal, more coherently, with the stories you tell.\n\nMaybe you can't use all the stories you offer in this manuscript. That's OK. The best works of literature come not just what's in them but also what's not in them. Anyway, you simply need to work hard--adding and subtracting and shaping--till you get the theme that truly unifies your work without simplifying too much.\n\nIf you want to keep all your pieces, don't present them as a unified argument. Just say: Musings of a Pop Journalist, or some such.\n\nRESEARCH AND EVIDENCE\n\n\"When you can't create,\" Henry Miller once said, \"you can work.\"\n\nDavid and Goliath feels like a mish-mash. Maybe you focus so much on creating a neat theory that you didn't do the necessary work to test and prove that theory.\n\nSometimes, the separate pieces read like first drafts of magazine or newspaper articles. You often rely on one or two books or articles, it seems, when you could do a lot more research--doing library research, digging into archives, and interviewing participants. I noticed that your weakest passages--like your strange attack on the Hotchkiss School--did not appear in The New Yorker. I'm not surprised. No way David [Remnick, the editor] would allow that in his magazine.\n\nWhich reminds me. You once said something at a conference that concerns me.\n\nI attended a Nieman conference on narrative journalism back in 2003, when you were the keynote speaker. You said you need to spend only a day or two with a subject to understand what makes him or her tick. Your point, I think, was that your profiles focus more on ideas than personalities. You care about Lois Weisberg because of the idea she represents--that \"weak ties\" bind communities better than strong ties--and not because of her life story. Fair enough.\n\nNow, I know you conduct more than one interview with some of your subjects. But David and Goliath takes a one-and-done approach too often. In fact, your section on Wyatt Walker shows no real first-hand understanding of the subject. You could have interviewed dozens of the Birmingham movement's activists, including Walker himself, but instead you relied mostly on Diane McWhorter's book Carry Me Home. As a result, your account is thin and misleading. I wish you had read The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement, by Aldon Morris. You get a getter idea of how the Birmingham campaign succeeded.\n\nLet's get specific. True, as you say, Americans were shocked by the photograph of dogs attacking a slight black boy near a demonstration. True, most people don't realize that the dog's victim was not a protester but a bystander. True, Walker was pleased by the ugly display of police brutality, since it revealed the fundamental violence of segregation.\n\nBut the Birmingham campaign was much more than a photo op. Fundamentally, Project C was a \"withdrawal of consent\" from the segregationist regime. No regime, King understood, lasts long when people reject its legitimacy. In the campaign's many phases--the sit-ins, boycotts, marches, jailings, and eventually the occupation of downtown--activists refused to play by segregationist rules. Yes, the photo was dramatic. But without everything else, it would have revealed little more than one nasty man's meanness and temper. Oh, yes: Why no word about King's iconic \"Letter From Birmingham Jail\"?\n\nI also wonder about your account of the Impressionists. You depict them as renegades who snubbed the Salon in order to display their work in their own shows. But that's not quite right. They pursued the Salon, again and again. And when Manet got in, his work created a buzz. Granted it was a negative buzz--but people were talking. Later, when the Impressionists held their own show, they benefitted from the advance PR.\n\nAnd why the sneering attack on the Hotchkiss School? You argue--with no evidence whatsoever--that its small classes \"so plainly make its students worse off.\" Huh? Parents send kids there, you say, because they \"fell into the trap\" of assuming that \"the kinds of things that wealth can buy translate into real-world advantages.\" Seduced by Hotchkiss' gorgeous campus and amenities, you say, parents spend big bucks and get those awful small classes. Malcolm, get a grip. Have you ever taught a class? I don't mean standing in the front of a vast auditorium, but working closely with people, on their terms? Do you know what happens when students gather around a Harkness Table? Think back to your days at the University of Toronto. Do you remember seminar classes, with a dozen students? Those seminars can be amazing. Where is your evidence that small classroom conversations fail? You don't have any because it doesn't exist.\n\nYou say bigger classes have greater diversity. But large numbers don't always produce diverse, open-minded discussion. A class of 20 or 30 often explores fewer ideas than a class of 12. It depends on how engaged the students are, how challenging the culture. If you think diverse expression comes from students with different life experiences, consider that Hotchkiss students come from 28 countries and most of the states of the U.S. Yes, it's elite--and rich. But Hotchkiss also offers generous scholarships. Some 37 percent of all students are on financial aid, with an average grant of $32,500.\n\nOne more thing. Why sneer at the Steinway pianos at Hotchkiss? If you had written about Hotchkiss in Outliers, you would have extolled the virtues of making instruments available to young musicians. You celebrated Bill Gates's unusual access to computers in high school; why not celebrate the future maestro's access to great instruments? After all, don't musicians need 10,000 hours of practice too?\n\nTHE LOGIC\n\nYour logic regularly misses the mark. You often state (or imply) that X causes Y when you see X and Y together. But of course, the world is never so simple. Lots of variables swirl around all the X's and Y's of all stories. You need to define the variables--and then use consistent definitions. Then you need to \"isolate the variables\" to show which ones exert more force than others.\n\nTake the story of Caroline Sachs. You argue that she made a mistake in choosing Brown over Maryland because she struggled with core science courses at Brown. Why not star at a lesser school, you say, instead of struggling at a great school? Why not, in your terms, be a big fish in a small pond rather than a small fish in a big pond? Your charts show that students in the top decile of a number of schools - public and private - publish more papers and win more honors than students lower in the class rankings. Let's put aside your own incredulity at the fact that non-Ivies do good work. Your point is that middling achievement at Brown \"made her feel stupid,\" damaged her self-esteem, killed her love of science.\n\nMaybe, but I'm not persuaded. Let's start with definitions. True, Brown is a more elite school, but that hardly makes it a bigger pond. Strictly by the numbers, Maryland is more than four times bigger than Brown (26,000 to 6,000 students). I know you mean Brown has a \"bigger\" status, but this can be confusing.\n\nI asked an official at Maryland for his perspective. He started with the numbers:\n\n\"Maryland is a much bigger pond than Brown. We have more than 5,000 natural sciences/computer science/math majors and 3,800 engineering majors. Brown University's total enrollment in all disciplines is 6,100. [Note: Brown graduates about 600 science students a year.] Therefore we have many more STEM fish than Brown has undergraduates.\n\n\"We also have many big fish, earning distinctions like Goldwater Scholarships, other national fellowships, etc. Such outcomes are not the province of the Ivies alone. In fact, publicly available data on Goldwater Scholarship Winners over the last 5 years - University of Maryland 14, Brown University 3. Even if you compensate for total undergraduate enrollment (our undergrad student body is four times that of Brown), we are still ahead. And both schools only get 4 nominations each year.\"\n\nOK, maybe you didn't mean big and small pond in such a literal way. You were referring to Brown's \"big pond\" status and Maryland's \"small pond\" status, right? But that's not quite fair either. Sure, Ivy admissions are absurdly competitive, state universities less so. But does that mean their STEM classes require less work? Not necessarily.\n\n\"A student who struggles with early science classes at Brown will also struggle with early science classes at Maryland. In fact, it may initially be even more difficult for such a student at a flagship university, as introductory classes tend to be larger, and students who are struggling may not stand out as much. However, I suspect Brown's introductory courses are fairly large as well.\n\n\"However, she may find herself among more female science and engineering majors than she would see at Brown, and this might encourage her persistence and success!\"\n\nBy your own account, Caroline took too many classes and extracurriculars in her freshman year. And she did get a B-minus in the critical chemistry class. Who says struggling with a difficult subject should drive her away? If she were a true David, why shouldn't she face those tough challenges? Won't that sharpen her resolve?\n\nSince you like anecdotes, let me tell you one. When I was a student at Vanderbilt I had a friend named Tom who desperately wanted to be a doctor. But he struggled, semester after semester. So he started taking liberal arts courses and enjoyed himself for the first time. But he still had the science bug. So after Vanderbilt, he took pre-med classes at Millsaps College. He excelled, went to med school, and eventually did a residency at Vanderbilt. You might say he made it by going to a small pond. But he excelled in both the big and small ponds. Years later, he looked back with happiness that he had learned how to struggle. He felt \"stupid\" sometimes, sure. But he persevered, looked for different routes to his goal. He didn't succeed right away. But he found his own path. Maybe that approach would work for Caroline too.\n\nIf Caroline really loves science--really loves science--don't you think she'll find her place? Maybe Maryland would have been a better choice, maybe not. But she doesn't need to take a straight line to her goal. In fact, a meandering route, with some wrecks along the way, might make her a more complete human being.\n\nDoesn't a college education mean more than grades and job prospects? In one of your most moving sections, you describe the courage of Andre Trocme against the Nazis. Why did he settle in this remote village in the first place? Not because of his job prospects, but because his pacifism isolated him from the French Protestant Church. If he had cared about conventional success, he wouldn't have taken this route. But he wanted to live a decent life.\n\nWon't Caroline live a good life if she pursues what she loves, regardless of where she finishes in her class and what accolades she receives? If she's smart, hard-working, and open-minded, she'll find her sweet spot. It's when we try to game the system that we lose out on what matters.\n\nFor such a contrarian, you seem to accept some tired old ideas about how education works. In a Gladwell school, teachers stand in the front of the room and tell their kids what they need to learn, then solicit responses from the kids. You quote, approvingly, a teacher fretting about students \"talking about something that has nothing to do with what they're supposed to be working on.\" Ah, so everyone in your big classes should all focus on the teacher in the front of the room. In a Gladwell school, success is measured by tests and awards, rather than the joint exploration of ideas. This is a sad, impoverished ideal of education, Malcolm. I suggest you put Ken Robinson's The Element on your reading list.\n\nYou take logical leaps all over the book. Consider the story of Jay Freireich, the doctor who fought to provide more aggressive treatment for leukemia. But your explanation--that his unhappy childhood gave him the determination to fight the good fight-- is facile at best. All our joys and sorrows make us who we are. But without some kind of inspiration--which he got from his family physician and high school physics teacher--his rough childhood might have broken him. So maybe it was the nurturers who gave Freireich his fire, not the tragedies of his childhood. It's hard to say. Lots of people with rough childhoods fail to persevere; lots of people with happy childhoods do persevere.\n\nSo here's another logical problem. You depict Freireich as an SOB, a tyrant with \"no patience, no gentleness.\" In fact, one colleague remembers him as \"a giant, in the back of the room, yelling and screaming.\" You call him a David. But is he? Freireich started out a David, for sure. But after he was inspired by others and enrolled at a great state university, he turned into a Goliath. Thank goodness. It took a Goliath to fight the hospital's approach to leukemia treatment. But that doesn't fit your neat interpretation.\n\nLet's look at one more definitional problem. In your account of the Nazi's bombings of London, you note that Winston Churchill and others feared mass panic. But instead, London responded with bravado. Why? The psychologist J.T. MacCurdy argues that those who survive such attacks fall into two groups: the \"near misses\" and the \"remote misses.\" The near misses, MacCurdy says, \"feel the blast, they see the destruction,\" and experience trauma. The remote misses don't experience the horror first hand, avoid the trauma, and respond with a strange sense of invincibility. Fair enough. Experiencing something awful affects people more than hearing about it.\n\nThen you apply this typology to the experience of Fred Shuttlesworth, Martin Luther King's associate who fought for civil rights in Birmingham. You describe the awful day when Klansmen bombed his home. The force of the blast blew windows a mile away. Shuttlesworth was calm. \"The Lord has protected me,\" he said. \"I am not injured.\" Malcolm, you call this \"a classic remote miss\" because he wasn't maimed or badly injured. But he was there, Malcolm--right in the middle of the bombed-out house.\n\nMaybe Shuttlesworth maintained his equanimity because he had already endured so much violence and hatred and survived it? Shuttlesworth and other civil rights heroes knew they faced mortal danger every day. They faced that danger squarely because the cause was too great not to do so.\n\nMaybe something else was involved. Maybe Shuttlesworth found comfort in his faith and in the love of his family and friends? Maybe that faith--a belief in God's undying love and mercy--sustained him. Consider also Dr. King How did he maintain his serenity and humor when a woman stabbed and nearly killed him at a book signing? How did Pope John Paul maintain his spirit when he was shot at St. Peter's Square? I would submit that their faith gave them a heart that helped them overcome the tragedies of life.\n\nSTYLE\n\nNow for a few quibbles about style ...\n\nI love simple writing. When exploring complex ideas, breaking points down into small pieces makes sense. When a complex term comes along--an idea from scholarly research, for example--it makes sense to define it slowly. Let the reader absorb each piece fully. Let the reader build knowledge, block by block.\n\nThis, I must say, you do well. You never--ever--get stuck in the quicksand of arcane, abstract, complex verbiage. I remember when I read your explanation of the \"strength of weak ties,\" an idea that a sociologist named Mark Granovetter developed. I was thrilled because you took this obscure but important concept and you made it simple and compelling for a broad audience. You deserve credit for encouraging journalists of all kinds to explain complex ideas well.\n\nNow, though, you sometimes write like a kindergarten teacher. Your leading questions are cloying. Your use of italics to emphasize points already made well is insulting. Your use of \"we\"--as in, \"Giants are not what we think they are,\" \"We think of underdog victories as improbable events,\" \"We think of things as helpful that actually aren't\"--not only grates but sets up straw men. Language matters.\n\nWith these approaches, I think you mean well. So I was even more annoyed with your snide comments. In describing a Harvard student's move away from the sciences, you say: \"Harvard cost the world a physicist and gave the world another lawyer.\" I have no love of lawyers, but it's a cheap shot--and, in your own reckoning, some lawyers are decent people, like David Boies. And maybe--just maybe--the Harvard student wasn't cut out for science. And are all lawyers really so bad? What about your hero David Boies?\n\nIt's also hard to stomach the easy omniscience of your style. You say Jay Freirich--couldn't remember the name of the woman who raised him \"because everything from those years was so painful.\" Maybe, but it sounds facile. And it's unnecessary.\n\nMOVING FORWARD\n\nSo far I have outlined problems with framing your argument, making theory simplistic, using terminology imprecisely, failing to offer evidence (or ignoring contrary evidence), and creating a simplistic world with your kindergarten style.\n\nBut the problem is deeper--and I can explain it best with reference to your book Blink.\n\nRecall your enthralling account of fake kouros, a marble Greek statue said to date back to the sixth century before Christ. The Getty Museum paid millions to acquire the piece after using the latest scientific analyses to vet its authenticity. But then art historians had a visceral reaction--what one called \"intuitive repulsion\"--to the statue. For reasons they could not articulate right away, the statue didn't look right. It looked too \"fresh.\" In concluding your discussion, you celebrate the power of the \"blink\" judgment. \"Just as we can teach ourselves to think logically and deliberately,\" you say, \"we can also teach ourselves to make better snap judgments.\"\n\nIn that rendering, it sounds like magic. But in Outliers, you get closer to the point: it's all about experience. Those artists could tell the statue was fake because they were immersed, deeply, in art and archaeology. They lived and breathed the world of antiquity. They understood not just surface appearances, but the deeper essence of the thing. That--not just facile understanding of definitions and rules and patterns--is where real understanding comes from.\n\nAnd that's what you're missing. Over the years, you have become entranced with quirky \"rules,\" \"theories,\" and \"patterns\" that explain complex realities of life. But you never go deep. You don't spend significant time with your subjects. You find a great parable and match it with a fun theory. When the theory doesn't fit the parable, you ignore the misfit. Lacking deep knowledge of any subject, you cannot respond critically. And lacking the scientist's respect for difficult problems and disdain of simple answers, you skate forward to new parables and fun theories.\n\nSo, Malcolm, I'm afraid that we cannot accept this manuscript, as is, for publication. I realize that it would sell millions of copies. But in this age of ebooks, we publishers have a challenge. When we take on a major new work, we need to make sure it meets our highest standards. Anyone can patch together a collection of anecdotes and research notes. We need to expect more.\n\nPlease consider our ideas for sharpening the book's focus and strengthening its research and argumentation. If you are committed to producing the best book possible, we will be too.\n\nIf you want to pass on our offer, you might consider taking the manuscript to Little, Brown. They might publish it...",
    "A friend loaned me her copy of David and Goliath because she had a question about the chapter on Caroline Sacks. This book has made me very mad because Mr. Gladwell has greatly over simplified many of his case studies.\n\nThe author's basic premise is that \"the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty.\" Sometimes.\n\"Giants are not what we think they are.\"\nSometimes.\n\"being an underdog can change people in ways that we often fail to appreciate.\"\nSometimes.\n\n\"Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.\"\n- Dire Straits\n\nI find most of the case studies GREATLY oversimplified. In particular the sections on Caroline Sacks, David Boies and Dyslexia, and Emil \"Jay\" Freireich with a hard upbringing. The author's conclusions for the most part are so skewed I am surprised the publisher Little, Brown and Co. put this manuscript to press.\n\nThat said, it IS interesting how often education comes into play in the case studies. From what an optimal class size really means, to the failure of a gifted student to achieve her college goals, and to one dyslexic relying on his abilities of memory and focus to go all the way through law school. Even when the subject at hand is not education, Gladwell brings education into the discussion.\n\nChapter two raises the question of class size. I agree there is a sweet-spot for how many students should be in a class. I also believe that number should take into account the age and developmental stage of the students, and subject being taught. I especially appreciate the one teacher's comments to the author's poll about class size where she says \"But the trade-off with twenty-four is that it verges on having the energetic mass of an audience instead of a team.\" I think the idea of a class room of kids functioning as a team is well worth embracing.\n\nThe example of the extremely wealthy Hollywood parent (Section 3) would have been more effective in the context of Emil \"Jay\" Freireich in chapter five. Both men grew up without any kind of privilege. Gladwell tells us about Dr. Freireich's wife, but makes no mention of any children they may have had. If he did have children, how did they turn out? Did he have similar parenting difficulties to the wealthy Hollywood parent? A top cancer doctor must have made a very comfortable living. And for the handful of people who had awful childhoods and were able to make something of their lives, there are millions more who didn't.\n\nIn chapter three Gladwell introduces us to Miss Sacks. In her case the problem was NEITHER pond. The problem was the fish herself. Miss Sacks skated through her pre-college years making As. She was clearly gifted. She fell victim to most prevalent myth about the gifted, \"they're gifted, they'll be fine...the cream always rises to the top\". Gifted kids who are not challenged during their formative years will crumble when faced with adversity later in life. The adversity she faced at Brown would be a very welcome problem to many, many other people. \"I had never gotten a B in an academic context before.\" Most people would have been thrilled with a B in organic chemistry. This class wasn't required for her major, but she couldn't handle the idea of a B on her record and she ran away. How is she going to handle a disagreeable boss who doesn't care where she went to school, but demands her work be done by a specified time? How is she going to deal with marriage? Children? Life?\n\n\"I figured, regardless of how much I prepared...\" That's the problem, she wasn't prepared. Her comments about her classmates show she wasn't prepared for the change in culture from a public high school with supportive parents on hand to a competitive, stand on your own two feet environment. Because of this it is doubtful she would have a greatly different experience in ANY pond. I have attended BOTH a small private college and a large state university. Each presented their own unique set of challenges. I am not convinced in any way that Miss Sacks would have done any better at the University of Maryland. There are challenges in every pond.\n\nAnd Mr. Gladwell left her story incomplete. He never states if she left Brown or not. If she did, where did she go? If she stayed, what major did she end up with? There is no information specifically about her in the notes for that chapter.\n\nAs a parent of both gifted and twice exceptional kids, I have experienced and researched a lot about gifted education and testing. Miss Sacks probably aced every achievement and I.Q. test she was ever given. When that happens the appropriate response is to continue testing with higher and higher levels of tests until the student no longer hits the test ceiling. THAT is a true measure of ability. If an 8 year old maxes out a test designed for 8 year olds then you give the same 8 year old a test for 10 year olds, 12 year olds, etc until that 8 year old no longer has perfect scores. Unfortunately this rarely happens. For some reason we also confuse academic ability with social and emotional ability in our educational system. Miss Sacks is an example of how gifted kids are underserved or even out right neglected in most education settings. And her parents bear some responsibility here as well. Although they will probably have to support her for some time to come.\n\nI highly recommend you read everything you can about the gifted at www.hoagiesgifted.org or join their FaceBook group. There is also good research at http://pty.vanderbilt.edu/research/question4/. The Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University is also a good resource. www.cty.jhu.edu.\n\nIn chapter four Gladwell introduces readers to the concept of \"desirable difficulties\". No, I wouldn't wish Dyslexia on my child, or any other developmental disability or learning disability Mr. Gladwell!! Dyslexia is NOT \"a neurological malfunction\"(p. 115), it is a different method of brain function. As the mother of a child on the Autism spectrum I found this chapter particularly offensive. I am friends with other parents who have children who are ADHD, Dyslexic, and have unique genetic disorders with names most people would not recognize. NONE of these disorders are enjoyable. Not for the child afflicted and not for the parents.\n\nThe way Gladwell starts this chapter by asking \"You wouldn't wish dyslexia on your child? Or would you?\" and most of the chapter will lead some readers to believe that parents of children who are struggling with dyslexia and other issues are just a bunch of whining babies when we struggle to get our kids the services they so desperately need to survive in the world. It was only because of The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 forcing public schools to accommodate physically disabled children that physically handicapped children were ALLOWED to attend public schools. That law eventually became the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act of 2004, also known as IDEA, which expanded services to children with developmental and learning disabilities as well. Without this federal law these services would not exist in public schools. Even with this law many public schools do everything they can to deny services to kids who need them.\n\nI completely understand why Gary Cohn's mother was a fountain of tears when he graduated high school. What I don't understand is why he didn't have any kind of help with this and David Boies didn't have either a diagnosis or any kind of help since Dyslexia has been a known condition since 1887. It was first known as word blindness, or strephosymbolia. The term dyslexia wasn't in common usage until the 1970s. Two researchers, Dr. Samuel T. Orton and Anna Gillingham, developed a system to teach dyslexics how to read in 1935. It is known as the Orton-Gillingham Approach. This system to teach dyslexics how to read has been around for more than 85 years. Unfortunately, this method is usually only available in specialized private schools. And while Dyslexia is covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) law (www.idea.ed.gov), some states are working very hard to relive themselves of a range of federal laws including the IDEA.\n\nThe war between the federal government and the red states are leaving casualties among our children who need the services provided for under the IDEA federal law that has existed in different reiterations since the 1970s [see The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975]. Even with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) most public school districts will only work to the bare minimum of what services are required and may be delivered by people who don't have any special knowledge of your child's condition or specific needs.\n\nTwo of my afore mentioned friends have sons with dyslexia. The first friend has a son who was having speech difficulties early on. She took him to be evaluated by the local public school specialist for speech issues. The evaluation consisted of the specialist letting him play with a box of legos for an hour. That was it. No actual clinical evaluation took place. Her son was later diagnosed with dyslexia by a private sector specialist. My friend and her husband were justifiably offended and decided to go into debt sending their son to an area private school that offers the Orton-Gillingham program rather than send their son to the local public school until he can read independently. They made a choice between their economic security and their son's need for specialized services. Part of the reason they made this decision is because the mother also has dyslexia and went through the public schools in another state fighting for assistance the whole way. Their story is not unique. This lack of services at all or lack of sufficient services forces parents to pay for services provided for under the IDEA law in the private sector. Parents who can't afford these services are stuck.\n\nThe second of these friends lives in a neighboring school district to the first friend. She also had to go to the private sector to get her son's dyslexia diagnosis. The state we live in does not recognize dyslexia as a disability, so his IEP doesn't say dyslexia, it says he has issues with reading comprehension. He is getting services for reading comprehension through the public school where he is taken from his regular classroom several times per week to work with the special education teacher and a computer based program. This mother did have speech and reading issues growing up, but never had a diagnosis. In spite of dyslexia being an issue covered by the IDEA law, it was necessary to fudge the paperwork to meet state guidelines to get her son the help he needed.\n\nAs for myself, I have a son on the Autism spectrum. It is mind boggling how much time we have had to spend educating the educators on his specific needs and abilities. He also has an IEP. It has taken all of our free time to educate ourselves on his needs and lots and lots of meetings for amending/rewriting his IEP to define the services he needs as well as following up with staff to make sure those services are actually performed. Any parent with a child on an IEP needs to follow one simple rule: trust AND verify. Trust the appropriate staff to deliver services, but verify by checking up on them to make sure they actually are doing their jobs. The IDEA law is a valuable and necessary thing for kids with learning and/or developmental issues. The implementation of it varies greatly between school districts.\n\nIt would have been a good idea to have mentioned the degree Gary Cohn earned from American University was a B.S. in Finance. He also stated in his commencement speech to the class of 2009 at American University \"What I did have, I had passion. I had enormous passion. I had passion for financial markets. I had fallen in love with financial markets.\" [http://www.american.edu/media/20090510_Kogod_School_of_Business_Speaker.cfm] These things put him in a MUCH better position to get the job at Goldman Sachs than you lead readers to believe. He only worked for United States Steel for five months.\n\nDavid Boies isn't the only Dyslexic lawyer around. In the 1950s Peter Wright was diagnosed in elementary school with strephosymbolia. His parents managed to find a tutor who taught him how to read. He also has dysgraphia and ADHD. He became a successful lawyer devoted to education issues for students with disabilities. You can read more about him at www.wrightslaw.com/us.htm.\n\nI highly recommend you read this book to learn more about dyslexia and others with visual spatial abilities: In the Mind's Eye: Creative Visual Thinkers, Gifted Dyslexics, and the Rise of Visual Technologies by Thomas G. West.\n\nGladwell states correctly in chapter five \"The right question is whether we as a society need people who have emerged from some kind of trauma - and the answer is we plainly do.\" This would have been a much better conclusion for the whole book. I find it odd that the author did not write any form of a conclusion at all for the book. Just try getting a paper without a conclusion past any high school English teacher.\n\nChapter seven features Rosemary Lawlor and her experiences of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. To clarify his point about the blunder the British made in their calculations about the general public obeying their authority Gladwell takes us to not one, but two classrooms. The topic at hand is NOT education, but he takes readers to a classroom to make his point about illegitimate authority. I agree with the Principle of Legitimacy as the author present it here. In my opinion this is one of the best made points in the whole book.\n\nAnd a side note for chapter nine - The Vichy region of France, specifically Tulle, also harbored a notable Jew during the German occupation. His name is Benoit Mandelbrot. He is the person who discovered the Mandelbrot Set which became the foundation for fractal geometry.\n\nI highly recommend you read Mr. Mandelbrot's autobiography: The Fractalist, Memoir of a Scientific Maverick by Benoit B. Mandelbrot.\n\nThis book is a hodge-podge of poorly presented and poorly researched hits and misses without even so much as a simple conclusion. I have not read any of Gladwell's other books. After reading this book I have no motivation to read the others. Gladwell might try taking this book and rearranging it to focus solely on education.",
    "A lot to process after reading this book. The references are relevant but mostly about groups of people seeking equality in their many aspects of life.\n\nThe stories are inspiring. The earlier chapters bring out the success of people/leaders who struggled with their learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. Yet, they changed the facet of their environment to their advantage. These are good motivating developments.\n\nI would like to know the struggles or the learning opportunities that these people had that led them to success. Did David learn how to kill with a staff and sling from a Sifu? How long did David take to learn that?",
    "I have never read any Gladwell books but, after hearing him interviewed on the radio, thought he sounded interesting and thus would give one of his books a try. I really enjoyed it. It was easy to read and, at least on my part, made me rethink things that I'd always accepted; 'Well, of course that has to be right' - but does it? Was it, necessarily, a great surprise that a small, well trained protector of livestock would loose a battle against a weak, poorly sighted acromegalic? Does the smaller class increase the productivity of students exponentially? Do some 'disabilities' actually increasing some people's ability and success? Whether you accept all the facts Gladwell pulls on in his book or not I'm quite sure that it will make you think about things - it did for me anyway.",
    "I'm a big fan of Gladwell especially his short stories and articles in The New Yorker. David and Goliath is a compelling analogy for the world in which we live today and had the making of a great book but I feel Gladwell fell short of the book's (and the point he set out to prove) true potential.\n\nThe premise that the small can take on the big and mighty and win in today's fast paced and rapidly changing world is compelling. But his book fails to inspire and that is a disappointment. The premise had been well laid out early in the book and I expected it to progress to great current day learnings but the entire book labours a point that most readers will get and agree with early on. Gladwell would then have done better to show the learnings and pitfalls of the analogy rather than spending chapter after chapter proving a point that had already been proven.\n\nSome good stories, well written and easy to read but could've delivered so much more. A decent book but from Gladwell I expected something more.\n\n3 1/2 stars.",
    "This is very enjoyable and entertaining reading. The main theme is the goldiocks principle - too little or too much of something won't work well - it needs to be just right ( or at least within a just-right range)\n\nDrawing on examples from education, policing, civil rights, and much else the book provides numerous anecdotes as well as statistical evidence to show that inverse U shaped curves apply to the effectiveness of most fields of human activity.\n\nI thouroughly enjoyed this book, although there is not much that is revelatory, and read it in just one day",
    "Malcolm rarely disappoints, some wonderful anecdotes, brilliant references to the bible. An absolutely first class read and instruction manual for anyone male or female, any team, any department, any nation who need to fight on principles against the \"big\".\n\nI particularly loved the description of the David and Goliath story, it was told so vividly, I could see it in my minds eye, it made sense and created a series of paradigm shifts in my head regarding the way I have heard the story in the past.\n\nI will read this again and again, just like watching a good film, to spot the subtle nuggets I may have missed on my first reading."

    "When I first saw the title of the book I was intrigued. Then when I read the author's bio I saw that the author is a hedge fund manager who works from his yacht, anchored wherever he chooses to have it. I thought the contents of this book could not possibly be for me or 95% of the population. But I took a chance and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe author makes a good and yes even objective argument on how to maximize your experiences throughout life and at the same time keeping within a certain budget so that by life's end you're not dying with a tremendous excess or don't find yourself pennyless either. Mr. Perkins is able to juxtapose the average Joe with someone having unlimited wealth and show how both can live their lives rich in experiences and at the same time allowing themselves the security of not over or under spending their future.\n\nThe book is an easy read and if nothing else you will find yourself looking back on all your missed opportunities (mine are considerable), and rethinking how to capitalize on future endeavors.",
    "I am a financial advisor and I am going to give this book to all my clients. The philosophy is spot on. I bought the Audible version then bought the paperback for my wife to read. Read it Live it and you will be a happier person because of it!",

    "I am a financial advisor, and started sending this book to some of my clients. It is not for everyone, however, for the millions of people who over-save, and overwork themselves, it is invaluable. I am not exaggerating when I say it has completely changed a couple of my clients’ lives. If you are somebody who rationally knows you could be getting more out of life, but the fear of running out of money gets in your way, this book is a must read.",
    "I’m enjoying this book by Bill Perkins! Have you read it yet?\n\nIt’s a completely untraditional, but refreshing and thought provoking path for life.\n\nWhat’s stuck out the most for me?\n\n1) experience/memory dividends— invest in experiences and memories early and you can withdraw and enjoy them from memory for years to come.\n\n2) sort of morbid, but run mortality data on yourself (I ran four and the consensus is I’ll live to 98) this helps you plan your life and your expenses— the data shows that we spend less each decade after 40… even though our net worth is going up. See #1 live your life now!!\n\nGive it a read!",
    "This book really makes you realize, start now, don’t wait! All the excuses Bill describes are so true, just a little more, don’t take that day off, maybe next month, put off that trip till next year. Been there, done that, time to start enjoying more!",
    "Kind of repetitive which made me have a little bit of difficulty finishing the book. I manage to somehow finish reading it though. The book has fresh great ideas, different from what we normally hear from financial advisors which I have not considered in the past. It somewhat shifted my idea about saving and spending, but not completely, since I am still fairly young and in the process of generating wealth. I bought it on sale and the purchase is well worth it.",
    "The concept of the book is great however it effectively repeats the same idea throughout and thus feel it doesn't warrant the price nor does it need to be so long as could easily have been covered in just a few pages.",
    "Simply amazing book. It changed my whole concept about money to the extent that I am a lot more relaxed about money and enjoying life a lot more doing things I always wanted to. I would recommend it highly.",
    "The book makes many points that could cause us to shift our way of thinking about money in a positive manner, however I feel the book is repetitive and could have been shortened to make the same points.",
    "This book will be appreciated by open-minded people but needs to be read by the close-minded among us. It gives a different perspective on the traditional attitude to money i.e save when you're young to spend when your old. Well worth a read.",
    "I didn’t agree with everything but thought it was a brilliantly provocative book, challenging me to live life more intentionally… the sections on remembering you can o ly do certain things at certain ages were very compelling\nGreat reminder that life is not about hoarding!!"

    "This is a well-researched nonfiction book about how the Sackler family of the privately-held company Purdue Pharma, their sales reps, unethical and misinformed doctors, our pitiful healthcare system that only helps some people, and our misguided law enforcement and incarceration laws created an opioid crisis that became a heroin crisis that led to overdosing becoming the leading cause of death for young Americans.\n\nOur country needs to ensure that everyone has access to healthcare, including mental health and substance abuse care. We also need to change our drug laws so tax payers aren’t funding prisons for people who are low-level drug users. It costs a minimum of thirty-thousand dollars a year to incarcerate someone. In states like New York and California, the cost is seventy- to more than one-hundred grand. What if we used that money on healthcare and education and substance abuse treatment?\n\nAccording to Macy’s book, “Rehab is . . . a multibillion-dollar lie.” It’s unevenly regulated and largely abstinence-focused, meaning people who are trying to get weaned off opioids aren’t supposed to take drugs like Suboxone, even though it’s proven to help dramatically in keeping people off drugs. Most rehab centers, which are unaffordable to many, are abstinence, faith-based 12-step programs (5 of the 12 steps refer to a Higher Power) even though for opioid abuse, there is significant evidences that medication-assisted treated for the long term is a more reliable solution for sobriety.\n\n“When you spend that much money, you think it’s going to work. But it’s killing people for that myth to be out there—that the only true cure is abstinence.”\n\nNot to mention, even for people who might be able to afford (barely) incare treatment, there aren’t nearly enough beds in residential treatment centers to meet the demand.\n\n“The most important thing for the morphine-hijacked brain is, always, not to experience the crushing physical and psychological pain of withdrawal: to avoid dopesickness at any cost. To feed their addictions, many users recruit new customers. Who eventually recruit new customers. And the exponential growth continues until the cycle too often ends in jail or prison . . . a grave.”\n\nIn terms of the opioid crisis, by now we know it’s a national problem that begin in small towns, places like Appalachia that were one-industry towns. When coal-mining stopped being lucrative because of alternate sources of energy like fracking and wind turbines, there were no more jobs. People often had on-the-job injuries and were overprescribed opioids. A drug that should only be used for end-of-life care or cancer, people were getting hooked after just two weeks and then ultimately turned to the cheaper heroin. Four of five people heroin addicts now come to the drug by originally being prescribed opioids.\n\nWhat’s the difference between our schwag and other sales reps? Asked a representative for Purdue Pharma, the company that hooked our citizens on Oxycontin. The Sacklers that own Purdue are one of the richest families in America. The difference is that “People aren’t stealing from their families or breaking into their neighbors’ homes over blood-pressure pills,” said small-town Dr. Van Zee, a major voice to change how this drug is prescribed, which took years. “Doctors started prostituting themselves for a few free trips to Florida,” said lawyer Emmitt Yeary, who represented the families of people who committed Oxy-related crimes (stealing copper from buildings to get another fix, for example).\n\n“We know from other countries that when people stick with treatment, outcomes can bet better than fifty percent. But people in the United States don’t have access to good opioid-addiction treatment.”\n\nThe state of Virginia, where many of the stories from both sides of the law that Macy reports on, is one of the states that refused to accept Medicaid expansion in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, sacrificing $6.6 million a day in federal funds for insurance coverage. “In states where Medicaid expansions were passed, the safety-net program had become the most important epidemic-fighting tool, paying for treatment, counseling, and addiction medications and filling other long-standing gaps in care. It gave coverage to an additional 1.3 million addicted users who were not poor enough for Medicaid but too poor for private insurance.” “ If only (politicians) understood that Medicaid would actually save money and lives!”\n\n“It takes about eight years on average, after people start treatment, to get one year of sobriety . . . and four or five different episodes of treatment for that sobriety to stick.”\n\nBecause I’m passionate about healthcare reform, justice reform, and an end to people’s lives getting ruined because they had some injury and became addicted to strong opioids almost overnight, I really enjoyed this book and highlighted many, many pages. We need to treat people with addictions with respect because addiction is not a moral failing of not having enough willpower, it’s about how addicted brains work differently than nonaddicted brains.",
    "Beth Macy is a marvel to me for she may be the best reporter to what has happens to the core of this country in the period of the last decade of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st; she had the fortune to be where it was happening and the journalistic ability to tell the story.\n\nHer first publication Factory Man captures a blow by blow account of the collapse of furniture factories and surrounding garment trades in Appalachian as globalization begins in the 1990’s and workers who had know employment in a region of declining Coal production watch as their employers ship their businesses south of the border to Mexico or off to China and are pleased selling imports free of local labor cost. Macy could see the related collapse of the service industries, retail sales and social fabric of the towns, unemployment rates rose to above 20 percent, food stamp claims more than tripled, and disability rates went up 60.4 percent; but she has a hero.\nHer hero was John D. Bassett III, and that is a story well told; a man who saves most of his family firm and reorganizes the resistance to Asian ‘dumping’ winning compensation that enabled many to survive and restructure their trade despite resistance from all who were finding Chinese wiser and profitable.*\nBut in this story Bassett’s factory is mentioned as a building being stripped for copper wire and burned by an individual carelessly seeking something to recycle. The area is an economic disaster but a market for an opiate to relieve pain. Do you remember your doctor or nurse asking your pain level ‘one to ten’?\n“The 1996 introduction of OxyContin coincided with the moment in medical history when doctors, hospitals, and accreditation boards were adopting the notion of pain as “the fifth vital sign,” developing new standards for pain assessment and treatment that gave pain equal status with blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.” (p. 27).\n\nMacy takes the now well known opiate addiction resulting from OxyContin and other medications and moves it from ‘those poor hillbillies of Appalachian’ to the children of doctors, lawyers, and insurance salesmen of the middle class and their addiction and often deaths.\nAppalachia was among the first places where the malaise of opioid pills hit the nation in the mid-1990s, ensnaring coal miners, loggers, furniture makers, and their kids.\n“Two decades after the epidemic erupted, Princeton researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton were the first economists to sound the alarm. Their bombshell analysis in December 2015 showed that mortality rates among white Americans had quietly raised a half-percent annually between the years 1999 and 2013 while midlife mortality continued to fall in other affluent countries. “Half a million people are dead who should not be dead,” the Washington Post, blaming the surge on suicides, alcohol-related liver disease, and drug poisonings—predominantly opioids—which the economists later referred to as “diseases of despair.” (p. 16).\n\nMacy shows that the real despair was the inability to achieve a release from addiction in the world of pills, then heroin, and finally chemically altered heroin flooding America’s landscape.\n\nHere again she has heroes the well informed who see addiction not as a crime but a sickness needing careful monitoring and public funding; a unifying of enforcement and public health –a national emergency.\nDopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company that Addicted America is Beth Macy’s call for solutions. As she mentions even Trump has recognized the problem but has not moved toward solution. A recent article in the Times post-election recommends that the Democrats need to capture rural America for 2020 and dealing with opiate addiction highly recommended. If the nation is ready Beth Macy and ‘angels’ she covers are sources for direction.\nA slow presentation but possessing the very humanistic qualities she excels at.\n5 Stars\n*John Bassett did what any employer who wish to save his business could have done, and that was using the rules of competition embedded in the W.T.O. to test Chinese subsidized production and under pricing cost of production. He won compensation from his China competitor allowed under the system and survived (for a while?).",
    "Watched the show, bought the book.  I already knew the story beforehand, because I lived it.  I'm from Kentucky and witnessed firsthand the explosion of OxyContin in the mid 2000s, followed by the Florida pill mills, and eventually heroin.  I and many of my closest friends struggled for years with opiate addiction.  I still remember the first time I tried it, the first time I shot it, and the last time I used.. March 28, 2012.  Suboxone saved my life.  I went through multiple rehab stints, NA, AA, inpatient, outpatient, nothing worked until Suboxone and today I can say I now have a college degree, 2 kids of my own, and am a productive member of society.  There were hundreds of people I saw on a regular basis during my using days.  I can count on one hand how many are alive, clean, and not in jail or prison today.  This story is hard to digest because it takes me back and reminds me of those that lost the battle.  Many of the closest friends I've ever had.  Some had years of clean time and one relapse they were gone, others struggled for years and never found a way out, some mothers, some fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, all just in our group of friends.  I just wanted to review mainly to post their names, even though you don't know them, I'll never forget them.  The FDA members responsible and Sacklers belong in prison and can rott in hell.\n\nLivi Getty\nConnor McComas\nIan McComas\nWelles Bradley\nLynsay Oram\nJonathan Fightmaster\nMegan Mattingly\nNick Handy\nDerrick Kiser\nScotty Abbott",
    "I highly recommend this book, it is a look at the seedy side of drug company's and greed!!!\nI listened in the car and did not want to get out to go to work before I heard the full chapter",
    "Where do I begin with this?\n\nFirstly, I think myself very lucky to live in England with a National Health Service that has looked after us all since day one. The events in this book are incredibly heartbreaking to read and it must have been a mammoth task in itself just to commit tragedy after tragedy to print.\n\nThis book details the phenomenal rise in opioid painkillers and the abuse of the system by reps, gps and patients alike. The history detailing opium in its many forms is enlightening and gives an insight into how easy it has always been to obtain in the USA.\nThere are no punches pulled in the waves of grieving parents when overdose after overdose occurs so frequently that it almost becomes the norm. Gone are the stereotypes of the 'typical junkie' when the affluent neighbourhoods are flooded with Oxycontin and Heroin as the drugs of choice, and normal life is forever destroyed.\nA typical extract from the book stood out as particularly harrowing when a family were checking up on their daughter who had not been in touch. Upon entering the house she was found dead on her bed from an overdose with her baby cooing on the bed beside her...\nI cannot begin to imagine how difficult this must have been to write this having had to stop reading on multiple occasions due to the intense pain that comes across in this text. The author has been very fair in portraying the victims as human beings with feelings as everybody else, and the detailing of the families and communities tirelessly battling to get addiction recognised as an illness rather than be stigmatised is very well done. I can't praise this book enough for how well this has been put together and would recommend this to anybody interested in the subject of drugs and addiction - regardless of where you are from.",
    "Until reading this book, I was somewhat aware of the drug problem that is rampant in the United States. Mostly, however, this awareness centred on the use of cocaine and crack cocaine.\nBut what I hadn't been aware of was the devastation caused by the use of opioids, kicked off by the over-prescription of pain-killers. The death rate resulting from use of these drugs matches death rates from war.\nBeth Macy paints a harrowing picture of folk in the grip of these drugs.\nOne fact that emerged from the tale that made a worthwhile comment on recent news was that legalising the use of marijuana created another problem. Drug dealers who had relied on an income from selling marijuana were forced to change to selling alternative drugs, - including opioids. Quite thought provoking.\nAt times the book tended to be a bit over-long, and I found myself speed reading over sections.\nAll-in-all, though, this book is well worth having on ones bookshelf, and it tells a grim but readable modern tale.",
    "It's hard to recommend a book like this but I do. The forensic dissection of the opioid crisis, woven through the lives of it's victims in rural America, is heart breaking. But this won't go away without understanding and Macy paints such a clear, factual picture.\nNot a light read but a very good one.",
    "I am finding it hard to finish this book because the story is so bleak and distressing. No one comes out of it with their reputations in tact. The Sackler's company Purdue Pharma pushed the overprescribing of opiates aided by many in the medical profession. Politicians did not act because the people initially involved were poorly educated and marginalised. It is a must read but don't expect to enjoy it!",
    "This was a great if slow read. Beth Macy gives a deeply personal look at the impact of the opioid crisis. Telling the story of victims, their families and those fighting to save them it is a harrowing read"

    "In 1986, W. Edwards Deming introduced his “14 Points for Management” in the book, Out of the Crisis. Here is number eight.\n\n“Whether fear of failure, fear of reprisals or fear of management, fear is unhelpful to the success of your business. Drive out fear by encouraging communication, respect and teamwork at all levels of your business.”\n\nThat was good advice, but there wasn’t much guidance on how to drive out fear or how your workplace might function when you did. Amy Edmonson’s The Fearless Organization gives you a mental model, so you know what an organization looks like after you follow Dr. Deming’s advice to “Drive out fear.”\n\nI’ve read a lot about “psychological safety” in the past several years, including several articles by Dr. Edmondson. Since she coined the term, many other people have used it. I bought this book to go to the source and find out what Dr. Edmondson had to say.\n\nShe describes her goal for the book in the Introduction. She wants to “equip you with some new ideas and practices to make knowledge-intensive organizations work better.” She defines the fearless organization this way.\n\n“The fearless organization is one in which interpersonal fear is minimized so that team and organizational performance can be maximized in a knowledge intensive world.”\n\nThe Fearless Organization is divided into three parts. Part I is, “the power of psychological safety.” Chapter two is an excellent summary of the research. If you’re interested in going into more depth about psychological safety, this chapter is worth the price of the book. In addition to this chapter on research, Dr. Edmondson includes detailed notes and references at the end of every chapter. Minor these at your pleasure.\n\nPart II is “Psychological Safety at Work.” Chapters three and four give you real-world examples of organizations without psychological safety. You’ll recognize most of them. Chapters five and six share examples of organizations with psychological safety. You may be surprised at some of them. You will see a strong contrast between the two groups in terms of organizational life and productivity.\n\nPare III is “Creating a Fearless Organization.” Chapter seven provides a toolkit for leaders. The tools fall into three buckets. They are, setting the stage, inviting participation, and responding productively. If you want to follow Dr. Deming’s advice to drive out fear, here’s how.\n\nChapter eight is titled, “What Next.” It includes an excellent section on the questions Dr. Edmondson is frequently asked about psychological safety.\n\nThis is an excellent book, whether you’re investigating psychological safety as an intellectual exercise or seeking some help in improving psychological safety where you work. The big insight for me was that psychological safety deals with interpersonal fear and is an emergent property of a group. I had the basic concepts, but now I have deeper insights and language to express them.\n\nThis is a good, helpful package of important ideas. But they may not seem new to you. You probably know that it’s not a good idea to shoot messengers who bring bad news. You may understand your job as creating an environment where both productivity and morale are high. Don’t pass up this book on that account.\n\nFirst, no matter how much you know, you can learn something here about psychological safety., Just knowing isn’t enough. As my friend Rod Santomassimo likes to say, “Don’t KID yourself, knowing isn’t doing.” This book can be a powerful tool to improve the work and morale of any team. But that won’t happen if all you do is read about psychological safety.\n\nIn a Nutshell\n\nThe Fearless Organization demonstrates what psychological safety is, why it’s important, and how to make it happen where you work. If you’re responsible for the performance of the group, put this book on your must-read list.",
    "Edmondson’s The Fearless Organization provides a useful framework for managers who are interested in promoting psychological safety in their work environments. For more seasoned managers or those with high emotional intelligence, the concepts presented in the book are either elementary or mere common sense. The book includes numerous case studies that depict problems resulting from work environments that are not psychologically safe; several cases even led to death. Fostering collaboration and sharing opinions in the workplace, therefore, are imperative. While these cases generally illustrate the principles well, it would have been helpful to read more examples of psychological safety from traditional industries where creativity is less crucial. Case studies aside, much of the chapters’ content is repetitive and one might simply skip to the end of each chapter and read the useful “takeaways” to get the gist of it.\n\nOne refreshing aspect of Edmondson’s framework is that it is backed by 20 years of research in multiple industries. This research shows the importance of psychological safety in the workplace: when employees do not feel enabled or encouraged to speak up with their questions or concerns, it can breed a culture of silence which may go beyond business failure and affect people’s physical and mental health. The book does a good job of highlighting the fact that a lack of psychological safety is not just attributed to poorly performing companies with overly assertive and intimidating managers, but can affect well performing businesses with proven track records and family-oriented cultures. In my own experience, which is paralleled in the book, this lack of psychological safety is derived from a false belief system that management is so good at what they do that employees don't challenge them, resulting in a dangerous silence.\n\nEdmondson offers several useful tools in this book. The first is a survey managers can administer to gauge how psychologically safe their teams feel. Edmondson also includes all of her research references at the end of each chapter, which are helpful for those wanting to learn more about psychological safety and related concepts. The leader’s toolkit and self-assessment can be applied by managers to any interaction with their employees.\n\nIf Edmondson’s goal, as she states, is to provide readers with “new ideas and practices to make knowledge-intensive organizations work better,” this book is best poised for the new manager as an introduction to the concepts of psychological safety. One can take away a sense of their own psychological environments and have the tools to ensure a safer workplace. It is probably not enough, however, for someone to merely apply the leader’s toolkit in working with their teams. Managers must build rapport and trust, which takes time, effort and practice. My overall advice to new managers when it comes to psychological safety: read this book as an introduction, use the leadership self-assessment and tool-kit often, and design creative “braintrust-like” activities suitable for team feedback and collaboration. My advice to Edmondson: pull the meat from this book to create an abbreviated handbook that includes the psychological safety survey, leader’s toolkit, and leadership self-assessment, and you’ll have a best-seller.",
    "Lectura súper recomendada. Maravilloso!!!\nAquí una de las claves fundamentales para que los procesos de cambio sean exitosos y fluidos",
    "Book arrived within promised time and in good condition.",
    "“A Fearless Organization” paired very well with “5 Dysfunctions of a Team”. The author uses an evidence-based approach to define & describe simple key strategies to transform communication, team effectiveness & satisfaction. These few keys support the pillars described in Lencioni’s pyramid of a functioning team. I’ve read several other books on teams, leadership, &/or communication that, IMO, are excessively redundant, overly complicated & wordy w/too many steps, or focused too narrowly (e.g. on a certain group of people or a specific trait like empathy).",
    "It doesn’t matter how well you are performing as an organization, you can raise the bar by practicing psychological safety. Create a culture that leads to efficiency, greater productivity and value.\n\nThank you for this read. I will be putting many of these things into practice.",
    "Superficial 200-word ‘cases’, with no depth or insider perspective, cobbled together around quite general pointers. Exceptionally important topic but content could be condensed into a blog post with little or no loss of meaning.\n\nDeep familiarity with a few of the cases suggests a substantial misreading of what was really going on, with trends that often reversed themselves within a few years.\n\nOverall impression is that author uncritically reproduces executive talking points on what they did, without (ironically) investigating other stakeholders’ experiences.",
    "I work in an organisation that thinks it values everyone, and aims to have an open and honest culture, but there's variability in how that gets implemented and there are still knee-jerk threats made about \"if anyone does that again, they'll be...\" So even in a relatively mature organisation with a generally good safety culture, and good intentions, there is still lots for each individual to understand about the impacts and implications of what they say and do.\nI'm lucky in that at least my organisation and industry know where they ought to be heading, there are others where the philosophy in this book will be completely eye-opening. Read it, use it and share it.",
    "This book is absolutely outstanding. Time after time, the examples give deep insight into the perils of fear-based, command and control cultures that can bring down an organisation. But this isn't just a list of examples good and bad. The author builds a model and a toolkit guide - explaining how to implement a culture of psychological safety in which people speak up. If you ever worry whether people are telling you what's really going on - this is the help you need. I would give it 6 stars if allowed.",
    "I am an owner of a company, and school principal, and wanted to learn more about organisational psychology, and to understand HR better than I do. It's an easily read book, and the author develops and maintains interest is through reference to real life examples of workplace and corporate practice in the vein of 'The Innovator's Dilemma''. It's not one of those 'Can't put down' books (which, along with being a little repetitive, is why I gave it 4 stars not 5), but for a layperson, not formally read in psychology, and interested in either making your company work, or understanding the toxic environment you may be working in (read bullying), then this is certainly a very worthwhile read.",
    "A great book on organisational psychology that is laid out in 2 parts.\n\nThe first part is all about the problems that can surface if people feel unable to speak up in organisations.\n\nThe second part describes some solutions that can be put in place to overcome these problems. And this creates what the author describes as a ‘fearless organisation’\n\nI really enjoyed this and will use some of the learnings in my own work"

    "Opened my eye towards the tax system and how we are progressing. Why it is important to have tax free retirement or how to lower our taxes when we have no income. How you can gain from LIRP etc.",
    "I was hesitant on buying this book after being recommended by a good friend, because I thought I was too young for the topic (48). I was so wrong.\nThis book helped me understand how I save for retirement NOW, can effect how much I am taxed on my retirement income and social security (crazy).\nI recommend this book to anyone looking to live past 60 years old, and looking to live the same or slightly better lifestyle when they retire.",
    "I found that this book did a great job educating on how to empower my future and understand how to maximize my retirement, as well as other ways to supplement and enhance it. It's definitely worth reading as it's a real eye opener in these times!!!",
    "I have very mixed feelings about this book. Among the things I really like are (1) it's emphasis upon the importance of tax planning as an important part of retirement planning, and (2) concrete examples of how tax planning is performed that demonstrate the complexities involved.\n\nOn the negative side, this book is premised upon a misleading assertion, one that any good undergraduate textbook on taxes and tax planning warns every student against. Simply put, the goal of tax planning isn't to reduce or even eliminate taxes, rather it is to maximize the after-tax funds available for spending. From this perspective investment fees are just as bad as taxes, since both reduce what's available for spending. Certainly reducing taxes is an important tool to the achieve the ultimate goal. But reducing taxes while at the same time letting investment fees leap up (i.e. fees associated with life insurance policies) isn't usually the best route to maximize spending over the course of retirement.\n\nThe uninformed reader of this book would certainly come away with the impression that life insurance is as good or better than a Roth IRA as a mechanism for maximizing spending funds over retirement. This is decidedly false. It's not that hard to set up Roth IRAs with no annual fees and investments that amount to 0.10% or less on an annual basis. All-in fees for life insurance policies are 10-20 times larger. If you want a simple guide to minimizing Roth investment fees, search here on the Amazon website for \"Investing made Simple\" by Mike Piper.\n\nI was also disappointed that through most of the book the author referred to LIRP's as having tax-free distributions, making them comparable to Roth IRAs in this regard. It isn't until the last chapter of the book that that actual tax-deferred nature of LIRP distributions is revealed, along with the \"work around\" of taking loans from the insurance company to avoid taxes. Of course as a financial educator I already knew this. So I can only describe as \"extremely misleading\" that this key fact isn't honestly stated earlier in the \"LIRP Chapter\". And in spite of the authors strong suggestion that such loans will cost you nothing, don't believe it. If the insurance company doesn't charge an explicit annual interest fee for the loan, they will get that money from you via implicitly higher administration and mortality charges. There are NO truly free loans!\n\nWith all the discussion about Roth IRAs I found it suspicious that Roth Accounts weren't mentioned. Most 401(k), 403(b) and public 457(b) plans now incorporate a Roth Account. This feature allows workers to aside quite large amounts of after-tax dollars for tax-free spending in retirement. For 2019 up to $19,000 could be set aside in a Roth Account, plus another $6,000 for those age 50 or older. And people can continue to set aside money in their own Roth IRAs on top of their workplace savings! Of course all this Roth Account / Roth IRA saving wouldn't leave money for paying life insurance premiums, and I suspect that's the reason this detail wasn't mentioned!\n\nFinally, the question of exactly how high taxes will rise in the future is a difficult one to answer. I agree with the author that, at least for upper income people, tax brackets will rise and deductions will shrink. Many politicians are even seriously considering a Wealth Tax, which could seriously rearrange many people's tax planning strategies. But unlike the author, I don't expect that the existing 10% or 12% tax brackets will rise above 15%. Normally even those tax brackets would lead to some Social Security taxation. But a portion of the SECURE act that has passed the U.S. House contains a provision for drastically increasing the income allowed before Social Security income starts to become taxable. Thus becoming too aggressive in paying higher taxes now in a rush to attain no income taxes in retirement may well lead to lower total spending in retirement than a more modest approach.\n\nA very intriguing paragraph in the book occurs on page 11 where the author takes us back to the 1960 - 1963 time frame when the lowest marginal tax bracket was 20% and the highest was 91%. Those brackets sound scary, but the calculation of income tax isn't always straightforward. For retirees at that time there was a \"retirement income tax credit\" in existence that was quite substantial. When the tax system for 1963 is converted into 2019 dollars, a 65 year old retired couple would need to have had over $150,000 of income to even begin to pay federal taxes. If only we had such low taxes today! And the reference to 94% tax bracket on income above $200,000 in 1943? In 2019 dollars, that becomes about $3 million.",
    "My big takeaway from this book has been that one’s situation may not allow literally getting to zero taxes, but they can still do a lot of optimizing to keep as much as possible of their hard earned nest egg. For those who start on this path further away from retirement, it’ll be the most directly useful, but even if that day is right around the corner there’s still good info.",
    "There’s no way the average consumer can understand a LIRP. They are way too complex and convoluted so you can’t determine the true costs. That’s why insurance salesmen have to SELL it to you. His taxable bucket strategy doesn’t even discuss the HUGE tax advantages of long term capital gains. Probably because it competes with his LIRP he wants to sell you. I’ll give you the choice of following this “expert” or Warren Buffet. Warren says put your money in a passive S&P 500 index ETF and don’t take it out until you need it decades later for retirement. Even though we do this in a taxable account all gains are deferred just like a traditional IRA, but ONLY the gains are taxable when you take it out. Remember that taxable accounts also have no contribution limits, no RMDs, no 59 1/2 penalty, you can harvest tax losses, you can sell via tax lots. Since this “expert” gets to cherrypick his tax situations I will do the same. Invest your money in a taxable S&P 500 index ETF like Vanguard VOO which has an expense ratio of .04% which is almost 38 times less than the “experts” 1.5% fee for his LIRP. Over decades and using compounding this alone will result in HUGE savings. Do NOT use a mutual fund because they distribute capital gains at the end of each year. Only use an ETF in your taxable account. Dividends from this ETF will be taxable each year, but they are only 1.85% and are qualified so they are taxed at 0% or 15% depending on your tax bracket. Here’s one example of how you avoid all the long term capital gains in this taxable account resulting in 0% tax rate. You retire at 62 and you don’t have any earnings. You defer taking Social Security until 70 resulting in maximum benefits. You live off your taxable account resulting in long term capital gains. You sell via tax lots so you can determine exactly the amount of your long term capital gains. If you file married filing jointly you can sell $101,200 worth of long term capital gains resulting in 0% tax rate! Notice I did not say you sell $101,200 worth of the ETF. You sell as much of the ETF via tax lot that results in$101,200 worth of long term capital gains. As an example $200,000 of the ETF may result in $101,200 of long term capital gains so in reality you will be selling $200,000 and not $101,200 of your ETF. This example assumes the only taxable income you have comes from this taxable account. At age 65 your standard deduction goes up by $1300 so if you both turn 65 you can do $103,800 of long term capital gains. Even if you exceed these amounts you will pay only 15% tax on the excess. Since Social Security convolutes your tax situation I highly recommend you do this before taking it.\nIf your ETF is worth $1,000,000 and it consists of $500,000 of long term capital gains you could do this for 5 years all at 0% tax rate! Should you sell $200,00 of your ETF even if you don’t need that much income for the year? YES! By doing so you will never pay taxes on those long term capital gains. Let’s say you don’t need any income for the year. You still sell $200,000 of the ETF so you can get 0% tax rate on $101,200 of long term capital gains and you immediately go out and buy $200,000 of the same ETF to continue deferring. This effectively raises your cost basis on this $200,000. Some will say what about the wash sale rule? That ONLY applies to losses not gains. If you doubt what I am saying then enter this tax information that I have presented into a 2018 tax software program and let it tell you the answer. I am sure you will trust it more than me.",

    "As I begin my review of “The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America’s Shining Women” by Kate Moore, it is almost difficult to harness my thoughts in an appropriate fashion. Perhaps to start I will say that this excellent documentary is a magnificent example of synchronicity – the idea that our Universe (or the Creator thereof) manages both Chronos and Kairos – “clock time” and “quantum time” in mysterious and marvelous ways.\n\nThe story of the women who painted luminous dials with radium paint in the 1920’s and thereafter is of course well-known. I remember my mother, who was an artist (but never a dial-painter) describing the horrific story of the radium poisoning that resulted because these workers had dipped their brushes in the radioactive paint and then “tipped” them with their lips. This was a “cautionary tale” as I began to be interested in painting myself; even non-radioactive paint could be poisonous. Although twirling the brush between the lips was an unsurpassed way of achieving a nice, sharp point, it could be hazardous to your health. Since my mother was beginning her art studies at the same time as the plight of the “Radium Girls” was big in the news, the story was doubtless pivotal for her.\n\nNow, a century later, this story is revenant! There are a number of other books recently published on this subject, and of course there is the 2020 movie. As I read this thoroughly annotated and magnificently written documentary, parallels to present-day concerns are glaringly obvious. Radium, recently (in 1902) isolated and studied by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre, was being touted as “the Miracle Element”. In less than 20 years, it was wildly commercialized, being advertised not only as “not dangerous”, but as a “universal cure”. It glowed in the dark, and minuscule amounts mixed with other materials produced a luminous paint that immediately became all the rage for watch and clock dials, as well as being extremely valuable for the “faces” of various scientific instruments. The painters hired to produce these various dials in the factories – called “studios” – in New Jersey and Illinois were universally “girls” – mostly young women in their teens and twenties. They had excellent hand-eye-coordination and could in fact accomplish the delicate painting at an amazing rate. Paid “by the piece”, the emphasis was all on speed, as well as frugality. It turned out that “lip-tipped” brushes were by far the cheapest and most efficient way of applying the paint.\n\nRadium is the chemical cousin of Calcium. As such, it turns out to be easily incorporated into bones, teeth, and other organs in the body where calcium uptake occurs. Radium-226, the predominant isotope, has a half-life of 1600 years, and is primarily an alpha-emitter, although other elements in the decay chain emit larger percentages of beta (high speed electrons) or gamma (short wavelength, high energy) electromagnetic radiation. Given this fact, it was assumed that the very slow emission of radiation was not harmful, especially because alpha rays (helium nuclei, very massive particles) are easily blocked by the skin or a sheet of paper. Sadly, as the book so vividly documents, this did not take into account that radium atoms incorporated into bone and other tissue emitted unblocked alpha bombardment directly to the cells themselves.\n\nBy the time the horrendous damage caused by “eating” the radium became obvious, which of course took several years while the element was consumed in accumulating amounts and then wrought its destruction, the dial companies were raking in the profits. They were prepared neither to impose precautions that might slow production, nor to compensate affected workers in a way that might harm their own “bottom line”. And so, once again, the Hydra-headed monster of corporate greed became the boon of company-supported lawyers and doctors and the bane of the unwitting women who were by then succumbing to the most horrific of illnesses – most specifically, deteriorating, honey-combed bones and raging sarcomas that formed and ruptured with lethal speed.\n\nThe real thrust of Moore’s documentary is the legal battles which the incredibly brave but tragically doomed women and their families waged, not only for their own survival during strait financial times (once radium poisoning set in, there was no cure, but treatment was extremely costly even if only palliative) but also to protect future workers who might be exploited by the unscrupulous profit-mongering of the “danger deniers” of the radium industry. I do not need to belabor the point about why this is a parable for the present day. The radium industry killed itself along with those who died hideous deaths because of denial, greed, and profiteering. There are present-day corporations rushing down that same path with ever-increasing velocity. It is up to private citizens, the press, and those who still have a conscience in the legal, medical, and business professions to call a halt. In other words, follow the science, not crass capitalism. Believe in cause and effect, and exercise compassion in place of exploitation.",
    "This is an extremely well written account of the lives of the women who helped to change working conditions with dangerous chemicals forever.\n\nThe vile and atrocious actions of Radium Dial, what they did to these girls, how they tortured and murdered these girls, is repulsive and sickening. How this was allowed to happen for so many years is incomprehensible.\n\nForced to pay their own medical bills for years, while their bodies were literally falling apart, many were driven into financial ruin. Not just the girls themselves, but also husbands and parents, who gave all they had to get treatment for the girls. Homes were lost to pay medical bills, while all along Radium Dial was telling them the paint was safe, while still working hundreds of girls dipping brushes into radium paint and into their mouths.\n\n\"For almost six years, Radium Dial had known the women were radioactive. Yet the knowledge of the discoveries had been carefully concealed by the firm, who feared disruption of their business if the facts became known…the victims had not been informed of their condition, nor the cause, through fear of panic among the workers.”\n\nThe lives of these girls were held with no more regard by the company than one would hold for the life of a single ant, all the mattered was the money that was being made for them. Dr Flinn was the doctor who had been examining and testing the girls for the company, who declared many times that the girls were perfectly healthy.\n\n\"Dr. Flinn had been examining the girls: taking blood, reading their x-rays. He had been arranging medical treatment and writing to the women on the letter-headed paper of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. “[I] understood,” said Grace’s physician Dr. McCaffrey, who’d arranged her examination with Flinn, “that Dr. Flinn was an MD.”\n\nIt turns out that Dr. Flinn's degree was in philosophy ... this was who Radium Dial had taking care of the girls for many months, if not years\n\nThe absolute horror that these girls went through was exponentially increased later with physical exams. As per their settlement, the girls were first examined by the company doctor, the girls' own doctor, and a mutually agreed upon doctor all working together. The girls were positive for radium, but two of the doctors thought there may be fraud by the girls, so they decided to re-do all of the exams, in a hotel room so the girls could be nude.\n\nOnly the company doctor, who did not believe radium poison existed, was present of the three appointed doctors. There were others in the room ... a doctor who was a close friend of the vice president of Radium Dial who took charge, another random doctor, and also the vice president himself, who \"assisted\". In a hotel room, with these poor girls nude, and these strange men were watching the examinations, pelvic exams included.\n\n\"The girls perceived at once that this was not an impartial exam, but what recourse did they have to stop it? It was part of their settlement that they would agree to medical procedures. And so they were forced to strip as directed and went through the tests with the company men watching all they did closely.\"\n\nThese women, no matter how severe their suffering, no matter how advanced their condition, never stopped fighting.\n\n\"The researchers even went to the Cook County Hospital and brought back Charlotte Purcell’s amputated arm; they found it still in its formaldehyde crypt, saved through the decades due to its never-before-seen symptoms.\"\n\n\"In 1963, perhaps at least partly in response to the research on the dial-painters, President Kennedy signed the international Limited Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited atomic tests above ground, underwater, and in outer space. Strontium-90, it had been determined, was too dangerous for humanity after all. The ban undoubtedly saved lives and, very possibly, the entire human race.\"\n\nWhat science learned from them has saved the lives of millions around the world, and is still saving people to this day ... that is their legacy.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to reading The Woman They Could Not Silence by this author.",
    "Bought this a gift for my wife. A very telling story of the sacrifice of American women in WWII working on bomb sights with radium for illumination. The unknown effects had a devastating effect on these women medically before the dangers of this radiation were known. A must read!",
    "What an amazing story this is! It is jaw-dropping to learn that radium was positioned as a health-giving tonic in early C20th USA with companies created to exploit this wonder element.\n\nMoore's story revolves around dial-painters, girls (some just teenagers) and women employed to paint the numbers on clocks, watches and other instruments using radium-infused luminous paint. Trained to shape the brushes by putting them in their mouths, they ingest quantities of radium, assured by the company that it'll put roses in their cheeks...\n\nIt's frightening to see how these young women think it's glamorous to go home with their hands, faces and clothes glowing in the dark - and their innocence at eating lunch at the same tables at which they work with the radium paint. Only later, they start to get ill...\n\nMoore does a fine job of keeping the balance between her big story of corporate lies and cover-ups, and the intimate, personal histories of the 'radium girls' themselves. The accounts of their sufferings are hard-hitting, and we're incensed at the way they are dismissed by fat-cat company directors concerned with protecting their profits, an uncaring burgeoning radium industry, a largely ignorant medical profession and the red-tape of legal bureaucracy that is ill-fitted to deal with their cases.\n\nThere are places where Moore's own emotions get the better of her and she inserts emotive asides or trembles barely on the right side of sentimentality - but these are fewer than some of the negative reviews make out and, honestly, this is such a gut-wrenching tale that I could understand and forgive.\n\nMost of all, this is utterly compelling reading - one of those books that I couldn't wait to get back to: a must-read.",
    "In 1917, 'dial painting' - highlighting clock faces and military instruments with luminous radium paint - is seen as an enviable job for young women; well-paid, glamorous and even patriotic. Radium has been hailed as a health-giving wonder-drug, so there is no need for the dial-painters to take precautions against ingesting it - if anything, the women are told, it will improve their health. Thus, the workers are encouraged to moisten their radium-filled brushes with their lips, often dozens of times an hour, and they take pride in going home with the ghostly glow of radium about their persons.\n\nBut, before long, the dial-painters start to experience ailments that just won't go away - bone decay, skin lesions, ulcerations that worsen with any attempt to treat them, confounding the doctors they consult until the common thread of radium is identified. So begins the women's struggle to have radium poisoning recognised as a condition, fighting against the might of the lucrative and powerful radium industry to receive compensation - and the radium industry will go to shocking lengths to cover up the dangers.\n\nKate Moore's book is a detailed account of the Radium Girls' experience, told partly in a novelistic style, which I felt worked well - the women's characters are brought to life through small imagined details of daily life, against a backdrop of factual information drawn from contemporary material. Moore successfully explains the importance of the women's experience in the wider context of medical science, and attitudes towards nuclear research in the later 20th century, and I think does justice to their tenacity in fighting a legal battle despite many setbacks and unimaginable physical suffering, to create a legacy from which society has continued to benefit.\n\nIt is a harrowing read; the illustrations showing the women are particularly sad - one can see all too clearly their frailty, but the story told is important and deserves a wide audience - it would make an excellent subject for a film. I was gripped from start to finish.",
    "In the early years of the 1900’s radium was considered a wonder drug – capable of healing all ills. Plus it was delightfully luminescent, its glow-in-the-dark qualities perfect for the watches and dials of the pilots and fighters during WWI. The women in the dial-painting studio pointed their brushed by licking the bristles before each stroke. Plus the glowing powder was so much fun – they would paint their faces and bodies to make pantomimes. What they didn’t know, what America didn’t know is that radium was also a secret killer – the effects being held at bay for years before unleashing their fury. It would take many years, many deaths and the perseverance of many women to finally win this fight – not just once but several times, before the public, the world, would acknowledge the dangers and take steps to protect the future.\nI bought it as i used to work with radiation and had heard the stories of the Radium Girls, so was keen to read it.",
    "This felt like a very long book but it was both so fascinating and horrible it was difficult to stop reading. That these girls were so young - some as young as fourteen when they began working with radium with little idea of the consequences to their health and mislead by uncaring employer's and the terrible way they suffered for so many years with medical conditions and the extremely long fight for justice was quite a story both tragic and uplifting in the bravery shown by these girls who glowed steeped in radium in their very bones facing hostility from the establishment is an amazing saga. There were heroes and champions but not enough and the fight for justice took so long. I learned a lot about radium and science and bravery and history and legal machinations and it was a very long but very worthwhile read. If you have the stomach for it.",
    "The topic of this book is a story that is harrowing and frustrating, but also vitally important to learn about. It's a horrific example of workers suffering brutally under unchecked capitalism, and the women's bravery in the face of such injustice is both impressive and touching.\n\nDespite my appreciation for the subject matter, I was so put off by the author's writing style that I almost gave up with the book at several points. Her writing includes far too much superfluous information and wild conjecture about the inner thoughts of the people involved. Most irritating of all were the needless dramatic hooks and interjections that seemed really out of place and only functioned to cheapen the story and its message.\n\nI was also horrified by the glossing-over of the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She simply states the atomic bombs helped the Allies' triumph, without a single mention of the Japanese civilians who then suffered from the consequences of radiation sickness for generations. After a detailed and clearly passionately researched book about the suffering radiation sickness caused the dial painters, the callous disregard for this event was, in my opinion, deeply disturbing. Oh, but don't worry, she does make sure to mention that no one working on the Manhattan Project got radiation sickness thanks to the Radium Girls...\n\nI'm arguably being petty at this point, but describing a medical issue experienced by one woman as bleeding from \"down below\"? Seriously?\n\nReally not the quality of writing I was hoping for."

    "This book is perfect for new generations. It really helps to improve your personality",
    "How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published in 1936. This is only the second time the material in it has been updated, this time under the supervision of Carnegie's daughter Donna. I am always amused when I hear someone denigrate authors of the bestselling \"self-help\" books such as Richard Carlson, Dale Carnegie, Paulo Coelho, Stephen Covey, Louise L. Hay, Napoleon Hill, Spencer Johnson, Robert T. Kiosaki, James Redfield, and Norman Vincent Peale. Millions of copies of their books are purchased each year, decades after most of their authors died. That indicates (at least to me) that the material provided in these \"classics\" has trans-generational appeal. Millions of people insist that the information, insights, and counsel are timely...and timeless.\n\nThat said, self-help classics such as Carnegie's are essentially worthless if those who read them are unwilling and/or unable to APPLY EFFECTIVELY what they have learned. This book has helped millions of people since it was first published in 1936. Readers deserve praise for what they achieved but Carnegie shares the credit for their personal growth and professional development. He and the material in this book activated their self-motivation...and they can do the same for you if (HUGE \"if\") you embrace the challenge. Henry Ford once said this about having the right attitude about success, however defined: \"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're probably right.\"\n\nMost personal limits are self-imposed. Many people become \"sick and tired of being sick and tired.\" They lack whatever self-confidence they once possessed.  They need to be convinced that they can -- REALLY CAN -- \"win friends and influence people\" if someone explains how. (They already understand the WHY.) Few people know that young Carnegie based his observations and suggestions on his own struggles.\n\nThese are among the strategic objectives that the Carnegie book --as well as the training programs based on it -- can help people to achieve:\n\no Build on their self-confidence and personal leadership competence.\no Strengthen their skills in relating to others and build inclusivity within their organization.\no Enhance their skills to communicate logically, clearly, and concisely. Energize and engage their listeners. And listen with empathy.\no Develop leadership skills to take charge of their lives, be more flexible and innovative, inspire others, and motivate others to action.\no Empower themselves to control attitudes and reduce stress so they can be at their optimum best.\n\nHere's my favorite insight among dozens that have guided and informed my behavior since I completed a Dale Carnegie Training course in Chicago during my junior year of high school: \"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.\"\n\nAnd here is a point whose importance cannot be exaggerated: Even if you had Dale Carnegie as your personal mentor, available full-time (24/7), he would have little (if any) impact on your personal growth and professional development unless and until you are TOTALLY COMMITTED to achieving both. They are interdependent.\n\nSo, are you all in or will you continue to live in the world of Woulda/Coulda/Shoulda, assuming little (if any) responsibility for the results of your efforts, the consequences of your decisions and non-decisions?\n\nHow about it? The choice is yours. It always was and always will be.",
    "As Stevo’s Novel Ideas, I am a long-time book reviewer, member of the media, an Influencer, and a content provider. I received this book as a free review copy from either the publisher, a publicist, or the author, and have not been compensated for reviewing or recommending it.\n\nThis book was Stevo's Business Book of the Week for the week of 5/29, as selected by Stevo's Book Reviews on the Internet and Stevo's Novel Ideas. \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" is a classic that has improved and transformed the personal and professional lives of millions.\n\nLet's face it. We're lazy when it comes to motivation. Few have the self-control to stay motivated without encouragement and inspiration from others: bosses, mentors, life-partners, friends, or from the authors of self-help books. Many self-help books are timely and a few are timeless. One of the latter, originally published in 1936, is Dale Carnegie's classic \"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\"\n\nThe book is now available in a second updated version. The first revised edition came out in 1981. Changes in this edition are a \"touch-up.\" Donna Carnegie says, \"We have eliminated some of the references to people or events that readers today would not recognize or that we felt were out of touch with today’s world, including some material that was added later on in the 1981 revision. We wanted to get back to the original as closely as possible, while simultaneously touching it up for tomorrow, so we started fresh and worked from the first 1936 edition, the undiluted source.\"\n\nI wish I had more time to do it, but I love getting into deep discussions with friends and colleagues that reveal the source of our emotions and provide insight on why we hold onto our opinions so tightly, even when we are confronted with factual evidence that they are wrong. Carnegie was one of the first to acknowledge that there is no way to \"win\" an argument based on an opinion.\n\nThough I wanted to read about how Carnegie would specifically tailor his approach to today's increasingly marginalized society, his advocacy of compassion, respect, empathy, being genuinely interested in others as well as a good listener, are definitely timeless.\n\nFind more Business Books of the Week, as well as many more reviewed and recommended books and products, by searching for me on Google.",

    "There are 2 books that I consider to be the best ones ever written on the subject of worry and anxiety. The first is this one, and the other is \"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,\" by Dale Carnegie. They can be read together or each one can be read alone. I've reviewed Dale Carnegie's book elsewhere, so now for this book. It truly is amazing when words in a book can be life changing. That's exactly what this book is. There are people who say that the contents of this book are so obvious that the book deserves only 1 star. They are entirely missing the point. The fact that everything the author states is obvious, makes it even more effective at reaching those who feel that their life is being overrun by worry and anxiety. Richard Carlson wrote this book in a simplistic manner for a reason. The simplicity in which it's written serves as a catalyst to provide instant relief from the burdens of everyday life. His main premise is that there is virtually nothing that is so important that it's worth ruining your life over with worry. If you read the entire book, which you can easily do in a day or two; you'll quickly realize that there is nothing in this world that's so important as to cause you to have constant worry and anxiety over. Life is short and 99.9% of the things that we worry about and that cause us intense anxiety, never happen. The tiny percentage of things that do happen, always have a solution. This book is incredibly helpful at completely eliminating worry and anxiety. It worked for me and it can work for you. Personally; reading just this book by itself cured me, however; I decided that I wanted to read the book mentioned above by Dale Carnegie as a companion to this one. I have to say that the 2 books combined will provide you with a firewall against any worry and anxiety that you have, regardless of how long you've had it. As a side note, sadly, Richard Carlson died at a very young age from a pulmonary embolism during a flight from San Francisco to New York. Life truly is short, so there's no point in spending it with worry and anxiety.",
    "I recommend this book to others as a quick guide for getting through life's ups and downs no matter what your age is or life circumstances are.",
    "I absolutely love and cherish this book. This book has changed my life. By nature, I'm not an easy-going person. I'm very driven and ambitious and by nature, it's been a blessing and a curse as it's helped me in areas of my life but failed me in relationships and friendships. This book was a life-changer. Granted, I've read other books which talk about the same principles in this book, ie. The Bible, \"How To Win Friends and Influence People\". But this book is different. There are a few books which have dynamically changed my life. Namely, \"Think and Grow Rich\", \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\", \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\" and I would list this book among them. It's the one book which contrasts with everything I've been programmed to know about life. Namely, this book teaches you to chill out. I find that after I've read this book, I am more understanding of things and I don't pout as much as I used to. I won't say that this book made me a better person but I can fairly say that this book opens your eyes and makes you realize when you are not being easy-going. This book does that. This book talks about basic things about handling stress and calming down but in a way which isn't preachy and in a way that's so simple to understand.The writing style and the way the chapters are laid out are done in a way where it's very easy to learn, very easy to absorb, very easy to practice...and most importantly...done in a way which permanently changes your outlook on life. I'm not saying this book will immediately make you easy-going and friendly but it helps by a large margin. I'd highly recommend this book.",
    "Over the years I've read numerous self help, success, motivational and business books and I have to say this is easily one of the most applicable, in that you can directly apply it to your life.\n\nYou get 100 short chapters where each idea is introduced and then briefly explained in plain, accessable language. Some ideas may seem a little rudimentary or simplistic, but it is in this simplicity that the real benefit lies. The ideas are easy to absorb, easy to implement and quick to see a result from.\n\nThis book is perfect to dip into and I often read one or two chapters each day to get a little boost of positivity and ideas to cope with stressful situations. I'm not saying I'm now all peace and light, but I've definitely been able to use the ideas written about here on more than one occasion.\n\nIf other books of this type have left you a little cold or if you're looking for a daily kick in the behind, this could well be the book for you.",
    "Positive or negative, whatever your predominant character type you wont be one or the other all of the time.\n\nI consider myself to be a glass half full kind of person for the most of the time, but for those other times, I find that reading something positive helps me put some perspective on things.\n\nI have read this book many times, I love the short chapters and common sense descriptions. Much of the stuff in this book is not new to self help book lovers, but it is how it is written that makes the difference.\n\nRichard Carlson wrote this with simple examples of things we do or feel in everyday life. You can read a chapter or a few chapters when you feel that everything is a little too much for you. It won't necessarily wave a magic wand, but it does give you some perspective.\n\nI have bought several copies of this over the years, my original copy I still have; as for the others, well they have been for friends or family at times in their lives when a perspective shift couldn't hurt.",
    "Everything in this book is simple.\nIt's an easy read for those of you who hate self-help books, and crammed full of simple strategies that'll help even those who think they have a grip on everything.\nThere is quite a bit of repetition, but that only serves to reinforce the basis for the whole approach - to focus on the positive, ignore/rise above the negative.\nSadly all the things in this book are all blatantly obvious, and you could pinch yourself as you read, thinking 'well duh! I knew that', but that's the point: we've conditioned ourselves to ignore our inner compass and be guided by warped ideas and 'keeping up with the Jones''.\nSo ditch all the plans for a making your life better with stuff, and focus on enjoying the journey and listening to the birds along the way.",
    "Super speedy delivery, great condition.\nGood easy read with lots of make sense tips for being a happier person and not dwelling on trivial silly things. Would also recommend the book called...stop thinking start living... by the same author. I am reading these due to massive anxiety and panic attacks, they have defiantly helping to put things into a bit more perspective.",
    "I love this book. I have given it as gifts to my friends! It's my go to when things get a little bit too much and people start getting on my nerves. Or if I'm feeling a little out of control with life in general. Always by my nightstand so I can flick through the short chapters and feel good again. Great for those that don't have a lot of patience for reading long passages in books."

    "Lots to consider.",
    "This book is amazing! I wish I would’ve had this earlier in my life, but it’s always good to make better habits, especially with money. This book shows you how to save and live like no one else. I think that’s what everyone wants out of their money life is to be able to save for a rainy day, and not worry. I highly recommend this book especially for young people starting out. It seems like nowadays they do not know how to save money. The book and workbook go hand in hand! I highly recommend this book!",
    "This book is very helpful for someone who wants to leaned and change money habits",
    "If you have the actual book you really don't need the workbook. Good info but basically a review of the actual book.",
    "I wish I would've read this book before I started college. Shows you glaring truths about how you might be causing your own poverty with your bad spending habits. Or, maybe you just live in a blue state with crappy jobs. I was there once. Anyhow, this book will help you get out of debt & achieve your financial goals if you give it your best efforts! Everyone should read this book. Twice!",
    "Wow. I bought this book a decade ago at half-price books. 10 years or so later, I am debt-free, car payment free, mortgage free, with 2 years’ living expenses saved up in the bank. A lot of it was luck, but we all have luck. When we focus on a set goal we begin to spot luck that we would’ve missed.\n\nAlong the pathway, we fixed our marriage and so much more because the only way to build a team is to accomplish something hard together. This book will take you step by step to that goal. It’s the only thing I’ve seen that works.\n\nMy wife died earlier in the year but said she was at peace because we were doing fine financially, and so now it’s just me and the kids. I am lucky to have discovered Dave Ramsey when I did.\n\nAnd now at 49, I am a n the verge of retirement. I will work here and there but my goal is to relax and spend time with my son for a few years. I may write a book or do something different and self-directed but I am free now.",
    "I found many of the exercises in this workbook useful for further understanding personal financing. The chapter on retirement is particularly useful.\n\nI purchased the Kindle version of the book, but as I read through it, I wish I purchased the paper version instead to mark up and complete the exercises. Nevertheless, I just highlighted passages in the Kindle version and copied and pasted selected exercises in my digital journal so that I can review them later.\n\nWhile the Makeover workbook is must read for personal finance management, I disagree with Ramsey on the advice of paying with cash. As a three-year user of the YouNeedaBudget.com budget-to-zero method, I have disciplined myself to use my two credit cards like debit cards. Because I use the YNAB application to budget, I pay off my credit balances every month, sometimes a a few times a mouth, because I don't allow my balances to go over 30% of my credit line, to maintain a credit score. By using the cards instead of cash, I can keep track of every dollar I spend, and I can effectively budget for all my monthly and future expenses. Plus I get reward points for using the cards.\n\nThe Makeover Workbook is useful for thinking about money management (seriously avoid debt like a plague), but YNAB is the tool than can help you build a budgeting discipline. YNAB has helped me save thousands of dollars even though I have relatively limited freelance, contract income.",
    "This is a great tool for anyone looking to straighten out their finances and get it right",
    "It's basically a book for people with little common sense about money -- people who \"keep up with the Joneses\", think credit cards are safety nets, impulse buy with loans, and don't understand how assets are divided and paid for after divorces. The tone of the book starts off as \"everything you know about money and your relationship to it is wrong\" and as a way to open the book this works, however, it doesn't let up throughout. It becomes increasingly condescending. This is most evident in the true/false quizzes where the answers are going to be \"obviously\" one or the other. Obvious to the person who doesn't need this book, anyway.\n\nI bought it in an effort to develop my knowledge about how to better grow my money, since every month I break even and don't save, and don't have any exorbitant expenses or debts. If you're in a similar position, try another title.",
    "Good principles but not suitable for those in the UK (everything is in $USA).",
    "One of the best books I have ever read. I have learnt so much from this book. I purchased audio. I enjoyed his tone of voice. Well explained. I was in the verge of buying a new car which was arrived in the country in a few weeks. On completion of reading the book I cancelled my order. I'm still driving my car which is only 4 years old and decided I'll buy my next car brand new. I no longer need an accountant to go through my finances. I also bought \"Financial peace.\". I highly recommend this book it will change your life.",
    "I loved the total money makeover. Less all the stuff about weight loss. This is basically the exact same book with some updated statistics and a bunch of multiple choice Q&A built in that is quite donting. I regret buying it",
    "Excellent book - it is US so you might have to translate to corresponding Canadian pensions and financial programs. Well worth doing the exercises and watching his videos on YouTube as you go along. He also has a online website with the necessary tools - budgets, etc for free."

    "This is one of the best books written on culture-building and leadership. It is so easy to follow (this coming from someone who knows little to nothing about rugby) and the lessons are super impactful. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an elite team culture!",
    "There's a lot of surprising nuggets about being a great leader in this book and it provides different ways of communicating with people in order to be the best leader you can be",
    "Item arrived in good condition, and not in very good condition as described. I appreciated the timely delivery.",
    "Great book on leadership and life regardless of the profession. For those of us who are rugby aficionados, it explains the basis of the All Black’s success.",
    "I enjoyed the analogies to life. Good rugby requires selflessness and sacrifice. It only makes sense that a sense of purpose is therefore key to performance as a team. I was raised in NZ and played rugby as a boy. I remember it fondly and recall that these values were typical not only on the field but seemingly also ingrained in NZ culture.\nThe ideas in the book are presented in an easy to understand and interesting way. I found them inspiring and will share them with my two sons who are currently navigating their way through competitive basketball in the U.S. , a sport where attention is often showered upon individual performance/ambition rather than the team and selfish players are too often tolerated beyond common sense.",
    "This book in my opinion is probably the best that I have ever read on creating and understanding culture. I served in the United States Marine Corps for 14 years and currently serving as an assistant coach on a high school football team. We are currently trying to establish a proud culture for a team that has 3 wins in 5 years. I would recommend this book to anyone in any kind of leadership position.",
    "Good stuff. Some old and proven themes but definitely highlights the power of culture and self-purpose, a unique challenge for the extremely diverse latest generation of adults.",
    "This is a book that often comes up when coaching book recommendations are discussed. That's where I heard about it. I want to stress up front, though, that this in not a coaching book. Amazon at this writing has it listed in Sports Psychology, but that doesn't fit either, to my mind. I think the book description does a pretty good job of saying what it's really about.\n\n\"In Legacy, best-selling author James Kerr goes deep into the heart of the world's most successful sporting team, the legendary All Blacks of New Zealand, to reveal 15 powerful and practical lessons for leadership and business.\"\n\nFocus on that last part about lessons for leadership and business. That is most definitely what the author provides.\n\nAs for the rest of it, I have my issues. The description makes it sound like the story of the All Blacks is the core material. In particular, the team's transformation after a period of uncharacteristic under-performance is meant to be the main focus. While that story provides a framework, that's about all. You can perhaps work out the time line of that transition, but it's presented piecemeal. One of my problems with the book was that at points I didn't know where the author was in the All Blacks history when he shared certain stories. It was rather annoying.\n\nAlso, the All Blacks are not the only references the author makes. He includes ideas from the likes of Phil Jackson and Bill Walsh as well, in terms of sports. There are a number of non-sports references too.\n\nObviously, I have no problem with references to all-time great coaches. Sometimes the language of the text is a little too stereotypical of leadership books, and there is too much repetition of certain elements for my taste. Overall, though, the \"lessons\", concepts, and explanations are quite worthwhile.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a book worth reading if you go into it with the right set of expectations.",
    "This book was recommended to me by a fellow CEO, particularly in light of the agreement the All Blacks made with themselves that nobody else cleans up after them as a team. Regardless of your interest in sport or in rugby, this is a book well worth reading. In their pursuit of consistently outstanding performance, the All-Blacks and their coaches have come up with an approach that demands the highest of standards, that roots the people on the team in a clear continuum of history, culture, space and time, yet which values and supports each of the people that make the grade as people as much as players. It is a belief and values system that does not distinguish between life off the pitch and life on the pitch. Players are people - and as such they need to be treated as such, and challenged as such. While I am not sure if each of the 15 rules or insights is totally distinct from all the rest, they do make sense once you understand this overall context.",
    "Listen - it is yet another leadership book but it is rooted within culture and belief from the All Blacks who, let's face it - are pretty legendary. Mentality and belief in success along with planning etc.\n\nThat said, it is now 30th October and my wonderful England WALLOPED the All Blacks Saturday gone so I expect a book from the same author on 'transforming a naff culture into a great one' in early 2020.",
    "I had heard this book mentioned several times, so I was keen to read it. Maybe I'm a victim of having high expectations but I was underwhelmed.\n\nThe author has found 15 ideas that the success of the all blacks can be attributed to. They're interesting to read, but they're somewhat strung out into a chapter each. The format of each chapter is taking one of the principles, embellishing it with a few extra rugby stories, then more general quotes, then a story or two from the business world. I felt the book is trying to do too many things and I found myself Akim reading the last 4 chapters and not feeling like I was missing anything.\n\nIt's an ok read, but perhaps not the heavyweight I'd hoped for.",
    "This book was recommended to me when I was on a football coaching course. The tutor used it as an example to stress the importance of the collective mentality needed to succeed at the highest level and how the development of a culture that has been cultivated over time is deep rooted in success. It is a fascinating read and one from a coaching perspective encapsulates what top level sporting success looks like - it is more than just about talented individual parts and the All Blacks owe their success to a far greater appreciation and application of what team work, ethics, morals and the collective desire requires. Interviews and quotes throughout the book help hugely paint the picture with the overriding message being that passing these superstars of the game know they have a limited time wearing the iconic all black shirt and that what went before and comes after is their responsibility. A truly incredible mindset and beautifully captured by the author. A powrful book that is highly recommended. There are lessons here beyond sport too...",
    "A lot of high faulting cod philosophy and endless repetition of un-pronouncable Maori phrases. Mercilessly padded with the last twenty pages given over to thanking everyone mentioned in the book. A great disappointment about what should be a fascinating subject"

    "This book was definitely a page turner! I learned a lot of valuable information that definitely going to apply to my investment journey.",
    "Really enjoyed this book, thought was one I had to read to educate myself and be bland but turned out Peter Lynch has a good sense of humor.\n\nLearned alot aswell.",
    "Great book, easy read, full of knowledge",
    "For any investor this is a must read. Quite easy to understand and written well.",
    "One of the best books on investing next to “The Intelligent Investor”. His style is humorous and covers a lot of material, includes some very useful basic formulas to analyze the fundamentals of stocks (like “long term growth + dividend yield) / P/E ratio” ). it reads easily and his style makes it feel like a fun lesson. Every investor should read it.",
    "One of the best books on investing if you have started investing and want to learn more. I recommend this to everyone. This book should be part of every high school financial education.",
    "The book is a must for anyone buying stocks. It is very easy to understand and really fun also as the author can be perceived as someone with a great sense of humor.",
    "I enjoyed reading it and learned a great deal from it. Although the book was written over 25 years ago, the fundamentals should not change. Peter Lynch did an excellent job of explaining the basics of investing in stock market. I particularly liked the point he makes, that one does not have to a professional or even listen to pros to be successful in the market. According to him, odds may be in your favor, because you may have an edge from your personal experience in a certain field, or simply from your daily life. Professional fund managers, on the other hand, have too many restrictions and limits which make it difficult to maximize the gains. Furthermore, you can identify winners even before a stock gets overpriced because of its recommendations by analysts.\nOne of the most important things is to have a good understanding of the business of the company that you want to invest in. As he puts it, he would invest in pantyhose rather than communication satellites, or in motel chains than in fiber optics. The simpler the business, better it is, because those companies are perhaps easier to run and follow. According to him, some of the desirable attributes may be that it sounds dull or even better, ridiculous or has something depressing about it. Just to be ridiculous about it. If that is the case, the chances are that many stock analysts may not be following. Other attributes that can be of particular interest are following: it’s a spin-off; institutions don’t own it, and analysts don’t follow it, it has got a niche, people have to keep buying it, insiders are buyers, or the company is buying back shares. I think there is a lot of wisdom right there.\nEqually interesting is the chapter on stocks to avoid. He would avoid one that is hottest in the hottest industry or touted as the next big thing or those whispered in your ears. They usually don’t pan out. His examples and illustrations are bit outdated because of the time the book was originally written, but the points are well driven.\nThen he goes on say that it is important to classify the company that you have picked in one of the following six general categories: slow growers, stalwarts, fast grower, cyclical, assets play and turnaround. It would not only allow you to set your expectations, but also help you to make decisions along the way by bench marking other companies in the same category. The second step after picking a company is to check the company fundamentals such as, earnings, cash flow and fact-checking the story. He also described in detail how to get most out of company’s annual reports.\nThis book has a wealth of valuable information that is presented with simplicity and humor. The thing I liked about Peter Lynch is that he highlights his mistake, not his successes. I guess being a stalwart of the industry; he does not need to beat his own drums. I would recommend this book highly. It’s a classic.",
    "There is something endearing about Peter Lynch's approach. He takes the view that the average retail (amateur) investor can beat the professionals by using common sense and exercising self-control. Whilst investment is always a gamble, the shrewd investor can find companies that swing the odds in favour of a win. Peter Lynch liked companies with a good product that he could understand - he bought into Taco Bell because he liked their coffee, and because he saw it was a strong company with sound management and plenty of room to grow. As a part of his research he would visit company offices. If he found shabby offices with frayed carpets and cracked linoleum in a downbeat part of town, he would reason that these companies put all their money into the business and not into glitzy office blocks. And he would invest. But he shied away from companies that spent their profits unwisely on unnecessary status symbols and acquisitions. All in all his advice is practical. Be your own person. Don't follow the herd. Don't worry about the macro-economic situation. Don't focus on short term movements in share price. Don't pay too much attention to complicated things like charts. Be patient. Be slow to buy and slow to sell. And above all know the company in which you're investing.\n\nThis is a charming book written by a modest and engaging character, full of great anecdotes and sound advice. It has a place in my top twenty books on investing. Thoroughly recommended,.",
    "Given when the book was written a lot of what is described in the book is very outdated, naturally. The basic message he conveys though is as true today as ever. Probably truer now than ever with the amount of day traders using apps like Robinhood to blindly gamble on stocks, resulting in them being pushed up well above their real value. Certainly if everyone adhered to the logic in this book during the late 90s early 00s the Dot.com bubble wouldn't have happened.\nIt's an entertaining read which I think provides a lot of fundamentals for being a long term investor, and how to keep your head about you during bad and good times.\nI will say that the author is a self proclaimed techno-phobe (despite having a large holding in Apple when he wrote the book), and mentions that he's inclined to steer clear of tech companies. As clever as this was before the dot.com crash it isn't great advice in 2020.",
    "Lots of people will recommend  Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing - A Book of Practical Counsel  as the best investing book out there (Warren Buffet included) but in my opinion this trumps it. Peter Lynch's down to earth approach to investing is very clearly explained and keeps it all very interesting which is no mean feat - investing is a very dry subject.\n\nI particularly like the sections where he details some of his investments (good and bad) and includes the charts explaining where he bought and sold and the reasoning behind that. Peter actually goes quite in depth on some of his biggest mistakes which is a really nice touch and takes it away from being overly preachy like a lot of other investment books.\n\nSo far I've read it twice and I fully intend to read it again.",
    "I read a lot of finance books and have worked in this field for many years. I think this book is a nice breeze of fresh air in the field. The writer is entertaining and goes through various concepts without boring the reader.\nThe book is aimed at simplifying the idea of investing for retail investors. By highlighting that on a daily basis, people interact with various brands and products, by paying attention to those interactions, one can potentially find a good investment idea.\nI do prefer books like intelligent investor or Security Analysis but I do appreciate the simplicity and common sense brought by One Up on Wall Street.",
    "This book is more of a story about how Peter Lynch operated, than a technical guide to stock selection. It outlines his approach: look for companies about which you know something; do not buy too \"expensive\" on a P/E or Book Value basis (both restrictions could be disputed, but it is Mr Lynch's style).\n\nIn one place he is dismissive of technical analysis, so do not expect that.\n\nGiven that this was written 20 years ago, it is remarkable that so many good principles, and bad practices, can be seen widely today.\n\nWorth reading, even if you do not follow the Lynch approach."

    "Good concept, not rocket science to be honest and the use of the acronym WIG is a bit annoying and funny at the same time.. Coming from a bald guy. You will pick up some good pointers.. Its worth the money",
    "I loved the first book and feel the second edition is a worthy bump of insight, focus, weight and new information. Bravo.\n\nThe only bone I have to pick is that as of the time of this review (May5, 2021) the links to resources... at least for me, don't go to the promised resources. Big integrity break for all concerned. Perhaps they just need another read of The 4 Disciplines of Execution second edition...?\n\nThe other issue is that the 4DXOS smart phone app is only available if you hire their consultants. They seem to miss the fact that for a book published in 2012 and ranking as the #1 Business Bestseller according to the Wall Street Journal that there are tens of thousands of practitioners out there that just want to get on with it with the help of the application and don't actually have time to go through the consulting deal. If they want to drive word-of-mouth make the application available for a solid price and that will drive there consulting business to a level that this approach can never touch...

    "If you loved the first edition as I did, and may think this second edition can only get better, I'm saying go slow and get one copy first to be sure. There are things that seem to be missing from the second edition that, to me, seemed very helpful that are missing, or moved and I can't find them. As an example the graphic on the bottom of page 42 of the first edition that takes you from strategic intent to specific finish lines is gone. I find those kind of visuals very helpful. Some of the new content is not organized in a way that seems best. Why would you talk about team leaders before you talk about leaders of leaders? At least explain it to me so I understand the logic. To me that seems out of order. I stopped reading in frustration after 50 pages and pulled out the first edition to figure out why.\n\nBut I will hedge my bet and try to read more of this second edition with an open mind. Perhaps it will grow on me. However I'm mad that I ordered three copies thinking this would be a winner. I should have only order one to make sure first. I'll provide another review when...if....I can get through this new edition.",

    "Allowed me review my thought process and as a coder made me think about how computers work.\nBe of what mode you are in and you will master your self",
    "Would you like to live a more pleasant life? Wouldn't it be great to solve your problems using effective questioning? Are you feeling unclear of what your true destiny is? Do you desire to quit a bad habit? If you answered yes to any of these questions, I recommend that you pick up this book and implement every exercise and techniques that he teaches within the book.\n\nI picked up the book, \"Awaken the Giant Within\" because I came across Tony Robbin's audio on youtube that had a similar theme. The hour long audio made me feel empowered enough that I wanted to know more about the author. I recommend this book if you would like to discover your true life's purpose and the steps to achieving your goals efficiently and effectively while taking complete control of your life.\n\nTony Robbin's has a reputation as a successful businessman and he teaches people how to master their emotions. He is our nation's leader in peak performance and an expert in the psychology of change. In his early life, his mother was an alcoholic who has had several husbands, while his father was absent in his life. He's like many of us, but decided without any formal education in psychology to begin his own work as a self-help coach.\n\nWithin this book he emphasizes how beliefs, values, and your rules affect your behaviors. He links pain and pleasure as the reason why people make decisions. For example, if an individual is overweight and desires weight loss, but links a lot more pleasure to eating unhealthy foods and pain when it comes to exercising, then they aren't making a change to their behavior. Tony Robbins gives step by step tips on how to associate pain to your bad habits so that you can ultimately stop those decisions or bad habits and make better life choices.\n\nTony also explains the importance of asking your self quality questions. He regularly uses \"Seek and you shall find\" and describes how your mind will find whatever you tell it to seek. If you ask lousy questions, you will get lousy answers.\n\nHe then explains how our every day vocabulary and metaphors can affect the way we are feeling. For example, using the metaphor, \"I hit a brick wall\" means \"I'm feeling stuck\" and Tony teaches how to break those metaphorical patterns by responding to this by saying, \"Then climb over the wall\" or \"Then go around it.\" He describes how we can use our everyday language to benefit our daily lives.\n\nTony later mentions within the book that our identity is what we make ourselves to be. For example, an individual can identify them-self as an alcoholic and this will cause them to desire alcohol. In order to stop drinking, the person must start seeing themselves as a non-alcoholic to begin creating lasting changes. The person would have to create a new experience and reference points to provide them with this newer, beneficial belief. Even small successes that occur will give an individual the belief that they WILL succeed.\n\nHe then mentions the, \"CANI\" attitude meaning \"Constant and Never Ending improvement.\" By going beyond what we set our limits are is enough know that we CAN be successful. The attitude is, \"If I CAN do this activity, what other activities, CAN I do?\" This attitude is about how accomplishments can cause you to do activities that you may have felt wasn't of your ability. As your confidence increases with your accomplishments, you will begin to believe that you CAN do more.\n\nThe difference about this book and many other self-help books is that it gives several examples and also gives a more interactive experience with the exercises he has within this book. This book has benefited me because I feel more in control of my emotions. I used to stress out a lot but found that it was so much better for me to put my energy in a more beneficial place. Because of the knowledge I have obtained from this book, I have found myself noticing patterns of people's behaviors and how it benefits them and also how it ruins them. I found that Tony's techniques have been useful is creating a more pleasant lifestyle that is healthier for my body and the people around me.\n\nI can confirm that because of this book, the people I have surrounded myself with have changed as I became better. I am now surrounded by more successful individuals, and people who have similar interests in being in control of their life. This book will give you a fresh perspective on your life and the factors that contribute to why you are where you are. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for the assistance of this book.",
    "This book was a wonderful read into Tony Roberts life.",
    "I just like it very motivates me",
    "Often referred to by me as \"The Book\", I can't believe I've never written a review of it before. This book has changed and improved my life in a way that no other ever has. I casually refer to Anthony Robbins as \"Uncle Tony\" because his words feel like sage advice from a favorite uncle. It is constantly within easy reach, either on my desk where I spend most of my time, or on my nightstand by the bed. It it well-worn, highlighted and color-coded so that I can find key concepts at a glance any time I pick it up. I have purchased and given away many copies, to all of my closest friends. In my eyes, it is THE most valuable gift I can give to anyone, because as corny as it sounds, I feel as though I am giving the keys to LIFE. Yes, it is THAT important to me.\n\nThe crux of this book is finding and realizing the power within yourself to make any change and improvement. We all have amazing strength, power and determination within us. Once we learn how to utilize that, there is nothing that can stop us from achieving our dreams. Many have criticized Robbins for \"merely stating the obvious\", but you'd be surprised how many people miss what is right there in front of us all the time. What he does is guide you into taking your blinders off and helping you to step out of yourself to really SEE the forces that guide every action we take. What it all comes down to is this: in the simplest, most basic terms everything we do, EVERY SINGLE THING, is an action to either avoid pain or gain pleasure. And we will often go to far greater lengths to avoid (usually imagined or over-estimated) pain than to gain pleasure. Also many times we take the easy route to short-term pleasure that leads to long-term pain, rather then suffer through some short-term pain to gain long-term pleasure. Once you are able to determine the motivations behind your goals and actions, you will be able to use them to your benefit to overcome any obstacle and make all of your dreams come true. Anything is possible once you put these forces to work for you instead of against you. :)\n\nMy only criticism with this book is that Robbins relies heavily on personal anecdotes (frequently in conjunction with abundant name-dropping) that can easily come off as self-congratulatory. This is where my highlighting has been most beneficial because it allows me to skip over all of that to find the core message.\n\nWhile I honestly have yet to read it cover to cover, just reading and re-reading the first 10 chapters have been enough to make huge improvements in my life. Currently I am working on reading the entire book finally. :)\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this book to ANYONE who is unhappy with ANY aspect of his/her life and wishes to make some changes, no matter how large or small. The person who turned me on to Uncle Tony said he used the principles in this book to get out of a bad relationship, quit smoking, stop using drugs, and put himself back on the right path. I have personally used this book to break out \"learned helplessness\" and feeling like I had no control over my life. Now I know that nothing controls my life more than I do. I am always referring back when I feel like I am in a rut. It never fails to give me a fresh perspective. :)",
    "Excellent book. Outstanding! Highly recommend.",
    "My slightly dog-eared copy of Awaken the Giant Within appeared on Friday and 100 pages in, I feel compelled to convince you to buy it! Having just rewritten my limiting beliefs into empowering beliefs I am feeling able to face any challenge as though I have Robbins himself alongside me for support. The book contains actionable, accurate, concise advice that you cannot afford not to take. I implore you to buy this book ASAP and awaken your giant within!",
    "I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was encouraging and the principles, although common are effective.\n\nIt assisted me in work and pressed me forwards. As mentioned, however, other people do the same by the same means.\n\nI was highly disappointed in Tony Robbins when he became highly aggressive in his nature (and I know why) and so, I don't follow him any more.",
    "This book will change your life - just follow through and do the exercises while you're reading it.\n\nNot easy to commit to everything, but if it sends you in the right direction it can't be bad!",
    "Tony Robbins exemplifies his life coach teaching styles in a way that empowers the reader to self fulfilment. This book forces you to conduct a reality check and take a hard look in the mirror. It helps you to realize your flaws and \"TAKE ACTION\" and do something about it. After reading this book I was able to get out of my depression and stop blaming others for my pitfalls. I went from a 6 figure job to unemployed and almost losing my home. I moved in with my parents and that is when I bought this book. Since then (2008) I have used the information towards my own benefit and accomplished things I never thought I could, money, happiness, health and the most important lesson was to slow down and enjoy everything I do. I hope you are able to grab the flame from this book and empower yourself with the use of wisdom Tony has put together.\n\nBasic lesson is this: You are a reflection of all of your past thoughts and actions...but you are not your past...its all in your mind stuck leaving you in a rut and this book is the tow truck to help \"you\" get yourself out.",
    "I say the above but have not read the book fully myself but my father was in hospital last year and this book was what I lent him as I hadn't started it at the time but seeing him go for the dejected poor-me attitude he had to one of active exploration and working on sorting varied issues he had"

    "Abstract\n\nPatrick Lencioni, in his book, Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Field Guide for Leaders, Managers, and Facilitators, gives a detailed easy to follow plan on how to overcome the dysfunctions that many teams face. Lencioni says that teamwork is what is often missing from teams that are successful and then goes on to identify the five dysfunctions that many teams face. The five dysfunctions are the absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and finally inattention to results. These five dysfunctions lay the foundation for his book as he explores each dysfunction and gives practical help on how the dysfunctions can be corrected and the team can achieve a healthy status.\nThe first dysfunction, absence of trust, is the foundation of a healthy team. Lencioni says, “I’ve come to one inescapable conclusion: no quality or characteristic is more important than trust.” For trust to be achieved within a team than leaders and team members must be vulnerable about their weaknesses, fears, and failures. The author goes on to give case studies of teams that lacked trust in their organization and how these teams achieved trust. Lencioni believes that team members need to reveal personal aspects of their lives so that other team members can better understand each other and put their guards down. As with all the five dysfunctions, the book gives great practices that can help teams accomplish trust.\nThe second issue that teams must deal with is mastering conflict. It is important to know that mastering conflict can only be accomplished after trust is established. Conflict, as described by Lencioni, as “productive, ideological conflict: passionate, unfiltered debate around issues of importance to the team.” Conflict can be difficult for some but “if team members are never pushing one another outside of their emotional comfort zones during discussions, then it is extremely likely that they’re not making the best decisions for the organization.” If a team is going to overcome this dysfunction than the leader of the team at times needs to mine for conflict.\nThe third dysfunction is the lack of commitment. To achieve commitment there most be clarity in what the team is trying to accomplish; this does not mean that everyone on the team must agree but rather be committed to the decisions made, even when they do not agree. Team members are committed because they believe in the bigger purpose or mission of the organization rather than every decision that is being made.\nAvoidance of accountability is the fourth dysfunction that teams face. In order to overcome this dysfunction team members must embrace accountability, defined as “the willingness of team members to remind one another when they are not living up to the performance standards of the group.” This means that team members are willing to have difficult conversations with other team members that are not pulling their weight for the good of the organization.\nFocusing on results is how the final dysfunction is overcome. Teams need to be results-oriented and have a clear measurement of success. When teams understand what success looks like they can avoid distractions, such as ego, career development, and money. Lencioni suggest a visual scoreboard so employees will focus on the right tasks.\nThe third and fourth sections of the book give practical help to better flesh out how teams can achieve a healthy status. Section three answers common questions that many teams have after reading the book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. The fourth section of the book gives very detailed tools and exercises for a team to use to overcome each dysfunction.\n\nConcrete Response\n\nAs Lencioni began to unpack the importance of building trust among team members I was reminded about a time in the life of our staff where there was vulnerability which increased the level of trust. Lencioni said, “when team members reveal aspects of their personal lives to their peers, they learn to get comfortable being open with them about other things. They begin to let down their guard about their strengths, weaknesses, opinions, and ideas.” Over the past year at least once a month we have been “huddling” our staff. During a huddle, we don’t talk about the business of our church, but rather we share about what God is teaching us and how we are personally doing as leaders. These huddles started out very slow, and there was never anything that was shared that was deep or vulnerable. Weeks and even months went by of surface level sharing; we did not have a foundation of trust. It all changed when one of the quieter members of our teams spoke up and started sharing about the difficulties he and his wife were having with one of their children. Fred, the quiet staff member, was struggling with his youngest son being diagnosed with a severe case of autism. Fred, a very smart individual, shared about his inadequacies as a father and how he just felt hopeless, not knowing what to do. As Fred tearfully shared everyone’s heart in the groups went out to him and there was a time of encouragement and prayer for Fred. This transparency moved our group to a deeper level and more people began sharing intimate details of their lives. While Fred’s intentions were not to increase the level of trust within the group that is exactly what he did. Fred unknowingly helped our team move one step closer to being a healthy group.\n\nReflection\n\nIn reading through Lencioni's book, I thought that he did an excellent job achieving his goal of summarizing the five dysfunctions of a team and then giving practical advice on how leaders can help their teams overcome these dysfunctions. It is obvious that Lencioni has incredible knowledge and experience working with teams and it showed in this book. I not only enjoyed the concepts listed in this book but I also enjoyed the writing style of Lencioni and his attention to detail and practical information.\nWhile I found the book simplistic and easy to follow, I noticed that the book lacked concrete data or studies that help strengthen the author's argument. While I understand the five dysfunctions that Lencioni lists, he doesn't give any empirical evidence to show that these dysfunctions are the main culprits for an unhealthy team. The argument in this book could have been strengthened if the author would have done more research, polls, and studies and not make conclusions only based on his personal experience.\nI am also under the assumption that Lencioni's expertise is working with corporate America. In many of the examples and case studies, he shares about CEO's and other high-level executives. While I appreciate his willingness to work with these top executives, I would have appreciated more examples within the non-profit world. I have a small staff team that I lead but a majority of my time is spent working with volunteer teams. It would be helpful to see some practical example of how to overcome the five dysfunctions within a volunteer team.\n\nAction\n\nThe first dysfunction, building trust within the team, was the first area where I realized that I needed to take action. In talking about how you can build trust in teams, Lencioni says, “providing team members with common vocabulary for describing their differences and similarities, you make it safe for them to give each other feedback without feeling like they’re making accusatory or unfounded generalizations.” He goes on to recommend completing a profiling test with each team, such as the Myers-Briggs test. About a month ago one of our other team members asked if we could take the Myers-Briggs test as a staff. I didn’t see the need for it, plus I noticed that there would be a substantial cost for all of our team members to take the assessment. After reading through this book, I now realize that this assessment could help our team establish trust and better understand one another. The plan after reading this text is to hire someone who can administer the test to our team and then review the results with everyone; fortunately, we know someone who is trained in this material. I believe that once the team takes the assessment we will better understand each other and it will build trust among our team members. The plan is to have all our staff members complete this assessment by the end of April.\nThe second action that I need to implement into my life deals directly with the dysfunction of lack of commitment. While I believe that for the most part our staff is on board with the mission and vision of our church, we don’t do a great job at clearly measuring success. One of the ways Lencioni creates clarification is by creating a visual scoreboard that is a regular reminder of what the team is trying to accomplish. In addition to the visual scoreboard, Lencioni also suggests that you spend the last five minutes of a meeting asking the question: “What exactly have we decided here today?” By asking this question, the team is forced to communicate with each other until everyone is one the same page. I plan on using both the visual scoreboard and the commitment clarification exercise with our staff to help everyone be committed to what God has called our church to do. I will attach a large white board on our conference room wall. On the top right-hand corner, we will weekly track our attendance, number of guests, salvations, and baptisms. These numbers will be updated weekly and be a visual reminder of our mission, “to reach people far from God and lead them to become followers of Jesus.” On the same whiteboard after every staff, elders, and volunteer meeting I plan on asking the question, “what exactly have we decided here today?” In addition, to answering this question I would also like to answer the question, “in light of the decisions that were made, what is everyone going to do?” This not only clarifies expectations but also clarifies what everyone is going to do based on the information that was decided in the meeting.\n",
    "A great book, getting to the point of why teams fail, and offering corrective actions to avoid team failure. Easy to read plainly written, a must for all new managers and even seasoned managers will be better for reading this.",
    "This version of the original book lives up to its name as a \"field guide\". As I read the book, I couldn't help but think of \"my team\", which is where this book hits the mark. I could actually see my teams strengths, as well as opps for growth AS I READ THE BOOK! I even facilitated one of the exercises with my team today with profound results and productive conversation.\n\nThe ONLY reason I did not give this a 5th star is because I would have preferred just a little more substance. Not that I wanted to read a 400 page volume on the subjects addressed, it seemed however, as if the content was forced to fill the space it did. This could have been an 80 page book easily. Additionally, some of the guidance offered seems a bit obscure in places and points to further study elsewhere which I would have preferred in the book itself. Furthermore, the couple of external links I clicked on for further research led to the home pages of cites listed rather than the direct page/resource I was looking for.",
    "First, if you are looking for something to help your team that is more of a task based team you may want to look elsewhere. As the workbook says, this book is directed toward management teams. The book uses a fictional example to teach its lesson, meaning you are reading a story and learning the technique at the same time. I found I was not able to put the book down and read the whole thing in one sitting. In the end, I was able to explain the basic principles to others because they stuck with me. I find the story approach is much easier to follow and then retain then if I had tried to read a textbook or \"how to\".\n\nKudos to the author on this one!",
    "This book provider great insights and recommendations to creating a high performing management team, for anyone responsible for managing others.",
    "Nugget size action steps and notes are practical and very relevant. Will probably read a second time to fully immerse myself to effectively execute with my team. Will definitely recommend to my peers.",
    "I'm not a big fan of management books because they tend to get long-winded, technical, and impractical. This book is none of the three.\n\nI did not read the original book \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable\" (240 pages), but with this field guide, you don't need to read it. The field guide is 180 pages of easy reading. It's not complicated, very practical, and you don't need to be a CEO to implement the concepts.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this book to anyone who labors in futility on a fumbling team. It's worth your time.",
    "This is a great little book and an easy read. I recommend it for anyone leading a team or training leaders.",
    "I used to run high performance teams for a living and when I read the novel, I knew Lencioni was on to something, so I also bought the workbook. He nails it! Build trust and buy in and then create open, vulnerable, radically honest team debate. Powerful action and true results stem from this foundation.\n\nA practical book that can help any business create a true team, which sad to say in business, is a very rare occurrence.\n\nThe secret is to build a team from the bottom up and not the top down. It's a pyramid thing!",
    "This concise field book is bursting with hints and tips for building effective teams.\n\nPatrick's \"Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" was instrumental in opening my eyes to the symptoms and root causes of dysfunctional teams. Now, this deceptively small field book has helped me understand the practical steps I could take to resolve the root causes of poor teamwork in my organisation.\n\nThe wealth of experience distilled into this book is staggering. As I have applied the suggested tools with my team, they have responded in many of the ways Patrick has encountered with other teams. That has bolstered my confidence and enthusiasm to push through some very difficult discussions.\n\nYou'll need lots of courage and determination to build a great team, but with this book you'll have access to Patrick's knowledge, experience, enthusiasm and sense of fun.\n\nThank you Patrick for taking time to answer so many questions raised by \"Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" and proving a tremendously helpful set of tools and advice.",
    "Whilst not as widely taught in classrooms, Patrick Lenconi has a very vivid and engaging style. This guide is to be considered as an expansion to his Five Dysfunctions of a Team book.\n\nWhere is has use is the setting out of ideas and activities that can be used to guide a group of people and turn them into a more effective team. There are alternatives which can be used depending on circumstances, or even to continue growth.\n\nWhere it could be criticised is in the lack of depth of different alternatives to enable usage where a variety of approaches are needed.\n\nOverall this is a very useful guide to take the lessons from the book and use them to make a positive difference within your team.",
    "I build teams for a living and bought this to see if I could do anything different. It's a solid book and the author has been generous with his insight.",
    "For anyone working as an executive coach, a change management consultant or as an internal change agent in a larger organisation this is a very useful \"how to\" guide to enabling leadership teams to understand themselves as individuals and as a group. The tools outlined in the book are well-grounded in both practical experience and mainstream psychology. Above all the approach is practical and realistic. Good stuff."

    "I've read both of Anna's first two books ( Forex For Beginners  and  A Complete Guide To Volume Price Analysis ) back to back, and I'm going to be lazy and just post the same review for both, but I'll distinguish where I make comments specifically about one or the other.\n\nI'll start with a little background to put this review in context. I started getting interested in forex trading with an email touting some guy that had a \"system.\" I signed up for his live webcam \"learn how by watching me trade\" membership, figuring I'd take advantage of the 3-month money back guarantee if I learned nothing. At 2 months I couldn't explain his system clearly to myself, and he was changing methods almost every day and frequently seeming to contradict things he'd said before. I kept at it for another couple weeks and then used the money back guarantee. I then started downloading and backtesting all kinds of indicators and EAs and browsing Amazon reviews looking for a better guide. Next I scanned a couple forex books and a couple on trading in general, and I used  Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications (New York Institute of Finance)  as an encyclopedia. I continued playing with my practice account for a couple months, but could find nothing that worked consistently enough to be comfortable committing real money, and I lost interest.\n\nA year or so later I ran across an article about Richard Dennis and the 'Turtle Traders'. I realized: a) people do make money doing these things, b) anyone can learn the methods, c) and there are experts out there who are willing to share their knowledge. I started looking for a good book again and almost immediately found Anna's books. Forex for Beginners was so cheap and the free sample indicated it would be an easy read. Halfway through, and also after reading comments about it on several forums, I was sold on VPA. I decided to re-open my FXCM practice account and try some of her recommendations, then read the next book (A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis) while waiting for my account to fund. She recommends not using a practice account for anything more than learning the interface, for several reasons: real money is more meaningful and lessons stick better, the practice account feed is usually not a real live feed even if they say it is, and the practice feed won't show you the sudden spikes in the spread caused by your broker sometimes taking advantage of a fast moving market. Forex for Beginners was very helpful in explaining how the different types of forex brokers' operations can work against your interests if you have the wrong type of broker, and how to find the right type so you're not betting against the house.\n\nVolume price analysis makes sense to me, and her (and others') assertions that the market is controlled by insiders whose moves can be seen by analyzing volume is the best explanation I've seen yet for why price action forms certain consistent patterns. My previous concept of technical analysis was that specific price patterns form when there are enough people who believe it will, simply a self-fulfilling prophecy, and I could never quite accept that as a reliable way to make money. Now I understand how volume affects candle formation, and how insider action is reflected in volume, and it's all logical. I can trade on that with confidence, which is the biggest thing I've gotten from these two books.\n\nMy only complaint about both books is that she could use a more attentive editor, but there's nothing so bad it's really distracting. I read a review here recently where the reader said the grammar was so bad he/she couldn't finish the book (I can't remember if it was one of these two or another trading book). That's short-sighted arrogance in my opinion. The most eloquent speaker or the most concise and grammatically correct writer is not usually the best teacher. Also, if Anna had a talented editor go over this with a fine-toothed comb, yes it would be slightly easier to read, a little less repetitious, and probably a little shorter, but it would be more expensive too. If you want to learn how to work on your own Harley, the Haynes manual was written by a professional technical writer with a professional photographer looking over his shoulder at the work of a professional mechanic. Yet they (or their editors) still usually leave out all sorts of important details and perspectives that the grizzled old greasemonkey down at the shop is willing to give you if respect his experience and can dodge his tobacco juice and parse his colorful language. The Haynes manual is certainly cleaner and easier to read, but I'd prefer a conversation with the veteran any time.\n\nAnother reviewer for one of these books said they couldn't make out the charts in the Kindle version so they bought a print copy and it was no better. I agree some of them are pretty hard to read on my Kindle (6\" E-Ink display), but I had no problem with any of them on my iPhone screen or on Kindle Reader for PC.\nTip: I found it very helpful to read on my Kindle with my iphone in my lap above it so I could glance at the chart and back to the text without scrolling back and forth constantly - something Amazon could definitely improve in the Kindle experience.\n\nI gave A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis 4 stars when I started writing this review, but I've decided to make it 5 stars. Part of the reason for this upgrade is that I'm not aware of another book on VPA (or VSA), and I'm grateful to Anna for writing one. Also, I haven't put her recommendations to use yet. My next step is to go through the VPA book again and condense the principles onto a set of flash cards. Then I'll start with the smallest possible lot size (like she recommends), keep a journal, and mark up my flash cards as I go along. I'll update this review when I feel like I've got some meaningful experience.",
    "As an intermediate trader, I often felt nervous when entering a trade...mostly because I was unsure about the price action and whether the trade really had the steam to continue the trend or reverse the trend. Understanding volume was the missing, yet critical, piece to really master my understanding of the charts. My trading has improved exponentially as a result of the tools provided in the book. It is a must read for anyone who takes trading seriously.",
    "I think the author wins money and knows what she is talking about. I like to give this book 5 stars. But I didn't make any money follow the method. I have great respect for the author. I want to sit by her and see how she trade. But from this book. I kept loosing money. I think the author has good intention but something is missing in this book. That is support and resistance and timeframe. I think that's what missing in the analysis. She emphasize too much on volume. When in reality, when I see volume spike up the sell or buy has already begun. I'm too late to jump in. Plus, if she is talking about 1 minute time frame to see a spike in volume to get in the trade, then I would understand. But in this book she talk about any timeframe would work. When in reality, the 4 hours timeframe volume spike is already too late for the ride. I'm still lost and confused. I got a Kindle version by the way, it's has color chart because I use a tablet. I hope that her method would work for me so I can give a 5 star reviews. But it seem I keep loose money all the time. When there is a sell, there may or may not be any volume spike. What needs to be in this book is explaination on support and resistance and time-frames. Why people sell at certain support and resistance and how to spot them. From a guy who consistently loosing money. Volume reveals nothing more than an activity in the market.",
    "Excellent book. Full of pertinent information delivered in an engaging manner.",
    "Great information, I used some of the information in this book for trading options on SPY highly recommended as it sheds more light on TA and a tool to improve your chances in the markets",
    "TLDR: Read this. You will avenge your losses, and more.\n\nA powerfully educational book. I honestly feel one giant leap closer to understanding these enigmatic markets. Anomalies are actually scary now, and the thought about dark pools is disturbing. However, light has been shed on many, many objects in a once dark room. What's especially eye opening is I didnt know how dark the room was, and how many objects were in it. Think Plato's allegory of the cave... Without reading this book, you are in a cave without knowing how dark and how large. Outside, the stars literally await. I will say it takes about 2 days after reading to really soak in, so don't give up, Anne Coulling will change your career for the better on an incredibly necessary topic. She is definitely on Mount Rushmore of teachers, trading, and volume. You too can understand the market, just click buy already. Backtest her advice, scroll through the volume on your charts, dont be afraid to get rid of the indicators, its okay, just read this book and work towards your dreams and goals, you can do it. Thank you Anne Coulling, the companion book will be investigated as well. Thank you.",
    "First off, the insight delivered in Anna’s book is invaluable. As others have said the charts are a little hard to read and I saw a few typos, but that didn’t matter to me because the actual knowledge gained propelled my trading forward by leaps and bounds. Highly recommend",
    "Anna makes some great points. VPA makes sense but I'm not 100% convinced. Candlesticks coupled with volume can help in predicting the following price movement - up or down. Though the book is very repetitive! It could have been half the size.\nThe recurring references to the insiders have given me lots of confusion trying to explain every volume anomaly as being insiders work. Yes there is manipulation but I don't want to analyse each candlestick in terms of insiders manipulation. And it felt like the book was communicating, that. After 2-3 chapters then Anna says I don't mean that all price movement is manipulated. Oh ok, thanks God... because I was going nuts...\n\nAlso the last two chapters that consist of examples are unreadable because you can't actually read grey scale charts - also the images are too small to read such detailed charts. Even in colour it would have been difficult to read.\nI think the result would have been better if the author had used a white background in the charting software and black and white candlesticks (with a black outline).\n\nAlso Anna explains Volume at Price which I found really interesting.\nI've enjoyed a lot the references to old times traders.\n\nTo summarize:\n- the author is highly respected and I've really enjoyed Anna's book Forex for beginners - also printed in gray scale though...\n- the concept of VPA is interesting\n- the book is badly written although I believe Anna has had the best of intentions to explain everything thoroughly. She has gone way too far with the repetitions...\n- The last chapters are very difficult to read - to be honest I've quit trying\n- not my favorite... but I highly recommend Forex for Beginners by the same author.",
    "I was not impressed by this book at all. There is not enough substantiated information, lacks extensive charts to prove or back-test the theory, this is very weak and not useful. The theory of volume bars doesn't work at all i am not sure by reading this book what the strategy really is, as you need to look at what is going to happen, looking at what has happened is of little use with volume. Also repeats itself on multiple occasions.",
    "I bought this book in kindle and paper back. The book images are unreadable without the electronic form. However, even the chart images in the electronic form are really bad, low resolutions, wicks are missing in black background along with any other detail like date and pricing. Really pity because the content is good.",
    "after first reading the book, I had to return to certain chapters like volume at price to really grasp the significance this has in support and resistance.\nThe book is different to Tom William's book which explains volume spread analysis or vsa. Mrs Couuling defines volume price analysis using the candlestick chart patterns as opposed to hlc bars. There is a significant difference in this.\nI thank the author for assisting me in this approach and would urge those with little or no understanding of this subject to purchase a copy, which is certainly not a 'ripoff' or con as some negative reviewers have stated.",
    "After a few chapters I found validation in two charts I was invested in. Im rather pleased that not everyone seems to get value out of this book...\n\nIt seem odd to me that people dont, given its the price of a cpl of pints! Sometimes wordy and the student in me immediately wants to create an abbreviated cheatsheet to commit the patterns and rules to memory, but she is highly experienced and it comes through.\n\nVery helpful for my type of swing trading and another powerful tool in the toolbox to assess position size and entry timing.\n\nGet it!"

    "I’m 25 years old and this book is very helpful when it comes to having a guide on how to be financially free. This book is a must need for all black girls getting out of high school or 18! If I had this back then I would’ve felt more prepared when it came to my finances now. However, I can say that this book prompts you to think about things from a different perspective and the details on how how to get started on a financially free life is just Amazing! Just go get the book!",
    "Haven’t finished the book but it’s good so far. It really is something that should have been given to my younger self (I’m in my mid 20’s now). The world has failed us in teaching young minorities, especially women the steps needed to reach financial freedom. The amount of debt I have now, is ridiculous- many it appears, could have been avoided.",
    "I don’t even want to put it down! These books just got delivered today and I’ve already read them both! These have educated me and changed my mindset on so many things!",
    "If only I had this knowledge in my earlier years. But my current case is “better late than never”. This book came to me during a time of my life where I was finally getting a hold of my financial situation. I had accomplished a long standing goal of paying off my credit cards and wanted to further learn about financial freedom. I am grateful to have stumbled across this book for through it I have gained the knowledge to take my goals to the next level thank you Paris!!!!",
    "Perfect and relatable book for someone who is just beginning to understand their own finances. Easy to read and follow along as well.",
    "Everything mentioned is very beneficial to helping Black women save money. I adored Paris' writing and knowledge.",
    "This is a very thoughtfully and carefully written book that contains everything people should know about personal finance. Highly recommended to both Black women or anyone interested in learning more about managing personal finances.",
    "Ms. Woods has a very authentic way of connecting with her audience as she takes them on a journey into some difficult aspects of their lives. I truly enjoyed learning from her experiences, and the way she seeks to empower women to get real about the changes they need to make in their lives of they want to create wealth. Being debt free is just one aspect of generating wealth. Ms. Woods encourages her readers to do some soul searching and evaluating to create a vision and plan for the life they want to lead. This was not easy for me, but I'm excited to do the work thanks to Ms. Woods guidance and real life examples."

    "This book was especially helpful to me as I came up on my 20 year high school reunion. I was telling a friend that I didn't feel accomplished enough. I'm always hitting a goal and then setting the bar higher. This book was a great reminder that we should measure backwards and spend time in the GAINS!",
    "This book helped me frame my past and heal from negative experiences. I now find myself saying “I’m in the GAP” if I start down a spiral of feeling sorry for myself. I’ve realized that I have so many GAINS and more coming in the future.",
    "Measure not how far you have to go, but how far you’ve been.\n\nIt’s a “glass half full” idea - but an easy to understand application for how to enjoy the successes (and failures) we all have.",
    "This is one of the best books I’ve ever read!",
    "I found this book truly inspiring. I think many of us focus on the gaps in our lives and end up missing out in many precious moments and experiences. This book is empowering because it shows you how you can actually turn everything around and make it a winning situation for yourself. It’s really freeing to think that we can control situations by changing our perspective. I highly recommend this book!",
    "A must read for every ambitious professional. It helps you avoid the side effects of hard working and persistence while maintaining a good quality of life we all need.",
    "A nice book about perspective and some basics of how to change - and realizing the need to. Quick read.",
    "The past is your foundation to your future. Don’t run away from it. Make peace and embrace yourself forward. Sometimes moving forward is required only when you look back.",
    "I'd done some other reading on the 'Gap and the Gain concept' elsewhere and figured I had it sussed as I started to use it the moment I understood the basics. I hesitated over buying the book because others - like the 5 second Rule really are several hundred pages of filler. Not this one. Every example and line expands the core concepts and when I get to the idea of coming from 'Wanting' rather than 'Needing'. Well, drop the mic. Something really clicked from me and although the concept wasn't new tome - the way the author explained it was and I got it. Totally got it. I will update this review as I go but I can't wait to read the rest. The concept of gap and gain is easily as important as Carol Dweck's growth mindset and is due to bring untold relief to suffering millions. An exageration? Read for yourself and find out. Thank you for this wonderful gift and anyone who doesn't believe a shift in frames can change their outlook for the better - should stilll read this.",
    "Life rarely exactly matches our ideal goals and outcomes and it is always easy to focus on the fact that we did not achieve our ideal but all that this results in is unhappiness, frustration, disappointment and other negative feelings.\n\nThis is a problem because we use the future as our projection and use that to measure our progress even though it is not reality. If you started last in a race and got to second position but your ideal was coming first then would you actually measure your real progress which was going from last to second or would you measure with an ideal and say I did not make it to the top position?\n\nThis book does a great job of bringing to life how we think about progress and categorises them as the GAP or the GAIN. The GAP is where people measure progress based on ideals whilst the GAIN is where people look back and actually measure the distance they have travelled, the outcomes they have achieved and appreciate the gains made.\n\nWhilst this book will be super useful for Entrepreneurs and High Achievers, in actual sense, it would be useful for everyone. Having read the book I now appreciate why BJ Fogg who is the author of Tiny Habits has made this as a required reading for all his Stanford courses.\n\nSome of the concepts around needs and wants, success criteria, mental subtraction, journaling to measure backwards, measuring daily wins and proactive gratitude are amongst many other powerful concepts that will provide you with a practical framework to be in the GAIN and create life changing results.\n\nWhat I Love about this book is that everything in there has a practical use and can directly support you with changing the mindset from GAP to GAIN. Ben has made the concepts easy to understand with some great examples, every chapter ending with a summary and very clear ideas on what to do practically to live that concept.\n\nIt is a book I will be recommending to everyone I know. It is a short book, so investing about 4 hours of your life will give you practical wisdom that can help create significant shifts in many areas of your life.",
    "I enjoyed this book, and it resonated with me so much, as soon as I finished it, I flipped it over and started again.\n\nIf you have ever felt frustrated that you are not achieving your goals, read this book to gain a whole new perspective on achievement.\n\nThe concept is so simple, and yet there are hidden depths to how we all choose to live in either the Gap or the Gain.",
    "This is a great book. Another one from the strategic coach . It’s a life changing book. Benjamin and Dan make a great team and I am willing to bet that the next one will even be better and bigger . Applying the principles here will transform your life completely and totally.",
    "The only book I have listen [audible] to twice! i LOVE the conversation Ben Hardy has with Dan Sullivan that are woven in, they bring the ideas/methodology to life.\n\nI've been recording my 'gains' each day - and it is transforming the way I think, feel and act and moving me to a new way of being - my future self!"

    "Book arrived fine. I bought the previous version in error and it came with the code but this one did not.",
    "I believe this accounting book is excellent for the detail that is provided for each subject. However the amount of detail can be the problem, especially for the way it can be presented sometimes. The concepts are sometimes explained in very complex ways, instead of using more easy to understand definitions or explanations. Trying to figure out the example problems can sometimes turn out to be a hassle, flipping to several pages and hoping to make connections. Sometimes the numbers that are chosen within the examples within the chapter are such a bad choice, that when trying to find where certain numbers come from, you find that the same 1,000,000 comes from three different spots. I do have to give this book some credit, there is a lot of effort put into it, and the knowledge is all there.",
    "The book is the correct edition and opens on Kindle properly. This is where the good part of the review ends: the pages consistently skip to the next one with no prompt. The book resizes itself randomly and at the most inconvenient times. What I mean by that is I have it set to \"fit to width\" or 400% and when I'm taking notes or doing homework the page will just resize itself to 100%, which I can't see at all. If I'm going to highlight something or write down a sentence from page 4 - 5, suddenly without clicking anything I'm on page 4 - 6, and then 4 - 7. I click back to the original page and right as I'm about to start writing it DOES IT AGAIN. I've tried re-downloading the book, reinstalling the Kindle app, everything. No other book does this. No matter what device I use, it does this. If you're reading this, trust me, don't buy the kindle version. It will cost you much, much more money when you throw your computer out the window from frustration.\n\nAgain, seriously, what an awful digital book. I can't possibly encourage you enough to NOT buy this.",

    "This textbook does not do a good job at providing examples and the explanations for a lot of concepts in this book and are worded in the worst possible way. Instead of making an already difficult subject more accessible to students, this text does the complete opposite. You'll find that if examples do exist they are almost impossible to comprehend as the language and style of this book takes already complex concepts and make them even more complex. Also the homework provided through Wiley is absolutely nothing like you will find in the book. I've had to resort to using another textbook for most of my classes rather than this one. It seems the author and publisher don't seem to understand that this text needs a serious revision on how to explain concepts in a more clear, simplistic, and concise manner.",

    "California author Tom McCarthy is a corporate consultant, speaker, trainer, coach, and educator – teaching people how to increase their level of performance in business and in life by using his Breakthrough Code, a technique he now shares in this new book. He is the founder of Thomas McCarthy & Associates – a training and consulting firm with an impressive clientele.\n\nTom is a gifted storyteller and he wisely uses that talent to present the concepts of his book in story format. He presents his advice through ‘the journey of a young boy, Jonathan, who has big dreams and ambitions. Jonathan's promising start after college quickly turns to overwhelm, struggling to succeed at work and finding himself in a situation where both his relationship and his health are failing. Feeling down on his luck, Jonathan turns to a friend of his deceased father, Mr. Woodberry, for advice. Mr. Woodberry introduces Jonathan to The Breakthrough Code. Through a series of stories, characters, trials, and tribulations, Jonathan starts to see his life improving. He finds himself happier, healthier and creating breakthroughs in every area of his life. Jonathan's career, relationships, and life all begin to shift for the better. But what changed? Throughout the journey, Jonathan learns how to apply The Breakthrough Code. He learns that his life was being held back by the story he was telling himself and his subconscious beliefs.’ “Think of the recognition of others’ challenges as the gateway to living your purpose and achieving your Breakthrough Result.’\n\nThe keys to the Breakthrough Code are condensed as follows: First Big Idea - Focus on Less, then Obsess: Choose your Breakthrough Result - See It, Feel It, Believe It, and Let It Go. Second Big Idea – Upgrade your story, Upgrade your life: Get rid of your old baggage, Third Big Idea – Pack your day with effective actions: Create your network of empowerment, Invest in yourself, create a fortress of Focus. After the ‘near memoir’ story, Tom shares his life in a manner that underscores the points that are so well presented in the Jonathan/Mr. Woodberry tale, and absorbing his advice results in personal growth for the reader. This is an excellent and unique self-help book – highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 22",
    "The Breakthrough Code is that kind of book we all wish to have read during our college or university times. After graduating, we have dreams and goals that overwhelm us and we start questioning whether we are prepared to deal with those objectives. This book helps readers to achieve them, through a “code” and no matter how big your goals are, you can get what you want easier and\nfaster.\nThe story is told in the form of a parable, with a young boy, Jonathan, as the main protagonist, who has big dreams and ambitions and his\nlife changes after learning about the Breakthrough Code. This character represents us all, young or not, who wish to live without limits. So I guess that feeling identified with him has helped me understand this book’s concept and acquire more tools to keep living my life in a more positive manner. What a read!",
    "I loved Tom's approach to sharing 'information' by presenting it as a story. This really broadens both... the 'meaning' any individual can receive from the reading, and...... speaks much more directly to the many levels of our beingness.......heart and emotions, as well as 'mind'.\n\nFor myself, as a very 'other' oriented person.....it was especially good to realize the importance of 'creating a fortress of fous' :-)\n\nI've known for some time that it is rarely what 'happens' to us that shapes an event's impact on our lives nearly as much as the 'story' and meaning, we give to that experience, (and response we choose ). This book grows that understanding in multiple, very helpful ways.\n\nThank you Tom !",
    "I love how this story is written as a work of fiction, though it's expressed through stories and examples that are truly useful to implement in the everyday lives of normal people. While failure is a scary thing and can often stray us away from reaching our full potential, the stories shared with Jonathan by Mr. Woodberry show the possibilities that are endless as long as we are determined and keep the fear from stopping us. This one is a fairly simple read but one that will definitely allow you to walk away with a sense of inspiration and hope for the future. This is the perfect read for someone looking for an energizing boost for their future.",
    "Tom McCarthy, author of “The Breakthrough Code: A Story About Living A Life Without Limits”, created a reading that is insightful and very interesting. This modern parable helps you imagine what you can create when you meet big results. Putting into practice what is learnt with this book can help us reach our goals, something most of us desire.\nThe book is clear, well written and interesting. I would recommend reading it and take the most of it. The author has done a great job putting his expertise and knowledge in these pages.",
    "Highly recommend for anyone looking to create a better life for themselves",
    "I really enjoyed reading this book, and it has energized me to work toward achieving breakthrough results in my life. The idea that you can't just work harder to achieve breakthroughs resonated with me. In the parable, the main character is struggling until his mentor teaches him The Breakthrough Code: 3 big ideas and supporting habits for each one. It's a fairly quick read, but I connected with the story. The author also provides a code with your purchase granting free access to his video masterclass which further explains the concepts and helps you work toward achieving your breakthrough results. I liked the book so much, I've already bought two more copies to share with someone on my team at work and my wife.",
    "Great book about how to navigate life and business. So many wonderful tips on how to go to the next level. This is a book I will revisit for years to come.",
    "Believe in you",
    "Yes this is a coaching book. Attached is master class, really fun and interesting. So if you get to read it take the time for the application after. Game changing and positive.",

    "The book was billed for children BUT it is advanced. However, the book presents an excellent overall view of investing. If you want to spend time with your children going through the concepts presented, it is worth the time. It has a conflict with the images (cartoon like) versus the advanced material. This book could be a first textbook for high school level and beyond. It is extremely well presented for older children and adults. My husband will use it to teach our Grandboys about investing. They are 7 and 10 and it would be too hard for this age level without adult help.",

    "This book is good to help you to remember to prioritize what is important and organize your life around the priorities. I always have enjoyed her books",
    "This book is divided into three parts, with a total of eleven chapters and about 260 pages, not including the appendix, workbook, and notes.\n\nIn the Introduction, Oster explains that her experience as an economics professor at the University of Chicago allowed her to see similarities between the advice she gave her students about running a business, and the framework needed to make family decisions and run her household. With two school age children of her own, she began to find it useful to approach family decisions in a similar manner to the decisions you make when running a business.\n\nPart One – The Family Toolbox, starts to create a basic framework for deciding how you want to run your family. The first step is establishing The Big Picture, and deciding what things are most important to you and your family. Oster then identifies a process of decision making she calls “The Four F's”: Frame the Question, Fact-Find, Final Decision, Follow-Up. This section wraps up with some basic workplace tools to help keep things organized.\n\nPart Two – Big Data, focuses on general data that is helpful to consider when making your Big Picture family plan. This section has chapters on sleep, childcare, nutrition and different parenting styles.\n\nPart Three – The Data Studies, deals with data that is more specific, dealing with individual choices that you will have to make. There are chapters on school choices, extracurricular activities, feelings, and entertainment. The end of the book also has some notes, and a handy Workbook, which has great blueprints for identifying the important priorities, and charts for scheduling your week.\n\nOverall I found this book to be an informative, helpful guide for making important decisions. I really like the inclusion of the Workbook at the end, as it helps to organize your priorities and create a routine. I think that anything that helps parents make better, more informed decisions is a valuable tool; so this book is probably worth reading if you have children.",
    "I’m a big Emily Oster fan. However, I found this book to be boring, obvious common sense and not very helpful.",
    "I am a huge Emily Oster fan and this book did not disappoint. It starts out sounding like a business strategy book, applied to family life and makes a good case for thinking about things that way. Unlike a typical business strategy book, most of the rest of the book is spent introducing new information and data, and only briefly mentions Professor Oster's strategies in a few applications after that. I've found that most books of this type are extremely repetitive and don't require the reader to actually finish them to get the full benefit. Not so here! Family Firm was informative and enlightening until the very end. I highly recommend this book.",
    "I heard about Emily Oster when my sister in law bought me Expecting Better. I also subscribe to her newsletter so I was excited when this book came out.\n\nI really enjoy her writing style, the way she explains things and how she can make me feel less crazy in this world of parenting.\n\nThe Family Firm has helped me so much. It's not a book that will tell you what to do but will guide you in how to breakdown a decision. This book doesn't feel like an \"expert\" giving you information, it feels more personal as if you are reading something from someone you know. Anyway, just buy this book!",
    "The Family Firm provides data and a little direction, miraculously instilling parents with the confidence necessary to make the best decisions for their families. Oster’s personal anecdotes are endearing and illustrative. I gift Expecting Better to new parents regularly, as it was so helpful for me as a new mom. I will be gifting the Family Firm now, too. There is a lot of uncertainty in parenting and, as a control freak, Oster’s work eases my anxiety and helps me prepare for anything.",
    "This is a good book. It might have been the case that after reading Cribsheet my expectations were very high, but I was slightly disappointed. I understand there is not enough data on many issues when kids are older, but this felt like the author was giving advice rather than providing the data for me to make decisions",
    "As with her other books, the best thing about Oster is she doesn’t preach or tell you what to do, she simply presents information that’s relevant to whatever stage of parenthood you’re in in a smart, distilled manner so you can make an informed decision. The added bonus of The Family Firm is her roadmap for decision making - my oldest child is 4 and we are grappling with school entry and extracurricular questions and the way she empowers parents to think about decisions that will impact their family is super helpful and honestly would be relevant to ANY family. I feel like I’m going to parent in a smarter, more confident way because of this book. Thanks Emily Oster as always!",
    "Discovered Emily Oster via my US-based brother and sister-in-law and have delighted in her substack in recent months, spanning covid and parenting couched in the comforting embrace of economic-style-data-nerdery.\n\nOn my brother's recommendation I read this book, which I found a lot of fun, even for those of us on this side of the pond. If you can get past the Americanisms (both linguistic - middle school, firm, etc) and cultural (I have yet to meet a Brit who calls a family meeting a family meeting, but maybe that's my circle) it's a wonderful hodgepodge of aggregated data (research on children's school, sleep, eating, extra-curricular activity, leisure time, holiday camp, bullying, even parenting styles) - which is reassuring... then filtered through Prof Oster's lived experience.\n\nFavourite example (paraphrased): \"what age should children get their first phone? 12. But for more nuance, read on...\" --> and from (in this case) the lack of data, she extrapolates to intuitive, logical reasoning of the whys and wherefores of different parenting choices.\n\nMost of all, her four 'F' - framing, fact-finding, final decision & follow up - highlights how poorly we tend to communicate as families, over big decisions and small, and how useful a consistent framework could be, for kids and parents alike.\n\nThat said, the eponymous tenet of the book - that families should run like businesses - isn't actually a strong narrative thread outside the first few chapters. Yes, good, clear, considerate comms is important in a family. So are tools for managing busy lives. Other than that, it's not too heavy, so don't let that put you off.\n\nThe fact that Prof Oster plays Taylor Swift's 'Shake it off' on repeat at high volume to help her cope with her own insecurities differentiates it from many other parenting books in its humanity as much as her heft as an academic and her meticulous collation of the research on parenting.",
    "To me, the book is a great sequel of Oster's two earlier books; but as most sequels it differs from the earlier ones (and Oster is really frank on this): The earlier books were packed with findings on very specific questions - almost a handbook. Family Firm is much more about how to approach problems giving some illistrative applications.\n\nIf you read the earlier books, you might want to ask yourself what you liked about them. Lots of findings on very specific questions that are directly applicable to your life? Family Firm is probably not right for you. Clear, data-driven and businesslike approach to parenting that you would like to follow yourself? Go for Family Firm.",
    "Not as data rich as the previous two books, but as the author said: there isn't much to go through at later stages, so having a decision and planning framework is a great idea.\n\nAlthough some of the collectivistic ideas of the author do surface unnecessarily:\n\nA must read!",
    "I’m only half way through and I’m already in love with this book. As someone who’s always looking for a thoughtful and intentional way to approach problems - I love it. This book is really helping us to create a consistent way to approach family decision making that aligns with our own personal values."

    "This was the shortest of Lencioni leadership fables that I have read, but it still packs a powerful point. I found the later part of the book the most helpful. There, Lencioni unpacks the principle that is driven home by the interaction between the two CEOs in his story. Anyone who is in leadership and works with a team should find this book helpful and challenging.",
    "The reasons behind peoples' motivation for obtaining a position in leadership are two fold; you see it as a reward to yourself, or you see it as a privilege to serve others. We may flow in and out of these motivations but it comes down to your ultimate motive for why you are striving for a leadership role.\n\nIn Patrick Lencioni's latest book The Motive, he delivers a concentrated version of how those two motives look in action, what the results of a reward mentality look like, and what we can do to make sure we are in it for the right reasons.\n\nLencioni is one of my most favorite authorities on organizational health. He has introduced me to some fantastic perspectives that have helped me to identify dysfunctions of a team as well as the qualities that identify the ideal team player.\n\nThis was a very quick read, but had a lot of substance! Read it and do some introspective work to find out if your ideals are lining up with your efforts...or lack thereof.",
    "I recently heard Patrick Lencioni give a speech about his latest book: The Motive: Why So Leaders Abdicate Their Most Important Responsibilities and immediately the book!  It is, by far, his shortest book with the main premise centered around the \"why\" one chooses to be a leader.  Is it for the glory, prestige, or \"rewards\" for achieving the pinnacle of success OR is it for the responsibility of leading a successful organization?  Those \"reward- centered leaders\" believe they can pick and choose what they want to do, abdicating five core responsibilities that cannot be delegated:\n\n1. Developing the leadership team.  Often delegated to HR or an external consultant, the leader has to spend time developing their team members' interpersonal dynamics and collective behaviors.\n2. Managing subordinates.  We are not talking about micromanaging highly paid executives!  The leader needs to set the general direction of the work ensuring that it is aligned with and understood by their peers and stay informed enough to identify potential obstacles and problems as early as possible.  And the leader needs to make sure their subordinates one level below are managing their people too.\n3. Having difficult and uncomfortable conversations.  While having difficult conversations is certainly one part of managing a team and subordinates,  the leader must confront difficult, awkward issues and behaviors quickly and with clarity, charity and resolve. Left unaddressed, these issues eventually degrade the organization's performance.\n4. Running great team meetings.  Meetings are one of the most unpopular and underestimated activities in business.  Yet this is where leaders make critical decisions and set the tone for all of the meetings within the organization.  If team meetings are boring and a chore to get through, the fault rests squarely on the leaders' lap!\n5. Communicating constantly and repetitively to employees.  Just because a leader has expressed themselves once or twice, doesn't mean that people heard it or understand it.  Employees have to hear a consistent message at least seven times before they believe executives are serious about it.  Leaders need to have a consistent drumbeat - and if they get bored saying the same thing, they need to get creative in their messaging.\n\nThese five areas are not a list of the key responsibilities of the leader of an organization (that would be in his book, The Advantage), yet they are good reminders of specific situations and responsibilities that leaders avoid all too often.",
    "You can finish the book in one sitting. The basic idea is that leadership must have a goal that is bigger than itself. You should lead an organization to achieve something that is worthwhile and not for selfish reasons. Very well articulated.",
    "I have served in non-profits for 25 years, and I can testify that what Patrick is teaching WORKS. When direct reports know you have their back and when you make sure you're caring for them personally, they will give their best for you.\n\nThis book really resonated with me because this kind of \"servant leadership\" that Patrick Lencioni describes is how Jesus led His disciples. Patrick's principles could have all had Scripture references to back them up—so I wasn't surprised to see him give credit to Jesus in the acknowledgements.\n\nPatrick wrote: \"Most leaders today don’t generally see their role as a privilege or a duty. They see it as a right and a reward\" (pp. 130-131, Kindle Edition). Jesus said it this way: “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them. But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant; and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (Mark 10:42–45)\n\nI have a card on my desk with the question written: \"What is your motive?\" I try to read it often and refocus my reasons for doing what I do.",
    "Gave a copy to each of my grandsons who are college juniors. They are both beginning to know what leadership is about. This book will help give them some more perspective.",
    "Simple yet sound advice for how to lead your team and organization should be obvious but points covered are often overlooked or underestimated",
    "Enjoyed the storybof two CEOs and their journey. The reward vs responsibility centred leadership is a great question, and one that proviedes a challenge and hallmark for many to stop and assess.",
    "This book is quite simply excellent. It provides a simple, yet highly effective frame to view the motivation behind leaders. He has not met a leader that I am currently working with, I am sure, but this book is all about him!\nOne of your best Pat, thank you.",
    "A quick read",
    "Finished it within hours of arriving, very addictive and interesting. Have since ordered more of J-B Lencioni's books",
    "The world is in a very peculiar place. Much of what we see, hear and observe is through other's lens. We so need to form our own educated opinion on what is happening in the world and in our own leadership capacity. While this book is about leadership and maybe best said the why behind one's quest for leadership, what was so very poignant was within the last few pages. Anyone who is in a leadership position should read this book and examine their own motives for wanting to lead. I assure you it will be time well spent. Coach Simms."

    "Many books, including Talent is Overrated, Peak, Grit and Outliers have made the argument that hard work, persistence, deliberate practice, opportunity and a nurturing environment are among the reasons why people excel, not talent alone. In Mindset, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck adds another reason why some people thrive and achieve – they have a growth mindset.\n\nDweck proposes that human qualities are not carved in stone, they can be cultivated. People can grow and get better at anything, including sports, art, music, business, parenting or relationships. This includes intellectual skills. People can get smarter.\n\nSome people choose to believe their intelligence or ability is a static and deep-seated trait. This is the fixed mindset. Others choose to believe that intelligence and ability are traits you can develop. This is the growth mindset.\n\nIn the fixed mindset, because intelligence and ability are seen as static, this leads to a tendency to avoid challenges, see effort as fruitless, ignore useful feedback, feel threatened by the success of others, give up easily when obstacles arise, and get defensive and place blame for poor performance or failure. As a result, people with this mindset plateau early and achieve less than their full potential.\n\nIn the growth mindset, a person sees intelligence and ability as something that can be developed. This leads to a desire to learn, to embrace challenges, persist in the face of obstacles, see effort as the path to mastery and therefore work harder, learn from criticism and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. As a result, they reach even higher levels of achievement.\n\nMindset does not argue that success is a matter of either genes or environment, talent or hard work. It acknowledges that there’s a constant interaction between the two. The book also doesn’t propose that anyone can become anything – a Mozart or Einstein or Michael Jordan – if they simply work hard enough and long enough.\n\nHowever, Dweck does suggest that people are capable of much more than first meets the eye and there’s no way to know a person’s potential or predict what can be accomplished without trying and putting in the time and effort. Some of the most successful people in history had no obvious signs of talent when they started.\n\nThe book gives examples of fixed versus growth mindset in school, sports, business, relationships, and parenting so there’s value for coaches, athletes, students, teachers, parents, couples, managers, executives and employees. There’s an entire chapter devoted to business and another to sports, but the largest number of examples are related to education and learning.\n\nI believe the message in Mindset is an important one. I would rate this 5 stars for concept. I give it 4 for delivery. It’s filled with so many anecdotes I felt like it dragged in places and was a bit repetitive. I think this is the kind of subject that could be covered completely in a 20 minute TED talk. But if you’re interested in psychology, especially learning, mindsets, beliefs and the talent vs work or nature vs nurture debate, then you would enjoy reading this whole book cover to cover.",
    "I love this book such a great read and already recommended it to all the people I think should read it. The book was basically brand new and I would recommend to anyone and also that they buy it on Amazon.",
    "Finally! Real solutions for learning, rather than excuses for not learning. Actually achieve high expectations rather than sinking your expectations lower and lower.",
    "One of the greatest books I’ve ever read .. totally recommended if you want to change how you think so you can change your whole life.",
    "This book is an eye opener. It talked to me in several ways. I have always had problems learning new skills or fitting into new situations but I have always persisted.. Years after I enjoy a measure of success due to this trait and I have forgotten the struggles. Thank you",
    "I love the fact from research that support the explanation of the author. I don't agree with all aspect of this book, in my opinion something needs to be fixed in order to grow, the tree needs a fixed place (soil) or medium in order to grow. Some kind of thinking or believe need to be fixed and from there you can grow a mindset.\n\nMy point is in e to have a growth mindset you need to believe (core mindset) to something that makes you grow, and that believe need to be fixed, otherwise, you'll end up stop grow because your belief has changed to something fixed.\n\nBut, overall this book is spectacular, it has helped me a lot with a new way of thinking and new terminology to describe a kind of mindset.",
    "I had seen this book referenced many times in times in the past, and only recently I decided to buy it and read it. And it has been one of the quickest reads ever!\n\nThis book is a true gem. It helps the reader undermine the victim mentality to the core, and provides with many examples of the difference that having a fixed mindset has compared to the journey implied in having a growth mindset.\n\nWe all are a mix of both mindset, and it is up to us to recognize and control where we are in our life, and what is the dominant mindset. This book gives concrete action steps to take to chip at the fixed mindset, and to install the growth mindset mentality which is what makes us improve in all we do in our lives.\n\nBecause age and skills don’t matter when the right mindset, the growth mindset, is allowed to make us flourish.\n\nA must read, truly inspirational. And now it’s time to start the journey. Now.",
    "Very practical tools that you can apply daily. Lots of examples to understand the concepts. Structure of book easy to follow.",
    "Useful effort allows for learning and growth. Making effort useful requires a willingness to look at process and change what isn't working. Failure is a way of understanding that the effort wasn't useful and a tool to speed future progress.\n\nThis book has salient information for everyone but the delivery is so laboured, it's easy to miss. You can get the gist by reading the summary at the end of each chapter and speeding through the final chapter (8), skipping around 75%.\n\nDefinitely buy this book if:\n* you like your information delivered slowly in a narrative form and repeated\n* you have a big interest in US sports\n* you find social proof persuasive or motivating.\n\n\"How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big\" by Scott Adams would be a suitable replacement and is a much better investment of time.",
    "Not only did it help me transform how I approach thinking about problems in a transformatively more positive way, it's also enabled me to clearly identify how significant others throughout my life (parents, teachers, bosses, colleagues, friends) think (fixed or growth mindset), which has helped me find peace with the way they judge(d) me. This has helped me shift out of feeling responsible for the way I've been judged and I've already shed lots of negative beliefs I held about myself either as a result of the way others spoke to me, or the way in which I spoke to myself with negative self-talk. It's repetitive, which annoys some people, but get this book and read it anyway. You can always take a break from it and dive back in later, you won't be sorry.",
    "Wer an der Idee des \"growth mindset\" interessiert ist, sollte vorweg auf Youtube ein oder zwei entsprechende Videos von Frau Dweck anschauen - in denen sagt sie in wenigen Worten bereits alles Wesentliche. Der Wert dieses Buches liegt somit vor allem darin, dass es anhand von Beispielen das growth mindset systematisch erläutert. Zuerst erschien mir dies als zu oberflächlich, da ich mir mehr theoretischen Tiefgang erhofft hatte, allerdings ist es allgemein bekannt, dass Beispiele fürs Verständnis enorm wichtig und hilfreich sind. Insofern kann man von diesem Buch durchaus profitieren - wenn man ein Buch zu einem Thema gelesen hat, dann hat man es oft besser verinnerlicht als nach einem kurzen Video.\n\nWas mich etwas gestört hat: Ihr Buch beginnt Frau Dweck mit den Worten \"No book has ever explained this mindset and shown people how to make use of it in their lives.\" - das entspricht nicht der Realität. Von der Philosophie der Antike (besonders die Stoiker) über Nietzsche bis hin zu Psychologen wie Kazimierz Dabrowski: Das Gedankengut findet sich bereits bei vielen anderen Menschen und in vielen anderen Büchern, bloß sind diese nicht so modern und haben keinen griffigen Titel wie \"growth mindset\". Der Nobelpreisträger Santiago Ramón y Cajal meinte vor hundert Jahren schon: \"Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain.\" Das ist im Wesentlichen die Botschaft des Buches, deren Bedeutung dann durch viele Beispiele erläutert wird. Hier hätte ich mir wenigstens eine andeutungsweise historische Einordnung gewünscht.\n\nZusammenfassend: Wer sich mal einen Vortrag von Dweck angehört hat und lesen möchte, wie das growth mindset in verschiedenen Situationen konkret aussieht, um ein besseres Verständnis zu erlangen, der kann das Buch guten Gewissens kaufen. Man kann hier durchaus etwas lernen, auch wenn an Theorie vergleichen mit ihren TED Talks nicht so viel dazu kommt.",
    "Every now and again you come across a book that is not just interesting, informative, insightful or educational, and not just changes the way you think, but changes the way you see the world. Mindset takes you through a journey of the differences between a \"growth mindeset\" and \"fixed mindeset\" what that means and how you can make a difference.\nOr try and make a difference. In your work life, your personal life, how you deal with colleagues, your friends, family and your children. This book is not a \"tickbox\" or a \"top ten things you need to do\" and the reason for this, is that the change has to come from within you. This book purley is a catalyst to empower you to make that change. I've purchased a copy for all my friends for Christmas.",
    "A trusted friend told me this book changed her life, so I was excited about reading it. What powerful advice did the author have for me? Turns out, not much.\n\nThe central premise of the book is a statement of the obvious: You can get better at anything you like; it just requires effort, effective strategies and learning from setbacks. People who do this often out-perform people who have greater innate ability but do not apply effort, go through the motions and blame setbacks on others.\n\nThat’s it. The rest of the book is endless US-centric sporting anecdotes, written in the glib style of a 300-page LinkedIn post. Some parts really made me cringe: “The growth mindset gave me a mother”; “Parents who send fixed-mindset messages are like France, and parents who send growth-mindset messages are like Italy”; “If we do not learn and work hard, we will take an Icarian flight to nowhere” (the latter supposedly uttered by a four-year-old boy with a STRONG growth mindset).\n\nMy recommendation would be to read a one-page summary of this book online, then spend the time you would have spent reading the book studying “Learning to Learn” on Coursera, which provides much more insightful and practical advice about getting better at things in (dare I say it?) a growth-minded way."

    "Entrepreneurs are always \"crossing the chasm\", moving from \"good to great\", incorporating new \"atomic habits\" into their business, and so much more.\n\nIn this short work Mark C. Winters joins with Gino Wickman of Traction fame, make combining two entrepreneurial leaders at the top of an organization can provide the \"Rocket Fuel\" a business needs as one takes on the Visionary role and one the Integrator role.\n\nA lot of great takeaways from the book. Here's a \"Did you know\" from their learnings... there are fewer good Integrators out there that visionaries. Learn more in the book and gain some Rocket Fuel insights you can use.",
    "As an integrator, I found this book helpful in several ways:\n\n1. It gave me a better understanding of what both roles do and how they should function.\n2. It gave me clear next steps on what I should do for any organization.\n3. Gave me hope that we (V/I) can accomplish great things.",
    "At university you will learn how to manage a large business. From Gino Wickman you will learn how to manage a small to medium size business. I am hooked on his writings. I would suggest you start off with his book called Traction. This is a follow on to that book.\nEssential small business writings. Not just a book, a business manual.",
    "Great concepts but it could have been written in less pages. It also over simplifies the roles.",
    "It was nice to read and learn that I have a specific place and qualities that are rare and needed for every business. Being a very strong integrator type I have always assumed that I am lacking some specific skills for business - strong vision, creative product ideas or other qualities essential to build a company. Reading this book gave me a new perspective of a visionary and integrator duo, which puts me behind the tasks that I am really good at. Loved the practical tools and concise explanation to apply them. For sure a must read for everyone who wants to find solutions for their business efficiency.",
    "The authors describe a problem with many, if not most, entrepreneurs. They have wonderful ideas, lots of them. In the midst of implementing a phenomenal idea, a \"shiny silver object\" passes by, yet another phenomenal idea, tending to distract from the implementation process. They describe the what, why and the how to fix this problem. Not theoretically; with words, charts and rationale. A great read for almost all entrepreneurs!",
    "Creo que las organizaciones.tradicionales les puede ayudar mucho porque simplifica la forma de operar los negocios en la región de Latinoamérica",
    "Worth it!",
    "Simple concept, but it works! I’ve seen this work so well for many businesses now - I’m a headhunter specialising in finding ‘Integrators’ for Visionary’s who know they need help getting stuff done and driving growth to the next level. Gives them their lives back too (not having to waste so much time and energy on tasks they are not at all suited to).",
    "all good, great value, thank you",
    "I’m an Integrator (in Rocketfuel speak) working in a church organisation as the no. 2 to the visionary senior pastor. This has really helped explain our unique contributions and our differing perspectives on how we operate. Lots of homework to apply as a result.",
    "Anyone running your own business or dreaming of building up a business in the future this book is vital. This book was recommended by Carrie Green of She Means Business and Female Entrepreneur Association. Well worth a read.",
    "An interesting and worthy read but not revolutionary."

    "On several occasions in the past, I have written about Capt. D. Michael Abrashoff, USN (Ret.). Mike has made the transition from being a decorated and acclaimed naval officer to offering his leadership insights to business leaders. His newsletter - available on his Website at [...] - is one I look forward to reading each month.\n\nCapt. Abrashoff has authored two fascinating books that I have devoured and now look forward to sharing with you. I offer them as a one-two punch! In this posting I will review his first best seller: It's Your Ship - Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy. Later this week I will offer my thoughts on the sequel.\n\nBy his own account, Mike Abrashoff was dragged reluctantly to the enlightened conning tower where he now stands and from which vantage point he offers advice to those who desire to grow as leaders. As a young officer, Abrashoff was like many newly-minted Annapolis graduates, passing along the command and control ethos that he had absorbed and that has been the hallmark of military \"leadership\" for generations. As XO aboard the Shiloh, he learned a signal and indelible lesson in command when he unthinkingly passed down the chain of command an order that eventuated in a sailor falling asleep while standing watch - an egregious offense aboard a warship.\n\n\"Well, this was an open-and-shut case - if you are asleep on watch, you are guilty. There was no need to bother about the facts. So, I sent the sailor to the captain for punishment, without any further investigation.\n\nTo my utter surprise, the captain asked the sailor why he had fallen asleep on watch. The sailor said he had been up all night cleaning a dirty workspace. Why did he have to stay up to clean it? Because the chief told him it had to be done by 8:00 A.M.\"\n\nAs the investigation continued and the chain of orders found it's way back to Abrashoff, the department head told the captain: \"The XO told me to get it done by 8 A.M.\"\n\nAbrashoff shares the lessons he learned that memorable day:\n\n\"How in the world could I have known that they were so short-handed that they would have to keep someone up all night to get it finished? But in fact I should have known or at least been approachable enough for the officers to feel safe explaining to me why it was a problematic order. I didn't get all the facts; I didn't realize that there were not enough resources to get the job done in the time I had allowed. The captain dismissed the case and I felt like a complete idiot. Never again, I promised myself, would I give an order without clearly articulating the goal, providing the time and resources to get it done, and ensuring that my crew had the proper training to do it right.\" (Pages 34-35)\n\nThat watershed moment in Captain Abrashoff's career led him to make many adjustments in his view of leadership, his willingness to listen, his approach to the chain of command, and his commitment to champion the cause of his people so that they could be equipped for success. The pinnacle of his career as a naval officer was commanding the USS Benfold in the Persian Gulf and seeing his ship transformed from a dysfunctional amalgamation of misfits and malcontents into a proud vessel that was awarded the Spokane Trophy, emblematic of the best ship in the Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn this book, Abrashoff recounts many of the lessons he learned along the way - lessons that are all immediately applicable to any business or organization. He manages to tell the story of his own development as a leader and the development of his shipmates without coming across as arrogant. Clearly, the unapproachable Abrashoff of page 35 somehow transformed himself into a very approachable and engaging leader who not only set a high standard for his own crew, but offers transferable lessons to business leaders willing to listen and read.\n\nEach chapter treats one leadership lesson or principle and fleshes out the abstract ideas with stories of the men and women who were the crew that brought about the transformation of the Benfold.\n\nTake Command\n\nLead By Example\n\nListen Aggressively\n\nCommunicate Purpose and Meaning\n\nCreate a Climate of Trust\n\nLook for Results, not Salutes\n\nTake Calculated Risks\n\nGo Beyond Standard Procedure\n\nBuild Up Your People\n\nGenerate Unity\n\nImprove Your People's Quality of Life\n\nI had two over-arching reactions to the book. First, was a realization that all of these lessons can be boiled down into a simple dictum and recipe for success: Set high standards for yourself and your people, create an environment that challenges them\n\nto embrace those standards as their own, and then train, equip, encourage and communicate with your people in such a way that you empower their success.\n\nSecond, this approach to excellence and leadership is very reminiscent of the\n\nprinciples of leadership I have heard articulated by my friends who have flown and taught at the Navy's Top Gun school.\n\nAbrashoff's style of writing is one that I enjoy. His use of colorful and apt metaphors raises the quality of the writing above the level of most leadership books I have encountered. By way of encouraging you to read this book, I share the closing paragraph:\n\n\"In business, I have encountered many companies with the kind of bad habits and poor leadership that troubled Benfold when I first went aboard. Too many company departments appear blind to what they could accomplish together. Bereft of good leadership, they are trapped in needless bickering, politics and posturing, with predictable damage to the bottom line. And yet unity of purpose is quite achievable, even against heavy odds, and sometimes because of them. We created unity on Benfold. The U.S. military did it in Afghanistan. I am convinced that businesses everywhere can do the same. After all, it's our ship.\"\n\nEnjoy reading this book, and bon voyage!\n\nAL",
    "This book emphasized efficiency and empowerment. I believe stressing the importance of trusting in each individuals potential that is inside each of us and can be develop in any environment we are willing to transform. Great book for youth coaches. Listening and giving autonomy to our young developing minds. Do not kill someone’s creativity by presuming our answers and decisions are always the best. Thank you Captain Abrashoff, at accomplishing something new!",
    "Great leadership book about how how anyone can turn an organization around with great leadership and putting your people before yourself and not letting egos and titles derail you your organization. Loved it!",
    "\"We all feel satisfaction in a job well done, but the greatest satisfaction transcends personal achievement - it comes from helping others reach their potential.\" ~ Captain D. Michael Abrashoff\n\nWhat does leading a ship in the U.S. Navy have to do with your workplace? You might be surprised!\n\nIt's Your Ship is not a book I would necessarily have picked up for myself but, on a friend's recommendation, I gave it a try. By the time I finished reading and obsessively highlighting the Introduction, I was hooked.\n\nTaking command of the Navy ship, USS Benfold, Captain D. Michael Abrashoff quickly discovered his leadership skills needed refining if he was to succeed in his new role. It's Your Ship summarizes his lessons learned, which eventually set Benfold apart as an extraordinary model of efficiency, teamwork, and multifaceted leadership. Right from the start, Abrashoff puts into practice one of the most important leadership principles: In order to successfully lead others, you must first lead yourself - be the leader in your own life.\n\nAbrashoff shares excellent tips highlighted by the context of his Navy experience. While you may think your organization differs vastly from the military, his stories and examples help you easily apply his suggestions to leadership roles in business, nonprofit, academia, and beyond. I have shared many of his tips with my coaching clients, with three in particular that stand out:\n\n1. Listen Aggressively.\n\nAbrashoff discovered early that his crew was talented, smart, and filled with good ideas - but they hadn't always felt they were heard. \"I decided that my job was to listen aggressively,\" he writes, discussing how he conducted one-on-one interviews with each of his 300+ crew members. He learned about their families, their reasons for enlisting, what they liked and didn't like about Benfold, and more.\n\n\"Something happened in me as a result of those interviews,\" Abrashoff shares. \"I came to respect my crew enormously.\"\n\nWhen you truly listen and act upon their suggestions, your team feels validated and important - like they matter. Nearly all of us crave this sense of mattering in our work experience. As a leader, you can uplift your team profoundly by simply asking questions and listening deeply.\n\n2. Never Fail The Washington Post Test.\n\nOne of the first principles Abrashoff learned involved leading by example. As Gandhi famously said, \"You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\"\n\nWinning is important, but not at the cost of one's ethics and integrity. Abrashoff kept himself in check by regularly asking himself: \"If what I'm about to do appeared on the front page of the Washington Post tomorrow, would I be proud or embarrassed?\"\n\nThis simple question can do wonders as an accountability check, especially important since, as he later reminds us, \"A leader's every action is always scrutinized.\" You could replace Washington Post with your most respected publication or person; in my family we often substitute \"your grandparents.\"\n\n3. Communicate Meaning And Purpose.\n\nThis lesson is twofold: First, your team must purposefully connect with the mission of your organization. When Abrashoff noticed low passion and enthusiasm among his crew, he realized what was missing: \"No one had ever thought to give them a compelling vision of their work, a good reason to believe it was important.\" Burnout, loss of engagement, even turnover often result from a sense of disconnect between an employee's work and its importance to the organization, consumer, and world at large. As a leader, you need to help your employees connect these dots.\n\nSecond, you must communicate well, effectively, and often. \"No matter how fantastic your message is,\" Abrashoff learned, \"if no one is receiving it, you aren't communicating.\" Define the vision, mission, and values of your organization, then communicate them clearly and often.\n\nI recently reviewed The Servant by James C. Hunter, in which the author outlines the qualities of servant leadership: Respect, dignity, and a focus on developing other leaders rather than building your own prestige, to name a few. Abrashoff's suggestions thoroughly align with this powerful leadership concept, while providing the unique perspective of its application in the military.\n\nThroughout It's Your Ship, Abrashoff exhibits his \"winning leader's first principle: Optimism rules.\" He clearly understands that the leader sets the tone and focused his energy on creating an atmosphere of positivity, excellence, and trust, recognizing the win-win outcome. \"Anything you can do to understand your people, support them in tough times, and nurture their gifts,\" he writes, \"will pay benefits to your bottom line.\"\n\nWhether your \"ship\" is an actual Navy ship, a company, a department or a family, It's Your Ship offers insightful, practical strategies that will elevate your leadership and strengthen your team with meaning and purpose.",
    "Great account of a good leaders journey over several years in the US navy with principles transferable to civilian life too.",
    "Very relevant to the business world. A fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable story, one of rising above out moded practices, finding a new and better way, one of showing respect for every person regardless. A story that inspires you to make a difference yourself, to take risks, to do the right thing, to be part of something greater.\nI would recommend this for anyone who is a leader or a manager.",
    "It’s Your Ship is a guided tour of organisational and personal leadership. Immensely helpful for both new and established leaders.",
    "This is an incredible book in which the author tells his incredible story I strongly recommend this book to those, like myself, who have aspirations of leadership in the services as well as young and old entrepreneurs. I can’t stress how good this book is and how much I have learned and hope to use in my future career and life.\n\nTo the author,\nThank you for this incredible advice I hope one day I could emulate your actions and improve the lives of people around be.",
    "I am a new leader developing my skills and this has given me good ideas on how to enhance not only myself but the team's that I lead",
    "This book is a great read. I finished it in one sitting and it should help everyone who aspires to be a leader or is an existing leader to become an outstanding leader. Packed with real examples of how to transform an organisation and to lead effectively while creating a culture of fun and unrivalled excellence."

    "I’m reading this book because I'm a fan of Dr. Hardy’s previous work and knew it would support my current endeavors. But I didn't expect that it would instantly change my relationship with my father.\n\nHe's a great man. Think: ”Most interesting man in the world…” from the Dos Equis beer commercial. He's got gravitas... Green Beret - special forces, 6th-degree Tae Kwon Do Karate Master and accomplished surrealist painter - art instructor.\n\nLately, I've been struggling in our relationship because he’s pissed at how age is limiting him at this point in life. I’ve been trying to help and when his anger is directed at me, it feels like a betrayal since I've spent most of my whole life adapting and catering to his PTSD. It makes me feel sad and no matter how I try to help, it just causes friction. So I’ve been staying away not knowing what else to do.\n\nLast night I read the chapter about Hope and the future self. It dawned on me that he’s done everything and seen so much in life. He isn’t working toward any goals. He’s retired and basically bored out of his mind which inflames his PTSD. (Not a good combo believe me).\n\nWell, I’ve always wanted to learn to paint. I think NOW is the time… I called and asked him to give me a solid foundation for painting.\n\nI'M IN TEARS to tell you what it means to hear my father, this great man - who spent his entire life 'becoming' his future self and achieving great heights - thank ME for giving him the opportunity to teach me what he knows. We set a bunch of dates.\n\nWe're friends again. He's got a goal. I'm excited to learn. It’s going to be so awesome.\n\nThank You Dr. Hardy!!! (and thanks to anyone still reading)",
    "I have a small library of books that I consider treasures. I read them repeatedly because I always get something new.\n\nOr rather, I have changed, and I see something new.\n\nBe Your Future Self Now will be added to this library. It changed how I see myself. I now clearly understand why I get stuck and what to do about it.\n\nIt’s a step-by-step manual on how to design the life you crave.\n\nI got crystal clear on three goals I want to achieve over the next three years. And I have a plan on how I will make it happen. Now that I’m clear about what I want to achieve, I will make decisions today as if I’m already that person– three years from now.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. It requires work. Lots of it. The ideas and concepts are science-based research–not fantasy or “The Secret.”\n\nFor example, I want to hit a net worth objective over the next three years. Based on my current ability, this number is not achievable. What would my future self do today to put me on that path? Since reading the book, I have hired a new team of experts, immersing myself in financial education.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick fix or are allergic to work–this is not the book for you.\n\nIf you are stuck and want to move past this state and live the life you crave – add this book to your permanent library.",
    "I’ve followed Dr Hardy for 2 years and am now in his AMP Platinum coaching program. I can’t say enough about what I’m getting from this experience.\n\nI’m expanding my life by focusing my attention.\n\nIt’s so true: I am not at all who I was 10 years ago, and in 10 years I will be unrecognizable again.\n\nNext up: Who Not How",
    "This is 4th book I read from Dr. Benjamin Hardy. I first read \"Personality isn't permanent\" and thought ok I am shocked, there is hope for me haha, then I read \"The Gap and the Gain\" and woke me up at a very challenging time. Now I start reading \"Be your future self now\" and while each book is focused on the idea of starting from thinking of your future self and act forward, each book has its different flavor to it, associated with the great science behind and incredible storytelling skills of the Author making these books practical to the point you want to act now. Before I even read half way of the book I started making changing into my life. I now have a better awareness of what I say yes to and it forced me to stop postponing clarifying my vision of my future self to begin with. Look forward to finish the book as I read it slow so that I hope Dr. Benjamin comes up with the next one and the next one before I run out of his great work :)",
    "I appreciate how clearly Benjamin Hardy's process of \"becoming\" is outlined. Among many great insights, his acknowledgement of our religious/non-religious beliefs affecting this process is spot-on. Lots of golden nuggets to ponder on and apply. Absolutely worth the investment of time and money to read this book.",
    "No matter the title, this book is essentially about goal setting and planning your future rather than envisioning your future. That said, it’s a great book with a different approach.\n\nI like the way the author frequently uses his own experience and is not afraid of showing his own vulnerability. The unique perspective of this book is that the author often pointed to our own experience to let us think about how to apply our lessons learnt to our future planning.\n\nIt is also a motivational book that could easily inspire one to lead a more meaningful life.",
    "Wow! Bought the ebook version within the last 12 hours, reading chapter one and It has already created such a deep and mindset-shifting perspective for me.\nIt truly helps you be present, intentional, and focused on what really matters to you and in your life right now!\n4 starts because I’ve just started reading the book, though I know that I would really like the book from beginning to end based on how the author presented the main idea about this book- the title of the book itself.\n\nWill update after reading the whole book.\nGreat and such an awesome piece of work Mr Hardy. Thank you!",

I managed to quit my job, build my own business as a writers' coach, and I now stay on track with my routines, decluttering my schedule, and keeping my future self goals in mind when I plan my week.\n\nThere are so many nuggets in there, and here's how they have worked for me:\n\n- envision your future self to gain clarity about what you really want in life (not just what society wants from you)\n\n- emotionally connect with your future self to stop self-sabotage (this helped me a lot with panic attacks, I envisioned my future self reaching out a hand and helping me out of flight or fight)\n\n- filter all your goals, meetings, people, and activities through your future self vision and eliminate what no longer serves you (I have been able to quit obligations, meetings, and annoying activities that held me back and were once important for my past self, but not my new self; it was super hard to uncommit but I was doing to clear the plate for my future self to live a better life)\n\n- build systems in your life (I'm a writer and coach - this was important!) to stay on track and, in my case, keep writing my book and creating systems for my clients\n\n- find the right people to support your transformation (I have two coaches helping me with my mental health issues and building my career - I would never have invested money into coaching if I hadn't known the Future Self method, and I'm already getting returns on investment in terms of peace of mind and income)\n\n- enjoy the ride and see yourself transforming every day in small steps (this is hard for me - I know how to work like a horse, but not how to have peak moments and enjoy the small wins; the book helped me see the beauty in small successes)\n\nYou certainly have to not just read the book, but follow the advice. But if you do even just a few things you'll see the change happen.\n\nMy best tip: Try to find Dr Hardy's \"Future Self\" online course that accompanies his book - it contains a lot of simple but profound tips on how to turn the knowledge from the book into action. I'm watching the videos at the moment and they are a perfect companion to the book.\n\nAs a book writer and coach, this is a great productivity book that doesn't want to make you work harder, but better. I am recommending it to everyone I know.",
    "I have this book in Kindle, hardback, and audiobook. I've also bought the Kindle version for a few people as the concepts within are important.\nThe premise is that our ideal future self already exists, and we can 'borrow' from it right now in order to help create it.\nI've discussed the ideas with my teenage daughter as she is anxiety-ridden. We've discussed her ideal future self, and that the best way to become her ideal self is to borrow from it to use now. She has since joined a drama club and an animal rescue centre.\n'Where there is no vision, the people perish'. Creating a vision of your ideal future self gives one (who may feel hopeless) something to aim for, and the concept may well be semantics but it does seem to work.\nMy main gripe is that there is a chapter where the good Doctor goes on and on about God. I was brought up in a deeply religious family, school, and social setting. Even I found this chapter in the book was a bit much.\nFour and a half stars out of Five.\nWell worth owning, reading, implementing, sharing.",
    "This book is a really useful thinking tool and excellent practical guide to make the changes you want in your life.\n\nThe premise of the book is that it is not the past, but the future, that drives a person's actions and behaviours. Humans are not driven by the past but we're pulled forward by the future we're MOST COMMITTED TO.\n\nThis is very empowering as we tend to define our present and future purely based on our past and this is really limiting. This book provides a clear framework of how you break free from that thinking and embrace your future self and commit to what you want to build and become without the baggage of the past.\n\nThe book is laid out well, it is a short and easy read and I really like the illustrations which bring to life the concepts and strategies. There are useful concepts from other authors e.g. Stephen Covey, Viktor Frankl, Joe Dispenza, Anders Ericsson, Angela Duckworth, Seth Godin, Marshal Goldsmith, Ray Dalio, James Clear, Carol Dweck, BJ Fogg, Tim Ferriss, Steven Pressfield and others and it brings to life how these can be used to create your Future self now.\n\nIt is an enjoyable book and Ben uses stories well to help demonstrate examples of how people have used this thinking. I also love his personal anecdotes and sharing of his future self commitments and how he is using these tools.\n\nAdditionally, Ben has created some great set of tools that come free with the book with links inside. These include:\n\n- A video Deep Dive into the concepts of the books and providing full clarity on how your become your Future Self\n- Commit and Connect tools where you can email yourself letters from your future self\n- A future self imagination tool\n- A checklist to determine which threats are impacting you most right now\n- A checklist to determine which steps will help you become your future self now\n\nThese tools makes the book very practical and easy to take action on.\n\nThis book will help you change your mindset, beliefs and mental models to radically change your life. I highly recommend this practical guide and have gifted this to family, colleagues and friends.",
    "I have been following Dr Benjamins Hardy's work for some time now.\nI bought his previous book and watch his excellent youtube videos\nIn my opinion he is the go to authority on prospection -\n\nI particularly like how he uses a huge range of sources - he has exposed me to some amazing books and ideas\nMy favourite part of the book was how he suggested some practical\nways of communicating much more intentionally with your future self.\n\nThis is an important book but really accessible and easy to read.",
    "I loved the practical exercises, which changed who I am throughout the course of the book, and I really appreciate what it has done for me."

    "Not all good intentions do the good they intend, or , even if they do, an equal contribution may have done hundreds of times more good , even in the same area, so William MacAskill is a champion for \"Effective Altruism\".\n5 of his key questions to consider before donating your time or money or other resources are:\n\n1. How many people benefit, and by how much?\nThe quality-adjusted life year, or QALY, allows us to compare the impact of different sorts of health programs. Suppose you want to donate $10,000 and need to choose between two options: a 40-year-old with AIDS or a 20-year-old who is going blind. The first option will improve the recipient’s quality of life by 50% to 90% for five years. This equals 6.5 QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years). The second option improves the recipient’s quality of life from 40% to 100%. This equals 30 QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years).\n2. Is this the most effective thing you can do?\nAfter going through Scared Straight, juveniles were more likely to commit crimes than they would have been otherwise, so the program did harm overall.\n3. Is this area neglected?\nNatural disasters get far more funding than ongoing causes of death and suffering such as disease; for that reason, disaster relief usually isn’t the most effective use of funds. Diseases, like malaria, that affect people in the developing world get far less funding than conditions like cancer; for that reason you have a much bigger impact treating people with malaria than with cancer.\n4. What would have happened otherwise? In careers like medicine, you’re sometimes simply doing good work that would have happened anyway; if you earn to give, however, you make a difference that wouldn’t otherwise have occurred.\n5. What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? Some activities—such as voting, entering politics, campaigning for systemic change, or mitigating risks of global catastrophe—are effective not because they’re likely to make a difference but because their impact is so great if they do make a difference.",
    "QUICK SUMMARY:\nThis book is a guide on making the most difference with your altruism. It does this by providing frameworks of questions for how to find the most effective ways to reduce suffering and increase well-being with your time and money. You should care because optimizing your altruism can ensure you do not waste your time and money, and can let you make thousands of times more of a difference in people’s lives.\n\nINTRO\n\n[DISCLAIMER: I am a part of the Effective Altruism Movement.]\n\nThis review discusses the following questions in order:\n\nWhat is this book about, and who is it for?\nWhy should you care?\nHow does this book help you make a difference?\nIs this book worth the time/money? Would other resources be better?\n\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT, AND WHO IS IT FOR?\nFirst off, this book is not about morality. It will not help you to be a more selfless person, nor a similarly “better” person. It is a how-to guide for making as much of a difference as possible with the time and money you are already willing to give.\n\nIt focuses on those who want to: 1) save as many lives as possible, and/or 2) reduce as much suffering and increase the well-being of as many people as possible. It focuses on helping humans, but the same reasoning it presents can be used for helping non-human animals and the environment, both of which it discusses in chapter 8. It discusses the following and more to differing degrees:\n\nGlobal poverty. Criminal justice reform. Immigration. Ethical consumerism. Animal rights. Climate change. Nuclear threats. Science research. Career choice (for example, non-profit -vs- profit?). Sweatshops.\n\nSo, if you are interested in making as much of a difference as possible in the above, you might benefit from this book.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU CARE?\n1. Optimizing your altruism can help you make a huge difference in people’s lives.\n2. Your current altruism probably doesn’t make nearly as much of a difference as it could.\n\n1. Optimizing your altruism can help you make a huge difference in people’s lives. I’ll let the book speak on this:\n\n“According to the most rigorous estimates, the cost to save a life in the developing world is about $3,400...This is a small enough amount that most of us in affluent countries could donate that amount every year while maintaining about the same quality of life...we could save a life every working year of our lives. Donating to [the most effective charities] is not nearly as glamorous as [saving someone from a burning building], but the benefits are just as great. Through the simple act of donating to the most effective charities, we have the power to save dozens of lives. That’s pretty amazing.” - \"Doing Good Better\", chapter 3\n\n2. Your current altruism probably doesn’t make nearly as much of a difference as it could:\n\nThis is because there is a huge difference between \"merely good\" charities and the best charities. Humans have many biases that lead us to irrational conclusions in altruism. Unfortunately, many well-intentions have done more harm than good. This book discusses these topics in-depth.\n\n\"Doing Good Better\"’s Intro and chapter 1 answer very well the question of why you should care.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BOOK HELP YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\nIt provides frameworks of questions to optimize your altruism based on evidence. In fact, when it presents specific ways for doing good better, it is mainly to present examples of how to use these frameworks. The main framework is explained and defended in the first part of this book, called “The Five Key Questions of Effective Altruism” (see the chapter names for the questions). It also provides frameworks for considering the following questions:\n\nWhich charity should you donate to? (chapter 7)\nWhich career should you pursue? (chapter 9)\nWhich cause should you focus on? (chapter 10)\n\nThe oddball out is chapter 8, which analyzes the following using the \"Five Key Questions”:\n\nSweatshops.\nFairtrade.\nGoing green.\nVegetarianism.\n\nIS THIS BOOK WORTH THE TIME/MONEY? WOULD OTHER RESOURCES BE BETTER?\nA bit about myself so you know on what I base my opinions: I have read the following books relevant to making the most difference with your altruism:\n\nPeter Singer’s \"The Most Good You Can Do\"\nPeter Singer’s \"The Life You Can Save\"\nJeffrey Sach’s \"The End of Poverty\"\nPaul Collier’s \"The Bottom Billion\"\nNicholas Kristof’s and Sheryl WuDunn’s \"Half the Sky\"\n\nFurthermore, I have engaged in many other resources by the Effective Altruism community as well as by aid critics such as William Easterly.\n\nIn my opinion, if your ideas of making the most difference mostly aligns with the author’s, then \"Doing Good Better\" is the clearest guide for making the most difference. I personally will be using its frameworks to help me think through things. I expect its clarity to make my decisions much more effective and efficient, making the book well worth the time and money even though I was already familiar with Effective Altruism resources. If you want a how-to guide on Effective Altruism, then I highly recommend this book. If not, then other resources may be better.\n\nWhile \"Doing Good Better\" has many number-based arguments for Effective Altruism, if you are interested in more philosophical arguments, then I would recommend the two books by Peter Singer above. If you are interested in understafnding the Effective Altruism Movement, I would recommend \"The Most Good You Can Do\". If you are interested in learning about the causes and effects of global poverty, then I would recommend \"The Bottom Billion\". If you are interested in trying to understand extreme poverty at a human level--for example, to be motivated by it--then I would recommend \"Half the Sky\".\n\nPlease feel free to email me questions or responses at ZacharySmith4989 at that Google email. Have a good one! ( :",
    "Given the amount of money donated to charities which never reaches the intended recipients, this book is long overdue. MacAskill provides an analytic framework with which to assess the 'most effective' ways in which our money can work for us after donation.\n\nHis research base appears sound, while some of his discoveries are hair-raising about the way in which large amounts of money are wasted in apparently 'good' causes, for example 'Fairtrade', where almost all of the money is swallowed up by 'middlemen', while yet other 'obviously' better approaches to pumping water is also a huge waste of money, with the 'heart ruling the head'.\n\nThe framework MacAskill provides can be used to assess & identify charities & causes which are likely to have the most effective, efficient impact on people's lives, in many cases where relatively small amounts of money can have an impact far beyond what might be imagined.\n\nIf this still seems like too much hard work, MacAskill helps identify some current projects where donors can be assured their money will be effectively & efficiently used, and also the details of the regulatory body for charities which monitors the on-going effectiveness of these charities/projects, to ensure money donated can be wisely targeted in the future. There's also an interesting chapter on how to make a difference by your choice of career, and an exploration of ecosystem issues (& global warming), and the nature of poverty & 'sweatshops', revealing the latter to have a much more beneficial face than might be expected.\n\nFascinating & thought-provoking reading.",
    "I make regular donations to several charities, but this book has really made me stop and think about whether I've chosen my charities well, and I don't believe I have.\nThe author expresses a radical way of thinking about how to do the most good with both money and time. It has really opened my eyes and transformed my thought processes in deciding which organisations to support.\nIf you'd like your charity donations to make the biggest positive impact on the greatest number of people possible then this is a must read.",
    "An excellent and thought-provoking read, well set out and very readable. It has also made me re-think certain things like ethical brands and 'sweat shops'. It certainly gives a lot of food for thought. I've now lent this book to a friend and look forward to reading it again to put some of what I've learned into action. Like all science, the best gems lie in the counter-intuitive and MacAskill discusses them really well. A high recommend.",
    "Good, aside from the main example (about the effect de-worming children in Africa has on education) which the book is based around has since been reanalysed, with doubts cast about how effective it is. I don't really think this changes the central message of the book, however, it just means that if given the choice you would no longer donate money to the charity discussed in the book.",
    "Made me really think hard about the best way to be effective in an altruistic life"

    "This is without question one of the finest popular introductions to any subject written in the past several decades. Heilbroner does not intend this as a full-fledged introduction to economics and certainly could never serve as an introduction to the subject in a classroom setting, but it is an exceedingly well-written, highly informed, enormously entertaining first-dip into what Carlyle called \"the dismal science.\" Although Heilbroner does not neglect either historical context or the ideas driving the worldly philosophers, the account is distinguished by great attention to the lives of the leading economists. He is throughout as concerned to have us get to know the men behind the ideas as the ideas themselves.\n\nI suspect that part of Heilbroner's motivation in focusing so much on the lives of the great economists is that so many of them were such interesting individuals that their very existences dispel some of the stereotype of economics being dull and dry. Mind you, not even Heilbroner's lively pen can enliven some of these individuals' lives. Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Alfred Marshall lived remarkably uneventful lives. But Heilbroner is at his best depicting the marvelously odd friendship of Malthus and Ricardo, the quirks of Saint-Simon and Henry George, the wonderful eccentricity of Thorstein Veblen, and the easy genius of John Maynard Keynes. Not that Heilbroner neglects the ideas. He writes wonderfully about many of the key ideas driving the thought of each of these thinkers, but he neither tries to be exhaustive (he barely touches on the highpoints of Marx, for instance) nor attempt to detach them from the context of particular individuals living at a particular juncture in history.\n\nI have to say something about Heilbroner's style. Today, unfortunately, too many scholars simply cannot write. This has always been true to an extent, but fewer and fewer academics seem to foster the ability to write mellifluous sentences. Heilbroner does not belong to their ranks. He resembles fellow scholars such as Lewis Thomas and Simon Schama in his ability to write memorably, cleverly, and clearly. The degree to which this enhances the value of the book as a whole cannot be overemphasized.\n\nFinally, because today virtually all talk of economics passes easily into political economy, I should say something about Heilbroner's own point of view. I say \"point of view\" rather than \"bias\" simply because the latter is one of--if not THE--most abused terms in the United States today (it is not abused in other countries). Talk of \"bias\" rather than truth or falsity arose in the early 1970s when many conservatives realized that they had lost the debates of the sixties. Unable to win arguments on a level playing field, conservatives wanting to infiltrate the mass media concocted the plan of redefining discussion of contemporary issues in terms of bias rather than truth. Instead of an idea being discussed in terms of its ultimate rightness or wrongness, goodness or badness, the Right (largely in response to the famous Powell memo--just Google \"Powell\" and \"memo\"--for a world of resources on this--Lewis Powell, by the way, late in life while still on the Supreme Court came to feel that his position in the memo was mistaken) wanted to change the terms of the debate to the particular points of view of the individuals involved (he said, she said). Part of this involved the invention of the myth of the liberal media. The media, they argued, was biased, it was liberal (though it certainly was not liberal). My point is this: having a point of view does not equate to bias, and even having a bias does not mean that one warps the facts to fit one's position. I do not think that Heilbroner is \"biased.\" But his positions do place him at a particular point on the political spectrum. He is very far to the left. Though not perfect, he thinks the reforms of the New Deal were a very good thing indeed. But he is far more to the left than that: he thinks socialism has much to recommend, but he is a realist in that he believes we are, for good or ill, stuck with a capitalist system. At least for now. Thus we do not find a near worship of the ideas of Adam Smith (though in fact most on the Right who bring up Smith actually are talking about the Vienna School's imaginative recreation of him and not the historical Adam Smith) nor a knee jerk dismissal of Keynes or even Marx. I would, in fact, say that throughout Heilbroner, though a leftist, treats all the major figures rather fairly. Had he in later editions of his book extended his book beyond Schumpeter, who ends the book, to include von Mises, Hayek, Polanyi, Samuelson, Arrow, Friedman, Sen, and others, he might have found some he would have found more (Polanyi, Samuelson, Arrow, and Sen) congenial and others he would have found less (von Mises, Hayek, and Friedman). What I want to emphasize he how balanced Heilbroner is.\n\nI heartily recommend this to anyone wanting an introduction to the history of economic thinking. It is hard to find a more successful popular introduction to an intellectual discipline than this. Although first published in the early 1950s, Heilbroner revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, the final time in the late nineties. For a highly readable introduction to the first two hundred years of economic thinking, it can hardly be surpassed.",
    "I often buy books on AMZN (a great American company) and just browse a chapter or two, or read the conclusion and this book was worth the $9, so I won't throw it away. I'll paraphrase:\n\n\"I started off on this project in the 50s and had to read up on Adam Smith, Marx, Keynes, Mill, Schumpeter etc. (edit: all of whose wiki page I have read, of course) It was fascinating and the book has been a success beyond my dreams. But when I open Mankiw book, it's all math. Not economics. And when I open Stiglitz book, it is 997 pages and doesn't contain the word \"capitalism\" in it. That doesn't sound quite right\"\n\nHe concludes: \"...but leadership will lack for clear directions without the inspiration of an enlightened as well as an enlarged self-definition of economics. Assuredly such a new economics will incorporate knowledge from the domains of other branches of social inquiry...\" etc\n\nBut economics is simple: ...and there should be no such thing as \"an economist\". They are worse than lawyers.... Just let the economy alone - don't mess with it, or you disrupt it and hurt it. This has been known for hundreds of years!! --what have we just done? C'est la vie\n\nHad to deduct a star because he was a Marxist pleb for most of his life but then added that star it back because he conceded to Hayek, Friedman and Mises per wiki that socialism been an abysmal failure. Unfortunately it's coming back with a vengeance. \"We are all communists now\"",
    "From time we find books like this. A book full of insight, information and lessons about the world. Yes, from time to time you read a book that is more than its subject because the scope is so wide and open. In cases like this, everything seems to make sense and get connected, from an equation in mathematical terms to a rainy day in London. Yes, I loved the reading because it teaches something new about something that seems quiet obvious or trivial. Everyone has a theory and a solution to the inequality or the famine in the world, but more often than not, they are all wrong. As M. Gladwell once said, people lacks theories and --usually-- they act ignoring this tiny detail. Theories, explanations, this is what our curious philosophers gives us to see the world the other way round, i.e., as it really is.\n\nNow the book: With an exquisite, elegant and appealing style, Robert Heilbroner goes along three centuries or so in which economics has lived with us in the modern sense of the word. To make the difference he explains the emergence of the politics, markets and the capital as connected phenomenons. Never before the world had seen something like this. That's why Adam Smith wrote \"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\" on 1776 and not before. I would say that this is the first important lesson that Mr. Heilbroner gave me, a very layperson in this topic.\n\nThe book is organized in ten chapters that covers from mid eighteenth century to mid twentieth century. Every chapter transmit the context and the predominating ideas of some worldly philosopher about the changes and disruptions that economics has undergone. The underlying idea of the book is to tell the tale through the heroes of the story rather than the processes. In this sense every reader could disagree with the selection that the author made to tell the story. Why not this or that economist, but in this sense I would remain the sentence that J. L. Borges used to settle the point: there is no anthology that doesn't begin well and doesn't end bad. And this selection --like any other-- is not an exception.\n\nEvery economist is presented with his history together with his legend. All of them were really strange and freaky guys. All of them were smart and clever enough to grasp the contents of a world --our world-- which is very introspective and it doesn't speak so much about itself. So they explain the world and then they say what would happen to it in the next future if it follows the same path.\n\nI would say that every philosopher had an explanation to show how the machinery of economics worked. And I would add that all of them --even Adam Smith-- had a prophecy about the future of that machinery. This is what the book does. It gives you the character, then the ideas and, finally, the prophecies of this heroes. In a sense, all of them were right and all were wrong. The thing is that philosophy is neither a science nor a discipline that gives you a recipe for not committing mistakes. Philosophy is a discipline that gives you the tools for explaining the world showing --at the same time-- the underlying foundations that makes you feel sure about what you say. That's why our worldly philosophers could attack and criticize each other with very dangerous and lethal (i.e., intellectual) weapons.\n\nWhat do we find at last? We find an unforgettable last chapter that speaks about the future, as did the philosophers, of economics. The title of the chapter is \"The end of the worldly philosophy?\" so you you have to notice the subtle pun between philosophers and philosophy that hides with a hussy smile the last and important message of Heilbroner. I'm not going to talk about that because it would be like revealing the name of the murderer in a detective story so this will be your task as a reader if you make the decision of reading the book.\n\nThis book!\n\nOne with highly deserved five stars.",
    "This is an older edition, but stil very good.",
    "Sehr interessant zu lesen. Die Druckauflage an sich ist nicht sehr hochwertig. Allerdings super für Wirtschaftsinteressierte, vor allem da die deutsche Ausgabe eingestellt wurde und nicht mehr auffindbar ist.\nLiest sich allerdings zäh für Ungeübte. Wenn ihr jmd. fordern wollt, dann drauf zu.",
    "Fantastic book. I am an econ major and this has given me plenty of insight and context for some of the things I am learning, as mentioned by many others - this book serves a need that economics teaching often lacks. The book is divided up so each chapter covers a different economist and time in history, which makes it easy to read at your own pace. It is written to be understood by a wide audience and the author does a great job explaining economic concepts in terms everyone could understand.",
    "Best book ever written on economics. Economics is a dry science, but the author managed not only to generate interest but integrate over a period of 400 years. Right from Adam Smith to Joseph Schumpster. Great read.",
    "This book was recommended to me by a fellow economist - myself being an economist with very little knowledge of economic philosophy. I learned a lot from this book. Heilbroner is a fantastic writer and he makes the subject interesting and easy to approach. I would recommend this book to both economists and non-economists both who are looking for some background knowledge in political economy."

    "Creativity Inc: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in The Way of True Inspiration is the intertwined stories of Ed Catmull and Pixar Animation. It’s more than that, though. It may be the best book you’ll ever read about how leaders and organizations can make it possible for people to use their whole creative brain power. I know that’s a bold statement. Here’s why I make it.\n\nThere is a vast literature out there about how individual people can tap into their natural, God-given creativity. There’s no one best book in this crop, but if you find one that works for you, that one’s the best as far as you’re concerned.\n\nThere’s not a lot about how organizations and leaders can unleash creativity and most of it is platitudes on parade. We’re told to “fail fast and fail often” as if failing was the point. It’s not. Learning is the point. We’re told to tell people they should not be afraid to fail. What nonsense. Nobody likes to fail, and if they’re afraid to fail, it’s not their fault. It’s yours. We’re also given that advice as if there is an alternative to doing creative cutting-edge work without getting it wrong, mostly at the beginning. There isn’t. That’s the way the world works.\n\nSome writers do a better job on this by talking about ways you can structure things so that a failure is more likely to be seen as a learning experience and where criticism and bad news can be received as gifts rather than attacks. But there’s precious little in those books about how you actually make it work and then keep it working over time.\n\nCreativity Inc is different. The primary reason is Ed Catmull and his willingness to talk about the details of both his and Pixar’s journeys. Here’s what I consider the key quote from very early in the book.\n\n“What makes Pixar special is that we acknowledge we will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; but we work hard to uncover those problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it.”\n\nEarly in the book, Catmull tells the story of a table in a meeting room at Pixar. The table, evidently, looks like most of the tables in most meeting rooms that I’ve been in. It was rectangular. Most of us have heard that tables with that shape aren’t exactly symbols of an egalitarian culture and that they stifle open discussion. But we keep meeting around those tables. So did Pixar.\n\n“Over the course of a decade, we held countless meetings around this table in this way – completely unaware of how doing so undermined our own core principles.”\n\nWhen Catmull and his crew become aware of the effect of the table, they change it. Good for them. Then they discover that there are other behaviors that may have been linked to the table originally but continue after the table is changed. For example, on the old table there were place cards indicating where people sat. Powerful people at the ends, junior people toward the middle. The new square table removed the power of shape but the place cards had become common practice, too. So, when Catmull came into the room for a meeting around the new table, he found place cards indicating where everyone should sit.\n\nThat is the book in a nutshell. Catmull covers a lot of ground and many topics, but the core book is about how he, John Lasseter, and other people at Pixar, uncovered problems and worked to solve them, nurtured creative energy, and dealt with the inevitable conflicts and surprises. Every organization that I’ve ever worked with or visited has had similar issues.\n\nOne problem putting together the review for this book is that it is simply riddled with wisdom. So, rather than give you the standard chapter summaries that I put in most reviews, I’m going to list each of the four sections and name the chapters that are in it, then share some quotes from that section. I’m sure that when you read the book, you will find your own insightful bits that are different from mine.\n\nPart 1 is called Getting Started. The four chapters, Animated, Pixar Is Born, A Defining Goal, and Establishing Pixar’s Identity, tell the story of Ed Catmull and Pixar up until the success of “Toy Story.”\n\n\"I also didn’t yet know that my self-assigned mission was about much more than technology. To pull it off, we’d have to be creative not only technically but also in the ways that we worked together.\"\n\n\"What had drawn me to science, all those years ago, was the search for understanding. Human interaction is far more complex than relativity or string theory, of course, but that only made it more interesting and important; it constantly challenged my presumptions. As we made more movies, I would learn that some of my beliefs about why and how Pixar had been successful were wrong. But one thing could not have been more plain: Figuring out how to build a sustainable creative culture—one that didn’t just pay lip service to the importance of things like honesty, excellence, communication, originality, and self-assessment but really committed to them, no matter how uncomfortable that became—wasn’t a singular assignment. It was a day-in-day-out, full-time job. And one that I wanted to do.\"\n\nPart 2 is titled Protecting the New. That’s a theme that will run through the book from here on. The chapters are: Honesty and Candor, Fear and Failure, The Hungry Beast and The Ugly Baby, Change and Randomness, and The Hidden.\n\n“Because early on, all of our movies suck. That’s a blunt assessment, I know, but I make a point of repeating it often, and I choose that phrasing because saying it in a softer way fails to convey how bad the first versions of our films really are. I’m not trying to be modest or self-effacing by saying this. Pixar films are not good at first, and our job is to make them so—to go, as I say, ‘from suck to not-suck.’ This idea—that all the movies we now think of as brilliant were, at one time, terrible—is a hard concept for many to grasp”\n\n“So if your primary goal is to have a fully worked out, set-in-stone plan, you are only upping your chances of being unoriginal.”\n\n\"One of the biggest barriers is fear, and while failure comes with the territory, fear shouldn’t have to. The goal, then, is to uncouple fear and failure—to create an environment in which making mistakes doesn’t strike terror into your employees’ hearts.\"\n\n\"If you don’t try to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.\"\n\nPart 3 is titled Building and Sustaining. There are only two chapters: Broadening Our View and The Unmade Future.\n\n\"This third section of the book is devoted to some of the specific methods we have employed at Pixar to prevent our disparate views from hindering our collaboration. In each case, we are trying to force ourselves—individually and as a company—to challenge our preconceptions.\"\n\n\"Companies, like individuals, do not become exceptional by believing they are exceptional but by understanding the ways in which they aren’t exceptional. Postmortems are one route into that understanding.”\n\nPart 4, titled Testing What We Know, also has just two chapters. They are A New Challenge and Notes Day.\n\n\"The future is not a destination—it is a direction.\"\n\nOne more thing. Steve Jobs played a critical role in Pixar’s success and Ed Catmull has included an afterword called The Steve Jobs We Knew. My friend, Bob Sutton, has said that Steve Jobs is something of a Rorschach test for people. You see what you think you see, and other people see the same thing and interpret it differently. My problem has always been that most of the views of Jobs freeze him in time and they don’t indicate any growth or maturity. No one as intelligent or introspective as Steve Jobs would have stayed the same for his entire life. What I loved about the afterword is that it not only gave a unique view of Jobs as both a business partner and a friend, but also talked about his growth during his life.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCreativity Inc: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in The Way of True Inspiration is a great book about creativity and about how to lead an organization. More importantly it is the very best book I’ve ever read about unleashing the initiative and creativity of people in an organization.",
    "Ed Catmull is the president of Pixar and Disney Animation and one of the founding members of Pixar. In “Creativity, Inc.” Catmull recounts his personal story and the creation of Pixar Animation, the many challenges that he has faced throughout his career, how he dealt with those challenges and the many lessons learned, and how to face the challenges ahead. He offers his own unique insights on creating, building, and maintaining a sustainable corporate culture and a true corporate identity that believes in, fosters, and supports creativity. With a conversational tone and common-sense, straightforward presentation, the author presents a great framework for anyone interested understanding and improving corporate culture, from the business student to the CEO. The way that Catmull presents his claims is thoughtful and genuine. He provides real-world cases and experiences to back up his assertions, never coming off as a clueless executive who’s just regurgitating the same familiar (and tired) business book tropes.\n\nIn chapters 1 through 4 Catmull tells his own journey, from a young child through the often turbulent creation of Pixar. After the creation of Pixar and the the success of Toy Story, he learned two central principles – “the story is king” and “trust the process.” The former idea was that focusing on and creating a good story would be paramount to the success of the project. The latter principle was reassurance that even if things got tough they could lean on the process that had been put in place and trust that following the it could get them over almost any hurdles.\n\nThe production of Toy Story 2, which was much more challenging, taught him that putting the right team in place is absolutely critical. The author refutes the opt-repeated idea that when building a team you should look for good ideas, not good people. As he points out, ideas come from people, so finding good people is key. Additionally, he states that it’s “…the focus on people – their work habits, their talents, their values – that is absolutely central to any creative venture.” He has since made it a priority to make sure that hired the right people and put them on projects that complement their skills, which will in turn lead to good ideas.\n\nChapters 5 through 9 are devoted to topics that challenge an organization:\n\n- Candor. There subtle difference between honesty and candor. Honesty, he says, carries a moral connotation while candor does not. He believes that candor and the ability to feel open to share one’s thoughts and ideas and criticisms is essential to maintaining a creative working environment. It allows for the evaluation and re-evaluation of the project and the opportunity to make iterative improvements throughout the project life.\n\n- Failure. While Pixar has been very fortunate to have had great successes they have also experienced their share of failures. Failure can be opportunity for growth and essential to learning. Iterative processes using trial and error, which frequently lead to failure, can help guide us to the best solution. Certainly, we should not seek out or become accepting of failure but it also should not be vilified to the point of creating a culture that avoids risk due to fear, stifling creativity and innovation.\n\n- “Feeding the beast” and “the ugly baby.” Feeding the beast is what happens when a company enjoys some success, realizes significant growth, and then has to churn out more and more product to justify its own existence; you have to constantly feed the monster you’ve created. This often results in increased pressure to shorten development times which, in the author’s opinion, almost always leads to a corresponding loss in product quality. “The ugly baby” refers to an idea at conception that is very rough around the edges. They are incomplete and not fully formed. Ideas in this stage are vulnerable to being destroyed and need to be protected and nurtured to survive.\n\n- Change. People fear of it and are resistance to it, often perceiving change as an admission that what thye’ve been doing isn’t really working. They don’t like the confusion, stress, or extra work that often accompanies change. However, change can be vital to growth and the creative process because it’s often necessary to evolve due to the changing conditions, business or otherwise, that surround you.\n\n- Randomness. In business, and in life in general, we should not be fooled to think that we can control every aspect of every situation. However much we think that we are in control of our own destinies we need to recognize that the reality is that a fair amount of our success or failure, more than we often care to admit, is well beyond our control. He also uses this to underscore the idea that all the people in the company has an interest in its success so they should not be prevented or discouraged from making independent decisions because, in his words,”…we must meet unexpected problems with unexpected responses.”\n\n- The Hidden. The hidden are the all the many things that we cannot see that influence our decisions; the unknown problems we have yet to encounter. Catmull states that one of his core management beliefs is “if you don’t try to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill-prepared to lead.”\n\nLater in book the author discusses methods that they have employed at Pixar to prevent these challenges within the organization from impeding collaboration and creativity.\n\n1. Dailies or solving problems together. Collaborative daily meetings with project stakeholders to review and discuss the status of production in order to receive and provide feedback and constructive criticism.\n2. Research Trips. Teams are encouraged to perform real-world research by immersing themselves into subjects and visiting locations in person to promote creativity and authenticity, preventing the finished product from feeling forced or derivative.\n3. The Power of Limits. Priorities and limits need to be set within the context of the tasks at hand and the overall project in order to remain focused and make efficient use of time and resources. Limits can also be beneficial in that they often lead to creative solutions to overcome them.\n4. Integrating Technology and Art. Using all the latest tools and technologies at your disposal to challenge, improve, and spur innovation in the creative process.\n5. Short Experiments. Experimentation often leads to innovation, learning, and the development of skills that can be utilized on larger projects. It also affords a greater creative freedom and the ability to take bigger risks than many larger projects.\n6. Learning to See. Setting aside preconceptions and biases so as not to jump to conclusions in order see something clearly for what it really is, or is not.\n7. Postmortems. An exploratory meeting at the conclusion of a project to discuss what worked, what didn’t, how things could have been done different, and other lessons learned. These are essential components of continuous improvement.\n8. Continuing to Learn. Learning promotes creativity and new ways of thinking. It opens us up to new ideas and possibilities which help reinvigorate the creative process.\n\nUltimately, our author makes the case that it is possible to create a sustainable creative culture. There will be challenges, setbacks, and failures but with the right people and processes in place they can almost always be overcome. There is a great assumption of risk that is married to any creative venture, and Pixar certainly is no exception. While the ideas he has presented create a framework of barriers to creativity and actions Pixar took prevent them, we must remain watchful and vigilant, and the solutions must evolve when needed. When it works it can be a source of great pride and accomplishment. The path isn’t always easy but, as the author states in closing, “…ease isn’t the goal; excellence is.”",
    "If you are looking for a book that tells you about the origin of Pixar, you’re going to be happy to have this book. Likewise, if you’re a 21st century Disney fan, you’ll learn a lot about its recent history, but if you want those things and an understanding of the Wonderful World of Computer-generated animation and the dynamics of managing the creative people who make that happen, THIS is the book you want to read.\n\nSo why did I give it **** instead of *****? I think The book was written five years too early and I wanted to hear more about post-Disney/Pixar merge films, as well as Inside Out, Turning Red, and other recent stories that are creating new standards in animation. There is less discussion of stories and plenty of analysis of corporate wrangling and power.",
    "Beautifully crafted...inspired me to do more and better. Would recommend to all creatives and those like me who don't feel they are creative at all to take a deeper dive.",
    "I’m still reading it but it’s a very slow start, still waiting for it to get good",
    "Creativity, INC. is the best management and leadership book I have read for a long time. Ed Catmull, probably because of his background in storytelling at Pixar, provides three books in one.\n\nThe first is a history of Pixar, which has become a cultural icon. He offers leadership advice based on case studies from Pixar and later in the Pixar and Disney Animation merger / take over. The third storyline is that of Steve Jobs. Steve purchased Pixar and worked with Ed for 25 years before his death. The three story lines are intertwined, which should keep the reader's attention.\n\nThe book isn’t all “mother and apple pie”, Ed points out where corporations go wrong and even admits his and Pixar’s own failings. But for any business you need to be looking for the good and the bad, if you are to have continued success.",
    "Bought the Kindle version after giving away several print copies. Creativity, Inc is an evergreen classic and essential reading for anyone working or interested in creative businesses, high-performance teams, org change and transformation, innovation, digital media, etc. Part biography, part history of animation, part chronicle of founding and growth of Pixar, with a cast of creatives and mavericks, and cameos from Steve Jobs, George Lucas, Peter O'Toole, Mickey Mouse and the luminaries of C20 animation. Meditations on leadership, culture, failure, planning, teams, strategy, and change, written with humility and human warmth. Buy it. Buy two copies because you will want to give one away while you are reading the other. Highly recommended.",
    "I am a big admirer of Pixar films and when I saw the 5 star reviews this looked like a book I had to read. Not wanting to take away anything from everything the author has achieved, this book failed to keep me interested. It is partly historical, partly advice, with a lot of repetition. I hate not finishing books but the best I could do with this one was 50% and then gave up.",
    "I was interested to see how management techniques were applied to a hugely successful and creative hothouse and enjoyed this book immensely.\n\nNicely peppered with anecdotes to flesh out the Pixar development story, perhaps the most striking observation of which is his thinking on creativity itself: “If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.”\n\nI like his view that nothing and nobody should be sacrosanct and believe that many could learn from the Steve Jobs story about being on time for meetings.\n\nAn interesting, educational and entertaining read.",
    "This is the story of Pixar and its founders Steve Jobs, John Lasseter and Ed Catmull. The story tracks the creation of Toy Story and the creation of the worlds first computer-generated animation film. Following the first showing, their hearts dropped. They had achieved a wonderful feat of technical advances and graphical breakthroughs but there was one vital piece missing. There was no story or characters that viewers could empathise with, laugh with, cry with or root for. They needed a storyteller!\n\nToy Story became a huge success and then the next era begins!!!\n\nIt's always an interesting read to appreciate the challenges and highlights entrepreneurs face in establishing new companies. What is insightful in this book is to explore what happens after success in terms of motivation, pressures to deliver again and renewed creativity challenges. How teams react to stepping up into the fray again. Are you a one trick pony?\n\nVery interesting read and a unique perspective from a unique company."

    "Walker is in a category of one when it comes to expertise in small business acquisitions. There isn't even a runner-up.\n\nWalker has a gift for clear communication and teaching. That's on full display in the book, which is a fast read.\n\nI hesitated to write this review because frankly I prefer Walker's work be kept somewhat secret.\n\nBut I have to give credit where credit is due. Book changed course of my life. I implemented the methods, acquired a business, and am now having the time of my life. This is the playbook you need if you want to acquire a small business.",
    "As I prepare to go to the Invest Like a Boss podcast meetup here in Chiang Mai on Jan 3, 2018 - I felt I should catch up on some reading about investing and this one was a new one with amazing reviews so I couldn’t help myself.\n\nBuy Then Build is a book about what the author calls a new trend for entrepreneurs - to be Acquisition Entrepreneurs.\n\nTo start off the book, he makes the case that something like 90% of startups fail, and those that you say succeed simply become small to medium sized enterprises with nothing special. That the ones who win in the startup game are not the entrepreneurs, but the investors. They get to spread their bets across multiple startups and just need one to win, while the entrepreneur is all in on 1 startup with a 90% chance of failure.\n\nSo Walker, the author, says to instead skip past the startup phase and buy an existing business with positive cash flow.\n\nIt makes sense - as he shows the numbers of failures in this stage is something like 5% (95% success rate) so the complete inverse of the startup phase.\n\nPlus, it seems cheap! Paying 2 to 4 times of SDE (seller discretionary earnings) for a company that already has product market fit and is earning positive cashflow - compare that amount of investment with what you would need to do it from scratch.\n\nThe real eye opener for me was that you can finance these acquisitions with the bank. And then pay yourself salary while also paying back the bank loan - and keep 100% of the company /equity (as its a loan not equity investment).\n\nThroughout the book you get step by step instructions and almost the exact wording to use when talking to brokers and the other players in the acquisition game.\n\nMy favorite part is that the author says there is tons of opportunity to be creative in these companies you acquire - and that you need to know yourself and your own strengths. Not to look for a company by industry, but more for what suits your needs as an entrepreneur / investor.\n\nAnd what is even cooler, you can use that cashflow to invest in growth and leverage the existing customer base on a new technology. As all so many times when starting a company you are scrambling to get customers why not by an existing company, get financing, and then plug in your technology idea into it with its existing client base.\n\nSeems like a fun game that can be repeated every five years or so (plugs into a recent post I talked about 5 year plans 999999) and you can focus on your own strengths each time - applied to existing customer bases which need your skill set.\n\nMy only concern, as an American in Asia, I probably can’t tap into these bank loan options. But for many of you reading this - if you have good credit and maybe a home to put up and your personal guarantee (as a US person) it can be a great way to jump right into entrepreneurship.",
    "Love the comparisons to tech and startup world and the detail of where to begin. It’s been a excellent guide for us so far.",
    "Anyone considering a startup should read this book. Acquisition entrepreneurship is an alternate path to achieve what one hopes to in a startup.",
    "I believe this is my first Amazon review of a book that I have read. I read a lot of books, but none have compelled me to tell other people about it like Buy Then Build, by Walker Deibel.\n\nAfter spending almost two decades working for other people, I took a leap of faith and purchased a company in the months leading up to the fall of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a pretty major recession. This was the beginning of an entrepreneurial journey that has included growing that original business by opening another location, starting up my own consulting business from scratch, joining another entrepreneur in launching a startup with several partners, and acquiring a manufacturing business.\n\nWhy do I tell you this as part of my review? Because Buy Then Build tells the story of the most efficient way to become an entrepreneur and a business owner/leader - buy the business from someone else. In his book, Walker takes you through all of the steps necessary to become an Acquisition Entrepreneur - The Opportunity (of business ownership and the demographic change in America), The Evaluation (of yourself and the market itself), The Analysis (of the target business), and The Execution (of the deal and running your new business).\n\nWalker does an amazing job of documenting all the steps, but also helping you navigate the landmines that litter the landscape as you consider becoming a business owner. His details cover self-assessments, working with business brokers and \"deal flow,\" building projections and forecasts, drafting a Letter of Intent, conducting Due Diligence, closing the deal, and running your new business in the first 90 days. I've done all of these things, but I never called it Acquisition Entrepreneurship. And I never documented the process.\n\nI am not a fast reader, but I couldn't put this book down. If you are interested in becoming a business owner or growing your current business through acquisition, I strongly encourage you to read Walker's well-written book!\n\nWhat about my headline? Read the book to learn about the $10 Trillion opportunity, but let's keep it a secret so we can take advantage of these conditions!",
    "Can you succeed by buying a business?\n\nAs a business advisor and coach, I have no doubt that management skills are transferrable across businesses and different trades and industries. However I usually work with business owners who have plenty of detailed knowledge of their own industry and I think this is vital. There is a balance to bringing in fresh eyes and new business ideas and combining them with deep knowledge of the customers and capabilities involved.\n\nIf I had my time again, I like to think I'd buy businesses, improve them and either sell them again or keep them if I found the trade interesting .\n\nIndeed, for many years I described myself as a \"frustrated entrepreneur\" who was on the lookout for an opportunity but I wanted something where I had a deep passion. I never found anything and an assessment (Kolbe) showed me I was more a business architect than builder. I got my kicks from thinking about a business conceptually. The advisor role suits me because I don't feel a need to take control and make the decisions.\n\nIs buying a business with the intention of building it into something bigger and better right for you?\n\nTo quote from the book...\n\n\"You need to commit your time to taking action. You need to commit to investing your own money and betting on yourself. You need to be willing to create a business plan and pitch it to banks or other potential investors. Finally, you need to be comfortable and willing to take calculated risks.\"\n\nThe book provides the roadmap to guide you.\n\nI was pleased by this quote\n\"For the acquisition entrepreneur to find the right company and have success running it, they too need to have all three attributes working in harmony: Attitude, Aptitude, and Action.\"\n\nThis is the essential foundation. It is not simple and it is not for everyone. One of the big surprises in store for a new start-up entrepreneur is how much he or she has to learn about so many different topics. It can feel overwhelming. But the start-up has the advantage of starting slowly. The acquisition entrepreneur is thrown in at the deep-end.\n\nThe book goes into detail about having the right attitude and aptitude and action refers to finding an opportunity where the actions needed suit your preferences. It's obvious but who wants to do work they hate?\n\nThere is a guidance about how to put together the deal and due diligence but professional advice is essential.\n\nAfter that, the book looks at what you do in your first few months as the new owner. This is sensible but priorities will depend on the situation. A turnaround requires earlier fundamental changes than a business where you expect to make incremental growth.\n\nCriticism and Concerns\n*************************\n1) I felt the author was selling the idea hard. The claimed 98% success rate is spurious and especially when compared against the abysmal failure rates of start-ups. Big companies have a dreadful record with acquisitions.\n\n2) The book indicates that if you invest 10, you can borrow 90, meaning you can buy a business for 100. This seems very optimistic to me for the UK and is based on what the SBA will do in the USA.\n3) I feel the importance of experience is underplayed. Switching to new customer markets and operating capabilities together is risky and is why diversification often fails.\n4) I'd like to see more emphasis on risk management.\n\nConclusion\n***********\nBuying a business isn't new. It's long been a way for people to step into business ownership.\n\nInstead of starting with a blank sheet and inventing, you take a business and adapt it.\n\nI like this book and was torn between 4 and 5 stars. I may be back to upgrade it.\n\nPaul Simister helps frustrated business owners who are stuck get unstuck.",
    "Some useful information here, particularly for people completely new to business. 3 stars because I doubt the book was proof-read, it contains way too many grammatical errors. Also, I wish the author went into more detail in how to find target companies in practice and spent some time discussing the details of acquisitions/exits he has been involved with. A lot of the content appears theoretical which you can learn from any half decent business course.",
    "Great examples which boos confidence and overall it has the intended effect, to convey the idea that buying is better than starting a business. However, as a UK buyer I found this book to be too USA centric.",
    "Very easy to read at a surprisingly fast pace as it’s interesting and flows well. Good level of teaching knowledge, right on point for what I’m looking for.\n\nOne problem, my pet hate is over use of acronyms and this book is riddled with them. Not too bad if there’s a glossary but there isn’t!!!\nNext edition needs a glossary of terms which is key to widening acceptance beyond business masters students.",
    "Books on the topic of search funds and acquisition entrepreneurship are few and far between, so finding this book was a lucky stroke. It was recommended by a friend who is considering launching a search fund, and we both find the book incredibly practical. The examples are mostly from the US, but the wider insights and terminology can definitely be applied at an international scale. It's also full of specific examples of successful acquisitions, which adds to the already strong credibility from the author.\n\nOne of the best books I've read this year, I fully recommend it!"

    "This is how I received the book.",
    "If you need to brush up on writing skills or learn how to write better, this book is very helpful. Many great examples provided.",
    "Ok so I have bought so many books from Amazon because I didn’t learn much in school (I’m a very slow learner) I’m a 40 year old trying to get into college. I didn’t know how to use punctuation marks and I also didn’t realize how bad my English was before reading this book. It really did help a lot and I find myself thinking about words and this book everytime I speak or write lol so it does really sink in. The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because I do think that they could have explained things in a better way which makes some pages a bit confusing, but if your English is as bad as mines and need somewhere to start, then this book is for you.",
    "I chose this book over others because it’s reviews seemed good and the exercises shown in the pictures seemed valuable. The graphic design of it is bright and fun, and I really liked it form when I first opened it. I’m not an english as a second language learner, english is my first language, but the book is written in a way that i understood concepts much better. I read through the authors remarks in the front, and I’m glad he included further reading as I am still looking for other review materials.\n\nI’m surprised this book is sold for 15 dollars because the pages are high quality, colorful, and of thick paper quality. The font is easy to read. The author really outdid himself with this. I’m glad I bought this book.\n\nOn the further reading page, he promotes his site, but he still includes recommendations to learn more which is great and makes it easier to learn more. Excellent book would recommend",
    "Me gustó mucho la forma de abordar las diferentes reglas gramaticales, los ejemplos, las explicaciones y la diversidad de temas que se dan de manera progresiva. Realmente me ayudó mucho.",
    "Me gusta porque es práctico y bien redactado, gracias por apoyarme a cumplir mi meta de ser bilingüe.\nGracias.\nCarlos Sifuentes",
    "Contextual content writing is part of my job. I was hoping this book will helps us understand how grammar may affect the meaning of otherwise very similar sentences, like the example given at the end of the introduction in the book.\n\nHowever, this is still a book focused on writing and grammar references, written in a friendlier way. The entire second section is writing prompts with no review on grammar, for things like school essays or a work email, so pretty useless to me. It’s a little less “real-world application” than I imagined, perhaps because it’s focused on writing exercises and grammar rules rather than using grammar to support writing decisions. It’s a subtle difference, and what I was thinking probably isn’t an easy way to write a grammar book. If this is not what you’re looking for anyway, the other reviews will give a good sense of the strengths of this book. It’s still a more wholistic approach to understanding grammar.",
    "I like that works book",
    "I bought this under the impression that this was for English grammar… it’s for American English… it doesn’t state that in the first chapter\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIt quickly goes over all the concepts you need for a basic understanding of grammar, a perfect refresher or quick guide. If you start reading this book expecting deep and detailed expectations you would be disappointed - good contents page, no index. All of the information is well organised and easy to follow whilst being clear and concise.\n\nThere are some cheat sheets that could be helpful also there are some short discussion pieces about language changing in lieu of technology. There is also a page for further reading.\n\nThe activities range from poor to okay. The vast majority of the quizzes are open and work more as a general development tool for your writing as opposed to learning correct grammar. I wouldn’t buy this book for the activities however they could be good for lesson inspiration.\n\nThe target demographic, as stated in the first chapter, are educationalists. This book is not really designed for teachers looking for CPD or using this as a classroom tool. However, a teacher may find use if they haven’t taught English in a while and wants to brush-up quickly or have a full glossary sat on their desk.",
    "After I returned to study at the college an ESOL course to improve my English I finally get how bad my grammar is, so I bought this book for self-study and revising. It's pretty good but it makes a lot of content easier and misses some explanation. Overall is sufficient for its purpose.",
    "I got this for my daughter and it is a good buy.\n\nIts an easy to follow book with exercises and with the answers. She found it far better than another book we got and she has been working through the book and exercises and making good progress.",
    "Bought for someone and they found it very helpful.",
    "The book is excellent and it’s help me a lot . all my friends want me to get them One as a Christmas gift ."

    "The practical application of the laws to my leadership story is so natural. The principles can be applied to any yow of leader regardless of qualification and experience.",
    "We had to read this book for a leadership class. This review is from the short report I had to write:\n\nAs the name implies, the book is Mr. Maxwell's take on several characteristics that an individual must develop to be a good leader. I wouldn't call it a groundbreaking work because the majority of these 'laws' are well addressed in other works. However, I found there are two commendable qualities to Mr. Maxwell's book: 1) he has done a very good job supporting each of his laws with real world examples of how leaders from all walks of life fulfilled each law and 2) he writes it in a way where he shows that these laws can be beneficial people of all walks of life (e.g, government, church, industry). And I agree with his strategy: good leaders are needed everywhere, not just in the professional realm where leader development seems to be most encouraged.\n\nThere are a few laws that marry up well that l address below:\nThe Law of Process: to sum up this law, one is not going to become a leader overnight. It is going to take assessing your capabilities, then committing to working a bit each day on improving. This law pairs well with the Law of Sacrifice. Based on the principle of cost of opportunity: to become a better leader, you are going to have to give up time to work on improving yourself. Your are not going to become a good leader without loosing opportunities in other areas of your life.\n\nThe Law of Addition: Good leaders don't define success in what benefits them personally. They view success on how well they have done in building other people up within their circles of influence. This law pairs well with the Law of Explosive Growth: once you help build leaders, you make sure to inspire them to do the same for others. With every new generation, you achieve exponential results.\n\nThe Law of Solid Ground: This law regards how important it is to build trust and be an agent of trust, to maintain integrity in what you do and make sure you have character. This law pairs well with the Law of The Picture, which basically is an expression of making sure you 'walk the walk' and ensuring that your actions are consistent with your words.\n\nTo offer a critique, I believe the book missed the mark in a couple of areas:\n1) Here we have another book where the author is a little too preoccupied with making sure the number of laws that he has identified total up to some arbitrary number that he feels may have appeal to the readers. In the introduction, he even expresses that he figured out that two laws could be removed due to assumed incorporation into other laws, then conveniently comes up with two additional laws to maintain the total of 21 in a future revision.\n\n2) As demonstrated above in the pairing opportunities that I presented, I believe that there is more redundancy in these laws. A few seem to be re-statements or further expressions of other laws.",
    "I bought this book just coming off of reading John Maxwell'S 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth and loved it! I recommend this one, have to several friends, and see myself coming back to it over and over.\n\nThis one was the Polar opposite. While there is a few good nuggets here and there, I didn't get past chapter 4. It's literally all anecdotes and random stories. They tie in, but it's enough to get irritating, being on every page. He lists these self appointed \"laws\" but very little about what they mean in detail and how to apply them to leadership.\n\nThere are a lot of plugs to his other books as other reviews have mentioned, but I could get past that if there was more meat to the book. Everything in it, honestly, felt like it could have been written in a strong outline.",
    "Great book. Lots og useful information. Would recomend to anyone in leadership.",
    "John Maxwell’s masterpiece!",
    "This is a good book for anyone interested in leadership and it covers all sorts of positions and situations in which leaders may find themselves. There are 21 laws that Maxwell describes simply and with concrete examples, and, for the most part, anyone who has been in leadership positions will agree with them. One of the irrefutable laws, The Law of Victory, was one of those laws I did not buy into. Great leaders sometimes need to accept defeat especially if it is the best for the people under the leader. I am sure tyrants and despots would disagree with me, and Maxwell was probably not thinking of them when he wrote this book, but come on...you can't always win.\nOverall it is a good book for leadership.",
    "My first kindle book. I have the hard copy of an old edition, but loved the book so much I wanted to get the new one to review this timeless leadership book.",
    "Very practical. Great insights for everyone. You will go back to it over and over again. You can put the principles into practice immediately",
    "Such wisdom",
    "A definite must for all aspiring leaders",
    "Great info but find the questions he asks you to write out answers to are mostly to reiterate what you read....some make you think but most are just to confirm the details of what you just read. Of course I am only half way through book...so far though a pretty helpful read.",
    "I'm doing this work book presently and I'm glad.\nI'm a 'follow my heart' gal and it's helping me see my heart from an external point of view instead of my own.",
    "- easy reading\n- good book for beginner leaders\n- excelent examples of leadership\n- Essential reading to develop your leadership."

    "Tallamy’s work in awesome, I have Bringing Nature Home as well and love that book. The reasoning, logic, wow factor is all there for Nature’s Best and very interesting. But he does go off on some rants in the first half that didn’t seem needed. But otherwise, it is a great book for those who are already putting native plants in their yards. I would not recommend it to people who are new to gardening or new to native plants—it’s a bit too advanced for that because he could make a new gardener think that they have to do it right or not at all. At the end he’s a bit more encouraging to people who have never done native planting before by saying that you can use a phased approach. Like many gardening/nature books, this is eastern US focused while I’m in the dry west and removing trees for fire safety and to reduce competition for the little soil moisture there is. There are not resources for other ecosystems—again that’s why I give it only 4 stars and would recommend to the advanced gardener and the choir rather than newbies.",
    "Douglas Tallamy lays out a fairly grim situation with incredible hope and encouragement that homeowners can make a difference. This book is an excellent resource with actionable strategies for impacting our ecosystem by avoiding such culprits as lawns and invasive plants, as well as things we can do, such as increasing native plants, installing water features, and so much more. I wish everyone would read this book!",
    "This book hopefully puts the nail in the coffin of staid, sterile and monoculture fescue lawns. This book should be required reading for every lawn care company, landscaper and HOA board member that proclaims to value nature and “property values”. This book finally provides some meaningful parameters for proper native plant selection for not only adding real aesthetic value ( and not the false variety conveyed by the contrived, manicured modern lawn), but preseving a beneficial and productive ecosystem that can really combat the effects of not only climate change but the degradation of countless bird, insect and indigenous plant species.",
    "So many good ideas in the name of conservation. We have already attended to these changes on our 23 acres. Even the smallest lots can make the same changes attracting birds, monarch butterflies, bumble bees and dragon flies. Keeping pesticides out and native plants and trees in will change your yard to the welcoming place you want it to be.",
    "Great thanks",
    "I learned so much from this book that I had to buy one for someone who just bought some land.",
    "Fantastic book for anyone who is serious about helping our planet heal from the destruction humans have caused. No space is too small to make a difference.",
    "Tallamy lays out strategic steps for how the regular homeowner (yes, that's right, boring people like you and me!) can - and SHOULD - assist in the reversal of the demise of our world.",
    "Very informative, if you live in the USA.",
    "My husband was interested in this book so I bought it for him. He loved it. He devoured it in two sittings. Many of the things it talked about my husband has implemented in our yard with his new found interest in gardening and his long family history of environmentalists. If your interested in what you can do to help the environment he recommends this book. He says it is well written so as to keep you reading.",
    "Very readable. It’s not enough to feed birds seeds or fat in winter, we need to grow native plants that are food for caterpillars that in turn are food for baby birds, to reduce the loss of birds and insects. Trees such as oaks, native cherries and willows are particularly productive. Reduce the area of your lawn, don’t spray, replace outdoor lights with motion sensitive ones - these are some of the suggestions to reverse the loss of species.",
    "This book makes me feel even more confident about getting rid of ALL the lawn on our property five years ago. It's not lost on me that \"lawn\" and \"yawn\" rhyme. Every year we enjoy an ever-changing nature show from our front porch and back deck.",
    "I have gardened for years and this book was an eye opener on how each of us can contribute to bringing our native lands back to what they once were in our own backyards, to restore our ecosystem."

    "If you are in technology but not software development not all of the guidance is going to be relatable. The first few chapters are on the relationship of you being a contributor and dealing with a tech manager. There are a few chapters in the middle with really useful ideas for new managers of a team. Then the book inexplicably goes down the management of multiple teams (director, vp, c-level). Why like a third of a book for people just transitioning into tech management is spent on roles you won’t be in for years or decades down the road is beyond me.\n\nRecommendation - look for a used copy in good condition and don’t pay more than $10 for it.",
    "This book is specifically about managing software engineers. For that purpose this book is more concrete and practical than any other I have read. The concepts are explained well and backed up by good examples.",
    "Not a bad book. My favorite part is on pages 40-42 where the author explains the imaginary vs. real life of an individual contributor vs. manager. Other things I liked are e.g., tips like developing some redundancy so that no one is indispensible and that when you get into the big leagues you might need to reach out to someone externally for coaching - you no longer have a manager, you have a boss. I mostly learnt (and still learning) much of the advice in the book through practice rather than formal training or education. I take off one star from the book because its mostly 101 and skips the really difficult parts of management much of which I think has to be learnt from coaching and experience. It does not skip them entirely but IMO lacks better coverage and explanation through specific real-world examples.\n\n* How to handle disagreements and conflict? The answer to this varies depending upon who you are dealing with in the organization.\n\n* How to handle insubordination or someone undermining you?\n\n* How to handle non-performing individuals and teams?\n\nOften management has two sides - the one that is taught in books etc. and the one that is practiced.\nIn short, I feel management is closely tied to understanding human psychology and psychology of collective individuals (teams). To become effective manager you have to master human psychology. That is what its all about.\n\nOverall recommended.",
    "I am an experienced technology executive and consultant for engineering managers and execs. Based on my experience, this book is now the best book you can buy to learn modern engineering management.\n\nPrevious contenders have included Peopleware, High-Output Management, The Mythical Man-Month, Good To Great, and others you've probably heard of. They are fine books, but they are either somewhat out of date, overly general, or a combination of both. This book is different. Fournier's book is a comprehensive overview of all the roles on the career path of modern technical management (starting from \"senior engineer mentoring an intern\" all the way up to CTO) and how to deal with the challenges at every step of the way.\n\nWhat sets this book apart, other than being comprehensive, is that it is the product of direct and highly relevant experience. Fournier has worked at huge companies, small startups, and medium-sized companies, all in hyper-competitive industry settings. You've probably read other management books and it always goes like this: they give you a piece of general advice about how to deal with an issue. You try it (assuming it is even specific enough to put into action and isn't just a feel-good HR platitude), you run into a snag, and now the advice is useless because the rosy assurances in the book about how employees were going to act reasonably didn't really work. You throw the book away and think there is something wrong with you because everyone keeps on talking about how the book is great and it's just your fault that you couldn't make this great advice work.\n\nFournier's advice is not like that.\n\nShe starts with the general outlines of the strategy, but then tells you about times when she had to confront the issue herself, how she tried to apply the strategy and screwed up (there are instances in the book where she openly admits \"The first time I tried this I fell flat on my face\"), what kinds of problems kept the strategy from working, how she modified the strategy and overcame the problems, and finally and most importantly, wraps up with a summary about how context and trade-offs affect how you apply the advice. Acknowledging and explaining how common variations and implementation details determine how a general strategy will play out is what makes this book unusually useful and relevant.\n\nBecause everyone's job and situation are a little bit different, Fournier does an excellent job of breaking down broad strategies into their core principles, while separating out which details you can change based on individual situations, so that you can choose between trade-offs when you apply the strategy to the specific challenge you are confronting.\n\nLastly, this book will give you confidence. Confidence that you're not alone, that others have faced the same problems and surmounted them, that you can do it too. Confidence that you can screw something up but still pick up the pieces and try again, that you'll still get it right the second or third time, and that you are going to get to where you want to go.\n\nThis book is the product of years of tough lessons and hard-won success. Buy it. You won't regret it.",
    "This is an incredible book, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is at all interested in technical leadership at any level.\n\nIt focuses very specifically on the challenges of combining technical focus with leadership and/ or management, and steps through roles from hands-on development, through mentoring, tech lead and various levels of engineering manager all the way up to CTO. Along the way, it gives a realistic and well-thought-out sense of what these roles are (and are not), how they differ from lower roles and from subtly different roles at a similar level, and how to succeed at them.\n\nThe most interesting thing I took from it though was that the understanding you can gain about the hierarchy of technical leadership roles is useful at all levels, including what we would call \"individual contributor\" roles (i.e. doing technical work with no direct reports). Engineers at a relatively early stage in their careers can benefit from the first few chapters, which cover what to expect from your own manager, how to start mentoring and how to consider whether long-term you are more interested in management or technical tracks. Equally, having done some low-level management over the last couple of years and now seeking to return to more of a senior technical/ architecture role, I still found the later chapters (about senior tech management roles) fascinating, because I know that even if I never take on those exact roles, understanding the responsibilities and thought processes of those who have them will make me much more effective in working with them and advancing my own ideas.",
    "As an engineer who has stayed in engineering for the last 20 years this book was a read through the many episodes of my career and those of my colleagues.\nIt is a map of non engineering career moves in an engineering career.\nIt moves through many stages, however uncomfortable, an engineer may find themselves in. How to seek out more responsibility, how to just quietly test the water, or jump head first into a more senior role.\nToo many engineers seem to move in senior positions now that simply haven't put the time in to understand the nuances of business, of people, and of social interaction on all levels. Just because you're an amazing python programmer shouldn't be a promotion to looking after the team.\nAll management should make their engineers read this who aspire to lead, no matter if in projects or with people.",
    "This book is written for tech people. It approaches all subjects from that angle which is great. If you have just started managing, or want to take a peek into management, or have even managed for several years, this is a great book to read. It is like a handbook that you can refer to when you have doubts or questions about challenging situations.",

    "Really well written and inspiring to anyone who loves hospitality.",
    "Setting the Table by Danny Meyer provides lots of value for business leaders. I ranked this book five stars based on the value alone. The reader should be apprised that the book is written as a memoir of Mr. Meyer's experience in the restaurant business.\n\nAs a business leader you should study excellence in your industry and outside of your industry and there are numerous take-aways in Setting the Table that can be applied to any business. Here are ten excellent points I took away from Mr. Meyer's book.\n\n1. The Excellence Reflex - \"A natural reaction to fix something that isn't right, or to improve something that could be better.\" The excellent reflex is a natural reaction that some people have and cannot be taught. Meyer trains his leaders how hire those that have it.\n\n2. Employees can be categorized as Overwhelmers, Whelmers, and Underwhelmers. It is easy to identify Underwhelmers and get rid of them. The most dangerous employees are the Whelmers because \"they infuse an organization and its staff with mediocrity...and send a dangerous message to your staff and guests that \"average\" is acceptable.\"\n\n3. Coaching is correcting with dignity.\n\n4. You obtain valuable leadership skills while managing volunteers. It requires you to consistently motivate employees beyond their earnings.\n\n5. Create a sense of \"shared ownership\" with your customers by taking an interest in them and making them feel important. They will view you as a partner instead of a provider.\n\n6. ABCD - Always Be Collecting Dots. You should aggressively collect lots of little information about your customer (dots) as they interact with your product or service. Then make the connection between the dots as a mechanism to improve your product or service to all customers.\n\n7. Customers may love your product or service but the relationship that they have with you or your employees is what builds loyalty. Therefore you should take every opportunity to exceed expectations to create a lasting relationship.\n\n8. Enlightened Hospitality - \"We would define our successes and our failures in terms of the degree to which we had championed, first, one another and then our guests, community, suppliers and investors.\" This is an extremely powerful concept and is rooted in the integrity theme Meyer has throughout the book. You can't expect employees that don't treat each other with respect, who can't be hospitable with one another to then turn around and treat the customer with respect and high levels of hospitality a customer deserves. Poor relationships internal to the organization migrate to poor relationships external to the organization. Ultimately being last on the list benefits the investor by long term organizational success.\n\n9. Judge your staff on 51 percent emotional job performance and 49 percent technical job performance. You can always teach technical while emotional is much harder if not impossible to develop. Lack of emotional job performance skills destroys teams and alienates customers.\n\n10. \"The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled\" and \"the worst mistake is not to figure out some way to end up in a better place after having made a mistake.\"\n\nThe ten points above are obviously more powerful in the context of the book when illustrated with Mr. Meyer's stories and experiences.\n\nDr. James T. Brown PMP PE CSP\nAuthor, The Handbook of Program Management",
    "In my soul I believe that making people feel special is a competitive advantage, whether that is with employees or with clients.\nDo your clients feel like guests?\n\nI think people who work in the hospitality (particularly hotels) look at their jobs in one of two ways, most see their jobs as helping someone to have a good night’s sleep, in a clean and nice room. Some others see their job as making sure guests are relaxed, that guests enjoy their city, and that guests don’t have to worry about a THING. The latter are the 5%’ers Danny speaks about.\n\nThe book starts off a lot about Danny’s background, it was admittedly slow, but chapter 4 is when it started sinking in for me, so if you get it start there if you are pressed for time.\n\n“The opportunity to make someone feel special is all around you, just look UNDER the rocks”\n\nIn this chapter it opens with a story about turning over rocks, and Danny talks about how he sees it as his job to turn over the rocks of his business, look deeper than what is on the surface to understand more about your clients. As usual learning to watch and listen is again showing itself as a critical skill in making someone feel special.\n\nLater he goes on to speak about 51%'ers...\nThe 51%’ers have 5 core characteristics:\n1 – Optimistic Warmth\n2 – Intelligence\n3 – Work Ethic\n4 – Empathy\n5 – Self awareness and Integrity\n\nI liked how chapter 9 opened up with “Constant, Gentle Pressure”, Danny states that the core of effective leadership lies in:\n1 – Setting a clear vision for your team so they know where you are taking them\n2 – Hold people accountable to consistent standards of excellence\n3 – Communicate, repeatedly, a well-defined set of cultural priorities and non-negotiable values\n\nThroughout the book there were times I found myself nodding and saying \"yup\" again and again.\n\nDanny has struggled with scaling his business and not losing his soul in the process and goes into great detail on what creates scale that doesn't get too far away from core principles.\n\nLastly he ends the book with this reminder:\n“The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled.”\n\nIn other words we are all going to make mistakes, that’s a given, it’s how you handle them that is the key. The concept of writing the great last chapter on every mistake is the KEY. When a mistake is made, it’s made, but the future is NOT made yet. How can you take a mistake that happened and turn it into the great last chapter in the story with a client? You can only turn things around when you genuinely care about the person, and righting the wrong.",
    "Inspiring book, I have taken a lot of tips from it as a restaurant manager. I do think some parts are a bit waffly and some parts of the book were more just about Danny and his life that I couldn't take any inspiration or information from. But dotted around are some great key points to remember and I am glad I read this even with mixed feelings.",
    "While the first few chapters are rather dull - they've just aboutf his family and growing up - the rest is rather excellent and contains lessons that can be applied to all careers. I'm certainly glad he took the time to write it.",
    "I enjoyed the entire book, completely lost myself in it and the vivid descriptions of an excellent fellow restaurateur. Wish I'd read it before starting my restaurant 8 years ago. Would've saved me a few mistakes and pitfalls many new business owners make.\n\nA must read for anyone thinking of starting a business in the catering trade.",
    "This is a very compelling case for how to deliver exceptional service no matter what the product. The logic is clear, the execution is clear, and the writing about it is clear. I found it a very useful book. Nothing is surprising but Danny Meyer comes across as a an exceptional leader and someone anyone should be happy to work for.",
    "Everyone in catering should be given a copy of this book to read before they ever step on the floor I have been in catering all my life and still find reading it inspires me to go the extra mile"

    "If you’re worried that a book with this title by a prominent retired General is just another version of “Super leadership secrets of the Navy SEALs” don’t worry.\n\nThe lessons in Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World were learned in war, a crucible that produces a lot of innovation. In this case, the innovation is in thinking about what most business writers call “management” or “leadership” or “organization,” and it’s one of the best books I’ve read on those topics.\n\nA decade ago, Gary Hamel and Bill Breen asked us to cast our mind “forward a decade or two” and ask what management will be like then. That was in their excellent book The Future of Management. Guess what? They got some things right, but missed a lot because they were the early warning system. Team of Teams is the latest report on today’s best thinking.\n\nThe through-line of the book is about the formation and evolution of the Joint Special Operations Task Force. It is the story of the quest for members of that task force to find and defeat Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. It is not a story about a planned change.\n\nWhat McChrystal and his co-authors write about is an iterative evolutionary process of developing to understand and adapt to defeat an organization that was better suited for the modern battlefield than they were. It is also the story of how General Stanley McChrystal’s understanding of his role as the task force leader evolved. If he had stopped there, this would be another “this is how I did it” book. But McChrystal supplemented his experience with extensive research.\n\nTwo Different Models\n\nIn the beginning, the Task Force confronted Al-Qaeda in Iraq with a typical Industrial Age organization. It was designed to thrive in a complicated world, where relationships were linear and organizations strove primarily for efficiency. For that reason, the Task Force, like the rest of the Army, was hierarchical, with decisions moving up and down the chain of command. The task force relished planning, and had a culture of making decisions at the top.\n\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq was very different. Their organization was suited to today’s complex world. They shared information horizontally in an essentially flat organization. They were resilient because they were made up of many small units with freedom to act as fast as information-sharing suggested it was a good idea.\n\nIn the beginning, Al-Qaeda in Iraq had the upper hand. Chapter 1 of the book outlines that situation.\n\n“To win, we had to change. Surprisingly, that change was less about tactics or new technology than it was about the internal structure and culture of our force – in other words, our approach to management.”\n\nThe Task Force structure was the typical Army structure. It’s also the typical organizational structure since the Industrial Revolution. Those organizations are great at efficient execution of known and repeatable processes. McChrystal and his team concluded that efficiency is no longer enough.\n\nThe challenge for the Task Force and for most organizations today is that technological changes have speeded up the world and made it more interdependent. In the old industrial world, complicated challenges would succumb to careful analysis. That made them predictable. Today, a fast-paced interdependent world is a complex phenomenon. Analysis doesn’t help much here. Instead of planning and prediction, what the task force found that it needed was resilience and adaptability. That requires a different style of management as well as different structure.\n\nMcChrystal compares a command structure to a team. In a command, hierarchy, planning and executing the plan were the way to succeed. But, if you’ve ever been part of a great team, either a military team or a sports team or a business team, you know that teams are qualitatively different from commands.\n\nTeams are usually small but characterized by trust and information-sharing. Great teams grow by collaborating in several successful ventures. Working together is how teams learn what teamwork is for them. Team members learn each other’s strengths and weaknesses and tendencies. That’s why, on most great teams, there is almost a sense that each team member knows what the others are thinking.\n\nTransparency and information-sharing do not come naturally to most organizations, or even to most teams. For the task force to achieve what it needed to achieve, it had to go through several iterations where everything, ultimately, came up for review. By the end of the series of changes, the physical spaces where the teams worked were different, and almost every procedure had been changed in some way.\n\nMcChrystal uses SEAL teams as his model for a great team. The book describes basic SEAL training and team development, and in the process, gives a different picture than most treatments of the SEALS. McChrystal and his team point out that the primary purpose of SEAL training is not to develop super fit warriors as much as it is to develop the interdependence and trust you need to function effectively as an elite combat team. Again and again, the book returns to trust and transparency and collaboration as keys to the way organizations can work in today’s environment.\n\nOther books that I’ve read have done a good job of describing elements of the kind of team organization that McChrystal and his co-authors are outlining. This book is different in two important ways. First, the book describes the development of team thinking in an organization that had to adapt to win. What results is a real-world example of actual changes that almost certainly would not have happened if some planning committee had tried to come up with them.\n\nThe second thing the book does is bring in research in many different fields to explain why some of the changes they made in a process of trial and learning work the way they do. What that means for you, the reader, is that you don’t have to look at McChrystal’s experience and the team he and his colleagues developed as the only way things can work. You can learn from their experience, but adapt to your experience because of the additional insights the book brings you.\n\nThere’s another big benefit to this book. Most of the key points about what makes a great team were things we already knew. McChrystal’s book puts them into a framework that’s helpful, but the book goes on to talk about how you expand that sense of trust and that transparency to a larger organization.\n\nThe truth is that one reason teams can have the transparency and trust they do is that they’re small. Most combat teams are six to eight people at the most. The largest athletic teams may have 85 players, but only a core of maybe twenty work together regularly enough to develop a team chemistry. McChrystal and his co-authors describe techniques that can expand the trust, transparency, agility, and resilience model to a larger organization. That, alone is worth the price of the book, but you wouldn’t understand it without the 130-some pages that come before it.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf you’re interested in or concerned about the ways organizations must change to be effective in a complex and fast-moving world, this book is a must-read. If you want a good study of team dynamics, this book will be worth your time. It will also be a good read for you if you’re intrigued with the military aspects of this, how the Joint Special Operations Task Force adapted to be more effective in Iraq.\n\nOverall, Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World is the best answer I’ve seen so far to the question Gary Hamel and Bill Breen asked a decade ago.",
    "Team of Teams offers insights into the modern practice of leadership and management required to navigate and succeed in this complex world. The book is not a military history, but instead a concise and exceptionally “fun to read” collection of insightful ideas told through entertaining stories ranging from industry to hospital emergency rooms. I recommend it for leaders and associates from all types of organizations who need to break down the effects of siloed teams in which information flow and decision making is ineffective in today’s increasingly complex environment. If you are working your teams harder and putting more resources against a problem that isn’t improving, READ this book and be prepared to look closely in the mirror.\n\nThe discussions in the book are grounded in organizational management theory and leadership methods, but along the way gives a once in a lifetime look at the inside of the most storied Special Operations Forces (SOF) unit in existence today. This is not a book about the latest way to become a great leader. In fact it’s about becoming the kind of senior leader that can develop and sustain an entire workforce of great leaders. The lessons the authors put forward to challenge the typical (and often failing) organizational models and leadership approaches were paid for in blood over the last decade.\n\nI do not come at this review as a scholar of organizational management but rather as a participant and recipient of the Team of Teams approach in the military where I was a leader for over 20 years. I have known the author for more than 2 decades having served as a front line Soldier and leader in his unit and also as his assistant/confidante/advisor during his most senior command. Stan, along with his 3 co-authors, believes that the world is now so complex (vice complicated) that the old models of command and control are extinct. They are so passionate about this evolution that they have started a successful consulting firm to share their lessons. I have worked with 90 plus U.S. and international organizations in and out of government and I cannot think of one that would not benefit from this study.\n\nAn alternate title to this book might have been Trust and Purpose meets Empowered Execution. The Task Force’s journey towards shared consciousness and smart autonomy starts in 2003 with the stunning realization by the commander of the world’s most precise and lethal Counter-Terrorism Task Force that they were losing the strategic war against Al Qaeda. From there the authors interlace examples and case studies of organizational models, leadership techniques, and technological advances from a myriad of areas. They include weather forecasting, basketball and soccer, engineering marvels, big data, airline customer service, aircraft crews, NASA, SEAL training, plastic surgeons at the Boston Marathon bombing, GM versus Ford, MIT studies, and the enduring effects of Ritz Carlton and Nordstrom. My favorite example is the Star Wars bar comparison.\n\nThe discussions found in the various chapters of the book are wide-ranging but relevant to leading all organizations in this modern world. The following should be of interest to today’s leaders: the difference between complicated and complex environments; how having more information available does not improve prediction nor mean lead to smarter decisions at the top; Taylorisms and efficiency ideals may actually cost you more than they save; the ‘need to know’ fallacy; the value of using your best people as ‘liaison officers’ or ‘embeds’; how resilient people make organizations stronger because they can adapt to changing environments; learning from your adversary is time well spent--they might have a better organizational model not necessarily better people; how to delegate authority to take action until you are uncomfortable; how to build trust and a shared awareness of the big picture; ‘eyes on, hands off’ leadership; and the difference between creating Strategic Corporals and an organization full of Lord Horatio Nelsons.\n\nThe book carries you forward in time to see how far the Task Force had come by changing their culture, structure, and habits to allow the larger corporate command to become as agile and capable as its commandos. Pages 184-188 detail the successful operations that the “Task Force” were able to undertake after the shift. This short example, that covers just 46 minutes of a follow-on-target operation, highlights sharply the outcome of The Task Force’s investment in transparency, trust building and empowered execution. The command took risks and luckily their bosses supported them and let them learn to beat AQI at its own game.\n\nSir Lieutenant General Lamb, a close friend of Stan McChrystal, shared a paper with me once that he titled 'In Command and Out of Control' and it raises a lot of the same questions and concepts about how to lead in a complex and fast-paced world. The conclusions were similar. Success comes from giving freedom to subordinates, increasing speed of action, achieving self-synchronization---in a nutshell: decentralized command. The concept is literally about getting 'out of the control' business and realizing that in order for organizations to take advantage of fleeting opportunities teams must be empowered at the lowest levels to take action. McChrystal echoes this and the need to repeatedly broadcast so that everyone knows the goals and strategy of the organization. This includes letting everyone in the organization have a say about the direction of the ship and feel free to alert others of impending icebergs. McChrystal and Lamb’s cooperation in Iraq was not by accident but from years of trust building and a shared awareness of the big picture.\n\nMissing from the book is a deeper discussion on the role of planning, plans, strategic thinking and strategy. While the Team of Teams approach allows organizations to be adaptable and resilient there is still a key role for planning and strategy. Maybe it’s as simple as the old adage ‘the plan is nothing but planning is everything’ or maybe this is the topic for their next book. Although its demonstrated throughout the book its unstated that great leaders are often well-read. Only by studying leaders and organizations can you begin to see the need for the Nelson touch, to avoid the Perry principle, or understand the butterfly effect.\n\nThe book is only 250 pages long but it is full of simple time-tested ideas that can be put into action with little cost. The difficult part of acting within the shared consciousness that Stan McChrystal describes is getting your people to realize they are empowered to make decisions. This task mostly falls on the senior leaders of an organization. This method can be exhausting and requires resilient and disciplined leadership at all levels, but the rewards are unmatched. I have personally served in organizations that utilize shared consciousness and empowered execution or have previously undergone a Team of Teams evolution. The fact that the culture endures after the leader departs says a lot about how powerful a culture change in an organization can be. I have also served in government agencies that just couldn’t accept that their strength truly lied in informed and empowered employees. Luckily the latter are destined for the dustbin of history.\n\nMore and more often today leaders reinforce an environment that speeds up business failure. The world has changed and leadership models haven't kept up. This book can show you how to adapt to the complex world we find ourselves in. Team of Teams documents how the most professional and deadly special operations force found itself humbled by an enemy that was better adapted to the 21st century way of war. More importantly it’s about how leaders at all levels need to be humble enough to realize when to change their old ways and trust their people to make rapid yet informed decisions.",
    "The book can be summarised in a few points:\n- do a daily meeting with everyone to share information\n- introduce exchange programmes between teams to fight off tribalism\n- take the role of liaison officers seriously\n- delegate authority and focus on culture\n\nSo sometimes the book feels a bit long, especially the long introduction. But these ideas are interesting, told by someone who had to implement it under huge pressure, and the stories that serve as examples are gripping.\n\nRecommended for everyone leading a large organisation and wondering how to to fight against bureaucratic tribalism.",
    "This is an incredibly good book about management, written by a former soldier. It makes the case that management in the knowledge economy needs to operate quite differently if it is to be as effective as good management in the industrial economy.",
    "I’ve read many blog posts and articles about team of teams and was therefore already exposed to its main themes. However reading the book provides much more breadth, content and examples of how the concepts came into being as well as how real world organizations are putting them into practice.\n\nIt will be very helpful as we continue implementing the team of teams framework in our organization.",
    "The difference between complicated and complex, efficient and effective, doing things right or doing the right thing, show the necessary change in perception of challenges and leadership styles required in the 21st century as opposed to the 20th century. This book made me think deeply about what I previously believed was the way to success.",
    "Needing to adapt our management style as technology and the conditions of a global market force new challenges upon us is not a new topic for me. Neither is the notion that we have to embrace these changes and be willing to deploy entirely new approaches to succeed. But to have that all validated by a book about military strategy made this such an interesting read. If they can adapt to the requirements of an agile world, then businesses have no excuse not to.",
    "An outstanding book that describes why traditional military ways of working have to be adapted for todays threat. It crosses over to suggest how these adaptations can be useful in the civil sector."

    "Why You Should Read It: The principles in this book can literally add hours to your days and compound your happiness. It's worth a look. What's more important than having time?\n\nAverage Read Time: 4.5 Minutes\n\nWe've all surely heard of the 80/20 Principle, or Pareto's Law as it's more formally known. It goes something like this:\n\n80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.\nIt's often thrown around in business as nothing more than a buzzword. Few actually do a full 80/20 analysis of their business and almost no one I've come across has applied the same to their life as a whole. Other than two people that is: Richard Kock and Tim Ferriss-and the people who have since followed in their footsteps (me included). The 80/20 Principle is the source material for what Tim wrote in The 4-Hour Work Week. It took me reading it a couple times to grasp the simplicity and life-altering implications of the principle. The time saved and gained will blow your mind.\n\nThe amazing thing is that the studies in this book show the principle working in just about every possible scenario. Of course it's not always 80/20. Sometimes 90/10 or 95/5 or even 70/30. But the point is it works-without fail.\n\nRichard's purpose was to explain this ancient principle in a way that would inspire action and application to every part of life. When applied to work, productivity will go through the roof, but when applied to your life outside of work, happiness and fulfillment do just the same. All it takes is a shift in thinking. Try the following for a few weeks and the time in your life will never be the same.\n\n5 ways to apply the 80/20 Principle to enhance your life:\n\n1. Do the 20% of your work that leads to 80% of your results: Track all the time you spend on projects each hour of each day for a week. How many of these things were necessary? How many got you closer to your goals? How many were a waste of time? How many could someone else have done? Pick the 20% of your tasks that yield 80% of the results and outsource or simply discontinue the rest. Wondering what to do with your remaining time? Enjoy life. I outsourced a significant portion of my work to two very reliable virtual assistants in India starting in 2006. Ravi and Vikash now do that 70 or 80% for me. At $3-5/hour it is very hard to beat. Check out [...] if you're looking to out source. Search \"Virtual Assistant\". Once you start outsourcing, you'll never go back.\n\n2. Locate the 20% of your customers who drive 80% of your profits: Find your top 20% customers (by profit, not revenue) and fire the rest. Yes, fire them. The goal is not to work your life away. It is to make a good living to enjoy your life. If you must work more, then list out the characteristics of your 20% customers and go out and find more of them. You will not believe how liberating it can be to fire a customer who's been a real pain in the ass.\n\n3. Prioritize the 20% of your friends who provide 80% of your support and enjoyment: If you apply 80/20 to your relationships you will surely find that a few people in your life provide the majority of your support, excitement, laughter and feelings of connection. On the other side, there is likely another 20% group of people who account for most your sleepless nights, tears, anger and frustration. If you don't want to feel this way, stop spending time around your bottom 20. Fire them and work on duplicating your top 20. This may sound a little calous, but it's not. It's practical. The quality of our life comes down to the quality of the people and experiences that fill it.\n\n4. Fill your life with the 20% of your experiences that provide 80% of your happiness: As humans, our two biggest priorities are to move towards pleasure and away from pain. As mentioned above, find the few people, things, places and experiences that provide 80% of your happiness, fulfillment, pleasure and excitement. Also find the things that cause you to feel the majority of your negative emotions. Focus your time on the top 20% and avoid the bottom 20% like the plague.\n\n5. Do the 20% of your workouts that lead to 80% of your physical gains: The majority of fitness results come from a small portion of most workouts. 80% of the muscle is built in the last 20% of the reps. Crossfit is a great example. The workouts are 7-14 minutes long on average but they provide more physical benefit than most hour-long workouts. Spending more time on something is not always a good thing. If you believe your workouts must take an hour then you'll likely miss a lot more of them. What if they only took 7 minutes, but that seven minutes really tested your limits? You're likely to show up a lot more often.\n\nI know this sounds simple. But few people stop to actually do it. It is truly possible to spend the majority of your time doing the things that you love. The only way to get there is taking Pareto's 80/20 principle seriously. It will make all the difference.\n\nDo not let more than 3 months go by without performing a full 80/20 breakdown of all areas of your life (especially your personal life). It will only take a couple hours and those hours will likely save days before you know it... 80/20 in action yet again.\n\nSomewhere along the path of life, most of us were taught to associate fulfillment and worth with the number of hours spent-thinking the more the better. This has lead many of us to working aimlessly just to say we filled the day. This IS NOT the goal. The goal is be fulfilled, happy, efficient, effective and more than anything else, to enjoy life. Happiness is a daily right. It is not something we need to work our ass off for years to finally achieve. That is what Pareto stumbled on all these years ago. I encourage you to do the same.",
    "According to the author, you only need to read about 20 percent of this review to get 80 percent of the value! Over 100 years ago, Vilfredo Pareto \"noted the consistently lopsided relationship between inputs and outputs\" and ever since we've called it the 80/20 Principle. This statistical pattern that 20 percent of your effort produces 80 percent of the results is universal.\n\nThis year, Richard Koch wrote a new and updated edition of his 10-year-old business classic, The 80/20 Principle. It's worth reading--or delegating to a team member to read and summarize at a staff meeting. The 80/20 principle is all around us:\n* 20 percent of your donors give 80 percent of the budget\n* 80 percent of your sales come from 20 percent of your customers\n* One-fifth of your time (equivalent to one day a week) produces 80 percent of your important work\n* 80 percent of your people problems come from 20 percent of your staff\n* 20 percent of your volunteers do 80 percent of the work\n* And how about your wardrobe--you likely wear 20 percent of your clothes about 80 percent of the time, right?\n\nIf you care about results (corporate and personal) and you're not leveraging the 80/20 rule, you're wasting a lot of time. For example, read Koch's \"Top-10 Low-Value Uses of Time\" and pick two (20 percent) that tempt you often:\n1) Things other people want you to do\n2) Things that have always been done this way\n3) Things you're not unusually good at doing\n4) Things you don't enjoy doing\n5) Things that are always interrupted\n6) Things few other people are interested in\n7) Things that have already taken twice as long as you originally expected\n8) Things where your collaborators are unreliable or low quality\n9) Things that have a predictable cycle\n10) Answering the telephone\n\nTwo of his \"Top 10 Highest-Value Uses of Time\" include \"things that you can get other people to do for you with relatively little effort on your part,\" and \"things for which it is now or never.\" Can you relate?\n\nKoch includes the science behind the concept and plenty of practical examples, including the top-10 business uses of the 80/20 Principle, such as how to negotiate. He also recommends imposing an impossible deadline to a project so the team will only do the highest value things.\n\nThe book is an excellent companion to the Results Bucket, one of 20 buckets in my book,  Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit . For example, at your next staff meeting discuss these two items: 1) Describe one of your annual goals and how it might reflect the 80/20 Principle; and 2) So now the obvious question is---how do we abandon those things in the 80 percent arena that contribute only 20 percent of our results?",
    "Book Summary in 🤚 points.\nBook #16:\n\nThe 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch\n1. 80/20?\nThe minority, 20% of causes, inputs, or effort usually leads to a majority, 80% of the results.\n\n2. 20% of choices.\nThe ones that have a massive impact.\nEg. You probably can recall a few critical turning points in your life that brought you to your current self.\n\n3. 20% of efforts.\nFind the critical efforts that lead to the majority of results.\nEg. Many ventures often times rely on a few key missions to succeed.\n\n4. Conduct an 80/20 analysis. Find out what you can optimise. To maximise your effectiveness, focus only on what matters most.\n\n5. So, what you can do about it? “Eliminate or reduce the 80% of efforts that produce poor results, there are many ways to waste your time and resources.”\n\nBonus point- 20% of People cause 80% of problems in our lives.\nAnd, 20% of people are the reason for 80% of our happiness.",
    "The Real information is only in 4-5pages other is just Repeatation of same again and again in whole book. No need to buy this book just search on YouTube see one video on this topic.. That's enough",
    "It gives complete applicative analysis about 80/20 principle in business and personal life. The Pareto principle from the mid 20th century applied mainly in business hence it is not new in business but this book tells us how to think and act 80/20 in every aspect of life.\nThe vital few i.e 20% of aspects gives 80% of results. Identify those 20% in business or personal life and increase your allocation of time and effort on those vital few by eliminating less important things.\nIt took me lot of effort to read and understand part one that is entirely of business applications of Pareto law in sales,inventory ,negotiation, focussing on few and right customers.\nWhat I like the most about Richard Koch and this book is after every chapter he tells about upcoming chapter and to skip the chapter based on purpose of your reading.\nIf you are a business person or going to start one then you should read everything but if you doesn't belong, then you should definitely skip part one entirely to save some time and have peace of mind.\nAlthough it has it's drawback\nNot all things or actions or products which are not importantor doesn't add any value can be avoided or eliminated",
    "The main message of the books is that 80 percent of the results are caused by only 20 percent of the causes/efforts. The book is just repeating this idea over and over. I think 100 of what you get from this book is from only 2 percent (~ 5 pages) of the book. The rest is the repetition of the same concept which is poorly paraphrased.",

    "In the midst of an impossible graduate accounting course with a professor I would rather not see ever again, this book saved my GPA. So easy to understand and so many examples that made it easy to learn even for a non-accounting brain. However, this didn’t come with the online practice module for me which was disappointing.",
    "I have been working as an accountant for many years and I like to think I am good at my job. Recently, I have been applying for jobs on Indeed. Turns out they have tests with accounting questions on some job postings. I think I bombed the first couple because 1) just because I do accounting doesn't mean I do every aspect of accounting and 2) the accounting software hides a lot of underlying details and I don't really think about them on a regular basis.\n\nSo I bought this book. I spent a couple evenings skimming the book re-familiarizing myself with accounting vocabulary and such. After just a couple evenings, I aced those tests and started getting interviews.\n\nWill this book teach you accounting if you don't know accounting? I have no idea.\nBut if you already know accounting and it has been many years since you took accounting classes, I absolutely recommend this book to refresh your knowledge.",
    "I had to take accounting two and it had been some time since I had taken accounting so this book was very helpful in helping me get ready for my class.",
    "this would be a good book to give to a 12 year old. maybe they would find it challenging. I've read other \"for dummies\" books and they have been fine. This one though, is literally, \"for dummies\". Reading this feels like an assault to my intelligence, meager as that may be. Flipping through the pages, I can barely stay focused from one paragraph to another due to its simplistic unengaging manner. It is presented in a way reminiscent of how one would use a \"child speaking voice\" to a very small kid, when they explain why they shouldn't do something etc.\n\nAlso, the author constantly references other parts of the book. There will be a paragraph, then at the end it will say along the lines of \"which is in greater detail in book 3, chapter 2\". The author will do this after almost every single paragraph. as if to remind you he is so accomplished as to call one child's book \"9 books\", and wants you to remind you of that constantly.\n\nAll in all, this book will teach you less then the first chapter of an actual college level accounting textbook will teach you. It is a complete waste of money, time, and paper. I gave it 2 stars, only because reading this sad excuse of book made me purchase an actual textbook on accounting.\n\nall in all, if you have a middle school child you'd like to expose to some accounting, maybe their less developed mind would be able to be engaged from this.",
    "As someone trying to manage there own books this was informative in pointing me in the right direction and telling you where to build from there",
    "This book is simply great !!\nIt's worth buying and will never regret my money by any means. It covers all topics regarding accounting. This book exceed my expectations.",
    "I have not finished reading this book yet but so far it goes into even more detail than I need. I was just looking for some basic Accounting information but this book goes far beyond the basics. It has a lot of helpful information and covers so much more than I expected!",
    "I got this hoping to use it as a sort of text book for a home-schooled high school age child. Everyone should have the basics of accounting in hand, after all! But this is way too advanced for him, and even for me as a functioning adult. It presumes a lot of basics with terms and such are already on board. So while it looks very thorough and covers lots of material, it isn't really made to teach you from scratch.",
    "Half of the whole book 7 has messed up graphs and figures. I would expect maybe one-off mistake, but not the entire book 7 to have so many mistakes. It’s like “look at the figure 3-8 about contribution margin”, and the figure 3-8 shows debt amortization instead.\nI assume editors did not do their job properly?",
    "This book is written for a US audience and many of the processes and techniques are wrong for a UK accountant",
    "A bit complicated for our teenage son to read before work experience.. but it definitely covers everything an accountant should know and ideal for anyone running a business.",
    "I did not do so well when I took accounting in school, this book helps me clarify that.",
    "Nice book\nGot it for ₹1419\nBook slightly damaged because of careless packaging."

    "Excelente libro que te hace ver las finas, el dinero sin tapujos. Tener mente millonaria es deber de todos. Lo leeré varias veces.",
    "Un libro que deberíamos tener en la mesita de noche, o en la mesa de la cocina o quizás en el aparador de la entrada. En fin, en cualquier mueble que tenga una pata coja. La única manera de que se hayan podido rellenar 250 páginas con tan pocas \" ideas\" ( por otro lado tan obvias como que mañana saldrá el sol de nuevo ), ha sido por el engrudo que se ha utilizado de relleno. Su extraordinaria redundancia, su repetición hasta la nausea de las ventajas de sus seminarios y de supuestos casos ( todos de éxito of course.. ) de personas que lo han hecho. Todo ello escrito en el más puro estilo american way of live. Si alguien tiene la curiosidad de comprobar si el libro es tan malo como su título, no creo que le defraude. Quien quiera un libro que partiendo de cero, le enseñe las reglas básicas del funcionamiento del dinero y la inversión de una forma realista, tendrá que buscar en la sección de economía. Quien quiera un libro que le enseñe las reglas mágicas para convertirse en millonario, que busque en la sección de cuentos infantiles.",
    "He empezado a leer este libro muy emocionado, basándome en las opiniones de otros usuarios y que cada vez estoy leyendo más sobre el cómo alcanzar el éxito a nivel económico.\n\nTengo que decir que el libro empieza muy bien, recuerdo que tenía la sensación de que este libro iba a marcar un antes y después, pero no ha sido así, es de esos libros que empieza muy bien y en algún momento empieza a perder fuerza él mensajes, creo que en gran parte se debe a que repite durante todo el libro lo importante y bueno que es el seminario que imparte en Estados Unidos.\n\nOtra cosa que no me gusta es que nombra a Donald Trump como un ejemplo a seguir varías veces durante la pieza.\n\nEn resumen, no he terminado el libro. Me ha perdido en algún momento.\n\nRealmente no puedo recomendar su compra.\n\nEspero este review haya sido ÚTIL.",
    "El libro no está del todo mal pero viene a ser una serie de consejos que ya hemos visto en muchos otros sitios como excipiente del tema mollar del que trata el libro: De lo bueno que son los seminarios de este señor y que hay que asistir a uno de ellos para de verdad tener \"una mente millonaria\". Es decir, el libro solo no sirve, es un complemento del seminario que vende este señor. Además cada capítulo viene con una opinión totalmente favorable a los cursos esos por parte de hipotéticos asistentes y de cómo \"cambió\" su mente con respecto al dinero y que ahora nadan en la abundancia.",
    "Si realmente quieres cambiar tu forma de ver lo negocios y hacer de ti un gran empresario y además exitoso, este libro es para ti.\nPero te tienes que dejar guiar y sobre todo poner en práctica todos los consejos que ahí te revelan. Si estás en tu zona de confort y quieres seguir ahí, olvídate del libro, pues este es para que te actives de muchas otras formas.",
    "un excelente libro cada una de las cosas que e leído de este libro no lo sabía y seguramente el 90 % de las personas no lo saben y ni siquiera se lo imaginaran y pues recomendaría al todas las personas que conozco y a las que no conozco también muy muy buen libro ahora a poner en práctica todo lo aprendido"

    "This is a great product! Quality seems good as well. I only wish they would have come on a binder ring. This way I can flip through them and keep them contained at the same time. Or to have come with a metal tin to hold the cards. I don't think the paper box they arrived in will last long at all.",
    "If you think that you're going to buy this deck and it's going to make using DBT skills easy you are wrong. These cards are complex and often in sets of three or four. You cannot just use them like cards. That being said I have found them helpful once I took the time to sit and study them",
    "Diametrically opposed to something? Do you see the world in black and white? Is it hard for you to find gray areas to be able to suppress that highly cynical voice in your own head? Have you had a falling out w/a close friend or a family member— which you regret, but remain committed to your respective beliefs— due to American politics? This deck of cards may be a way back to being kinder, not less than, to one’s self and others while offering us much needed coping skills and alternate modes of reaching our goals w/out the spiraling which can come from an ALL OR NOTHING PARADIGM. There is more than one path to one’s goals. This product helps us to find paths we may not have previously considered as we were locked into a binary (0 or 1) thought pattern about anything— be it trivial or life altering. I am optimistic in a non-hyperbolic manner about the good that can come from honing the skills presented in bite sized bits via this product.",
    "I am a psychiatrist and general DBT fan. I bought these thinking they were coping cards (to carry with you to serve as a reminder of a particular skill you are working on and/or remind you of Linehan's acronyms). They are not. This deck is simply a reproduction of the book in card deck form. It's especially annoying because it had the potential to be a really useful tool by condensing each skill into a single card you could carry with you for practice. They did not do that. Take a skill like DEARMAN - they made 7 cards: one for Describe, one for Express, etc. Like anyone is gonna carry 7 cards around with them for one skill and whip them all out during a meeting 😂 I have to say, the way they made them, the deck format doesn't really make sense because it's not like you can shuffle them and it's not like they're flash cards. That said, it's a decent alternative to purchasing the book, offering the core skills with minimal explanation/redundancy.",
    "I have been using these cards for two and a half years, and they’re one of my most valued resources. They’re never on the bookcase, they’re always on the table where I sit. They are a great way to present and teach skills, and clients enjoy focusing on practicing skills related to what they are going through, or just randomly drawn from the deck. They especially like it when I also draw one to work on for myself, because let’s be honest…talking about skills with clients all day really shines a light on the areas of my life where I could be more effective. This is an excellent stand-alone product, and is very helpful when clients are working with The Expanded Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Manual, which is also by Lane Pederson. I would highly recommend this for any therapist.",
    "I bought both of the DBT decks by Dr. Pederson. The cards themselves are okay. They're easy to read. They are pretty flimsy, so keeping them outside of the box could result in them being damaged fairly easily. So, unless you carry around the whole deck(s), they're not really made to toss in your purse for convenience...which is what I was hoping to do.\n\nHowever, the woman who developed DBT is named Dr. Marsha Linehan. She used her own mental health experiences of living \"in hell\" to create this type of therapy to help others. Since I bought these cards, I have learned that Dr. Pederson has taken this therapy developed by Dr. Linehan, made changes to it so he can market it as his own therapeutic method, and filed a lawsuit against Dr. Linehan to strip her of her trademark on DBT.\n\nDr. Linehan also filed a lawsuit against Dr. Pederson to try to prevent him from marketing his new methods under the name of DBT since he has changed the formula, and she doesn't want people to confuse his potentially harmful, unproven methods with her own that have been proven to work.\n\nI don't know the outcomes of these lawsuits, if they have been resolved as of yet, but Dr. Pederson is obviously still using the title of \"DBT\" to market his method. To me, he sounds like just another poser trying to make it rich off someone else's success...so, I have absolutely no use for these cards now. If I hadn't unwrapped them, I would have sent them back in a heartbeat. But since I have, they will most likely just be going in the trash. Or the fire pit, which might be more fun. Either way, I'll stick to Dr. Linehan's proven DBT method...not the faux DBT put out by Pederson.",
    "helped us a lot.",
    "I was excited to see a DBT deck for therapy use, especially after I've been using the ACT deck and have found it super helpful. However, once I received the cards and began looking through them, I found that most of the information can be easily obtained online or through other materials that I already have. While the ACT cards provided many exercises and thought-provoking questions, the DBT deck basically explains the different components of DBT and occasionally gives an exercise or question.\n\nWhen I made the purchase, I expected an addition to my collection of therapy resources (I've only been collecting for about 2-3 years, so I'm definitely not an expert in the field). Instead, I feel like I spent $20 on notecards that I could've written myself. This isn't very helpful.\n\nI'm not really sure why this product has almost 5 stars... I suppose the cards could be moderately helpful if you know nothing about DBT and don't feel like doing an internet search. But honestly, I'd advise getting a book instead. Or the ACT deck.",
    "Some of these cards are great, others are a little confusing for someone with no professional guidance in DBT. But very well made, colourful. Larger than I expected.",
    "Too much writing to be used as prompt cards",
    "I use dbt cards a lot and thought changing them after a few years would keep interest, but I didn’t really rate them in comparison to my old ones. I’m going to try them a few times see how I get on with them",
    "Just finished my DBT 12 months and wanted to keep with my journey. Someone recommended this as a great way to keep track of those DBT modules/skills.\nOrder was perfectly delivered.",

    "I like the fact that the pages are clearly legible with great grapics. I did not line the fact that the entire book is printed with an inconsistent orientation. The book sees to be printed at an angle that is off horizontal and is also cut at an off horizontal angle. I would return it but I need it for my class but if I had more time I would request a replacement copy.",
    "Book is on good condition but the inside had been sticky noted to death. Isn't a huge deal but prefer to not go through every single page to try and peel off sticky notes that seem to have been in there for the duration of the books life. They're stiff and hard too peel 😑.",

    "I bought this book since my \"Marketing for Managers\" course on my MBA signposts to this book a lot.\n\nWhilst only three chapters in I have to compliment the approach, examples, quality of exposition and regular contemporary examples as exceptional. The presentation is clear and consistent, lots of useful diagrams, colour printed, accessible.\n\nNo wonder this is in its 17th edition.\n\nI can't contrast with alternative texts or whether the content targets what you might require. That said is good enough to not make me wonder about competing titles and is sufficiently comprehensive for a thorough perspective of marketing at the target level of depth.",
    "Having owned every edition of this classic text (and now in retirement from some 50 years of practicing industrial marketing) I can un-reservedly recommend Professor Kotler's book. The clarity and logic of his approach to the fundamental task of all/any business is un-paralleled.

    "A great resource in my classroom! Very helpful!",
    "I got this book to help me teach my 12 year old with special learning needs. I love how this book is organized. I had a bunch of curriculum to work with, but there was no order to any of it. This book gave me the framework that I needed. Another great thing about the book is that the pages are thick and I can use a highlighter without it bleeding through to the other side. The only thing that I would change would be the workbook aspect. I wish that these parts were a little bigger and maybe on a separate page. However, the main reason I got the book was for the organization and the text aspect. Overall I would recommend this book, especially to homeschool families. However, you will definitely need to supplement with more practice work.",
    "I was looking for a good grammar book to use with my homeschooled child and to freshen up some points in my own mind. While this one was recommend on several sights, I'm not the biggest fan.\nThe information is well organized, explained, and there are exercises offered to practice it. It's not trouble to look things up and gain a good understanding of each grammar rule as long as you already have a pretty good handle on things, in general.\nI was really not impressed with the self-test in the beginning. While the terms of various grammar points are good to know, there was a huge emphasis on this, which for me, as someone who edits quite often, isn't exactly practical or helpful.\nAlso, I had hoped for more exercises to work on the various points, especially for my homeschooled child. Depending on the grammar point, there are more or less of these. But this is not what this book is intended for completely. At least, not done in a way which works well for my 9th grader, since it's a bit dry, extremely crowded (the printed pages do not include any real division between explanation and exercises, which causes a visual overload for anyone learning) Plus, there isn't any extra space for answers. It's just too tight for teaching purposes. Also, the answer key is at the back of the book (not really a problem), but this requires tons of flipping and searching. So, for homeschooling purposes, not ideal.\nIn any case, this is book holds a wealth on grammar information and fulfills its general purpose well, but it wasn't what I was looking for.",
    "Had trouble with English grammar my whole life and this book has been helping me get my Grammar straight. Love doing the problems as I go along. Can't say enough about this book.",
    "Bought to use with boyfriend so we could learn more about grammer. Could have been more engaging. We stopped using after one session.",
    "I normally don't write reviews about anything but this book genuinely deserved one. I was never great at grammar but I always wanted to improve my grasp of the English language grammatically. I never could do that though because most grammar books that were provided by my school were either boring or overly complicated. However, this book literally is the best grammar book I have ever had the pleasure to open. It's engaging and I feel like I am learning. Honestly, I look forward to opening it again because the author really make this book in such a way that makes me feel like I can truly graso grammar. I am happy with my purchase and the title of this book really speaks for itself.",
    "I bought this to freshen up on my grammar. I write extensively for work and needed a refresher. Keeps my mind!",
    "For the last few months, I've taken one little section of Grammar lessons and tests and am plugging along. If I'd only gotten as far as I have (1/3) I would've gotten my money's worth. I've always had difficulties with grammar and Arlene Miller's approach is stellar. The level of confidence she imparts is brilliant. Taken in bite-sized nibbles, this is a writerly and editorly game changer.",

    "This was a re-read. I first read it when it was originally published and enjoyed it. I am in a different line of work now and upon reading it again, found much inspiration and motivation within.",
    "This book took me from being some what shy or ashamed of the mistakes in my process to being proud and reliant on it being known. Also with the brilliant revelation that it's part of the story people care about the most in most cases. Thank you for this work of art.\n\nSincerely,\nWilliam Shelton",
    "I enjoyed reading this book, especially in digital form. It gave me the answers I needed for myself as both author and writer of stories I want to share with the world.\n\nThank you, Mr. Kleon for writing both Steal Like An Artist and Show Your Work. I bought the third book Keep Going and I plan to read that as soon as possible.",
    "As Austin Kleon explains, his previous book, Steal Like an Artist, \"was about stealing influence from other people\" whereas \"this book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from [begin italics] you [end italics].\" I agree with him that \"all you have to do is to show your work\" but only if (HUGE \"if\") it's worth stealing and you know how to do that in terms of what, when, and where. Actually, he wrote this book \"for people who hate the very idea of self-promotion.\" It's not enough to be very good. \"In order to be found, you have to [begin italics] be findable [end italics]. I think there's an easy way of putting your work out there and making it discoverable [begin italics] while [end italics] you're focused on getting really good at what you do.\"\n\nKleon's two books can be of incalculable value to those who need help with creating content (whatever its nature and extent may be) and then help with attracting the interest and support of those on whom the success of the offering depends. It could be a product, a service, or both. Its target market could be singles, seniors, the unemployed or under-employed, new parents, do-it-yourselfers, beginners at whatever...you get the idea.\n\nSo, how to become findable? First, Kleon explains the need for developing a new mindset, one that will enable the reluctant self-promoter to think differently so that she or he can then operate differently. Here's his key point: \"Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built [begin italics] sharing [end italics] into their routine. Next, he urges his reader to find what the musician Brian Eno characterizes as a \"scenius\": a group of creative individuals who make up an ecology of talent. \"What I love about the idea of scenius is that it makes room in the story of creativity for the rest of us: the people who don't consider ourselves geniuses.\"\n\nThen Kleon suggests ten specific observations and initiatives, devoting a separate chapter to each. The purpose of the first, \"You don't have to be a genius,\" is an important reassurance that David and Tom Kelley also provide in their recently published book, Creative Confidence: Believing that only geniuses are creative \"is a myth that far too many people share. This book is about the opposite of that myth. It is about what we call 'creative confidence.' And at its foundation is the belief that we are [begin italics] all [end italics] creative...Creative confidence is a way of seeing that potential and your place in the world more clearly, unclouded by anxiety and doubt. We hope you'll join us on our quest to embrace creative confidence in our lives. Together, we can all make the world a better place.\"\n\nThe other nine call for initiatives that almost anyone can take. Kleon suggests the most important do's and don'ts to keep in mind. Two key elements are repeatedly emphasized. First, share generously and continuously with those who comprise an appropriate (key word) ecology of talent: people who share common interest and goals, yes, but also common questions and concerns. Share what will be of greatest interest and value to them. Also, be yourself. Why? I like Oscar Wilde's response best: \"Everyone else is taken.\" Each person is a unique work-in-progress. That's hardly an original insight but well-worth repeating.\n\nLet's allow Austin Kleon the final observations: \"Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. Audiences today not only want to stumble across great work, they, too, long to be part of the creative process. By showing people your 'behind-the-scenes footage\" [i.e. portions of incomplete and imperfect work], they can see the person behind the products, and they can better form a relationship with you and your work.\" So show it...and your authentic self in process.",
    "A good quick read, learned a lot about myself.",
    "This book change mi life. Know I Show my work on the internet and everything is different.",
    "Loved the concise, focused principles on building an audience through sharing your thoughts and creations. I’d recommend this to anyone who’s felt the urge to build a presence (online or otherwise) and the fear that comes from doing so. Thanks Austin!",
    "I love his little if box thinking and doing what he says! Fella creator💖😇😇😇",
    "This book was published in 2014, and it shows. 7 years on, the advice is a little simplistic given social networks now control what we see so much more, with algorithms brutally deciding what content you should and shouldn’t see, and the expectation that you’ll post a dozen disposable IG stories, TikToks and YouTube shorts every day.\n\nIt’s still useful, but needs to be peppered with modern advice; Make art and share it when you have something you want to share. Don’t burn yourself out being a social media god every single day.",
    "This is the very first book that I’ve read that focuses on teaching you different hacks in life. I usually read fantasy and fiction, but from YouTubers, I managed to stumble across books such as this which have influenced them. Because of them, I’ve decided to try them out myself. While being short, everything written on it has taught me something new, and I probably took longer than others to read it because I wrote notes on every passage on my Mac. Thank you once again for this excellent guide.",
    "I’m in a different line of work, but some really good tips here about being generous with your process - being willing to say where you are and what you’re doing might not mean much to you, but it is a gift to others",
    "This book is brilliant. It takes a lot to keep my attention but this book did it. It had a LOT of pictures (so perhaps there isn’t as much content as you might initially believe when first looking at it) but it’s great for encouragement in DOING.",
    "If you’re a procrastinating creative person, you’re going to love this book. I’m totally motivated to start sharing my thoughts and work that is or isn’t complete from now on.\n\nI like the idea that it’ll sometimes give me a kick up the backside or tell me to put the project on hold.\n\nI’m going to recommend this to anyone who has a creative bone in their body.\n\nI am looking forward to reading the other two books I picked up with this one.\n\nI chose to give it a five star rating because it definitely delivered on what I was expecting from beginning to the end. I will certainly be dipping into it again."

My only issue is with the digital version that I got (because it's half as much as the physical copy). I have bought textbooks for my Kindle and this is the first one that is formatted like this.\nTo be able to read it easily, I have to switch into landscape mode and zoom in a lot. There is no option to reformat that I can find.\nSo, again, great book, a lot of great information, the digital version is just rough to read.",

    "An excellent book for those beginning to explore assessment in special needs education, and also for those who have been studying assessment or special education for some time and would appreciate a comprehensive, accessible and current (assuming you use the most recent edition) overview of the area. Systematic, and wide-ranging, the authors assume no prior knowledge of assessment and provide consistently clear explanations, and illuminating examples - as well as a useful summary of assessment standards across various (mostly US) professional bodies. I would have liked recommendations for further reading that went beyond the standard reference list.\nOne caveat - the spine of the book was damaged and needed home- repair to prevent pages dropping out. I do not know if this was a result of transit or poor manufacturing. I incline towards the latter as the paper used is very light weight- the pages are flimsy (The book is also expensive).",

    "I just passed the CISSP and found that this book did the most in preparing me. Everyone is different with various backgrounds so I cannot speak to what others say, but in terms of speaking from my experience I would say this book moderately prepared me for the test. I read every chapter and did all of the exercises at the end of each chapter. I also used the official practice tests book and activated the online Wiley questions from that book. In addition, I read the Syngress book \"11th Hour CISSP 3rd edition\", though it is getting out of date, hopefully they update it because it is a really solid reference book. I took notes, writing stuff down helps. Studied for 5 months and did no cramming. If I can pass it, then I know you guys/gals can pass it. Just do the work and do the time. The reason I typed all of this was because the most open reviews really helped me in purchasing the write materials to help me pass along with coworkers who also passed.",
    "A thorough and well set out guide that is a must for anyone studying for the CISSP certification. An excellent companion to the LinkedIn Learning cert prep course.",
    "I purchased the book along with the CBK in order to prep for the exam, It took about a month and half to read the book cover to cover and retain as much information as needed for each domain followed by a month of review and periodic practice test and successfully passed the exam. It provides very insightful and easy to follow narrative covering all areas and helped me better grasp concepts that I struggled with or was unfamiliar with prior to starting my exam prep. The knowledge checks at the end of each chapter helped me accurately gauge my proficiency topics and domains and where to focus my study efforts.\n\nThe two major reasons that I gave this book a 4/5 rather than a 5/5 were because of the amount of misprint/typo's in the knowledge checks, not sure if this is the fault of the publisher or the QA process but a fair number of questions had the wrong answer marked as correct or the right answer was not an option at all.\nThe other reason is that this book does not cover all terminology introduced with the latest iteration of the CISSP exam, the first example that comes to mind is the book lacks any reference to the term \"Data Steward\", this term pops up in other practice exams and specifically for me I saw it during the actual exam but there is no mention of it in this edition of the book.\n\nI would recommend this book as an essential tool to anyone who is looking to pass the CISSP exam!",
    "I didn’t read it cover to cover but instead used it to fill in the gaps and it was fine for that. It’s 1200 pages so it is a lot to take in but is very good. I found this will certainly help in passing the exam but can be overwhelming. My advice is to find your weak areas using the exam objectives and practice questions then spend time in the book that covers it. The adaptive nature of the exam will find your weaknesses.",
    "Dozens upon dozens of prep material for CISSP, but the Official Study Guide is the only essential reading. Domains are adequately covered. All practice questions are well written and well explained. You can't go wrong picking this up for your preparation.",
    "I highly endorse this system and recommend that you buy the combo study guide/test book set, access the online test site, and follow Mike's recommendations.\n\nRead the material, take the tests in the books, take the online tests and keep taking them.\n\nThe amount of information covers many subjects, but if you follow Mike's recommendations you'll be ready. How long your preparation takes depends on your previous and current exposure to the subjects covered but you will get it if you stick to it.\n\nAgain, get the books, take the time to prepare, test, test, test and you will be ready.\n\nGood luck!",
    "I liked the ways how the topics are displayed and explained ; also the amount of the 1 inch deep and 1 mile wide in this book made it stand alone source of knowledge.\n\nwhat really add to my study plan are the e materials:\n\n-Searchable Glossary gives you instant access to the key terms you'll need to know for the exam.\n-Audio lessons: 2 hours and 50 minutes of new audio review for CISSP, featuring author Mike Chapple reading the Exam Essentials for each chapter.\n-1020 flash card\n-960 exam question with 2 modes (study and exam ) with random and sequential orders\n\neven if you are not planning to be certified this book will provide you with huge amount of knowledge to understand the Information Security world.",
    "I used just this book, the accompanying practice tests book and Mike's weekly preparation schedule to study for my exam. I took the exam on 01/18/2022 and passed on first attempt. This book along with my industry experience in networks, security and storage helped me tremendously. This book covered topics that were new to me such as various security models, encryption ciphers and modes and Capability Maturity Models, DR/BCP...etc. I also got exposed to many frameworks (Risk, Cyber security, COBIT) as well as standards such as ISO 27001/2, NIST SP 800 53A/B and many others. I used this book primarily to understand and enhance my knowledge, but it helped me with my CISSP exam. All the best.",
    "I think because it's the OSG they may have got lazy and threw a load of dry content in with no attempt to make it easy for the student. The content doesn't seem structured in that the chapters are a mix of domains and content repeats in various chapters albeit with less or greater detail but it's a bit scrambled.\n\nKindle edition is awful, they couldn't be bothered to expand the TOC. into the same format as the actual book.",
    "Mike presents well. A good structure to follow, and I found great value for money for a self-paced study guide for preparing for the CISSP exam. The practice tests I found invaluable in continually testing what I was studying as I was going along.\n\nGood content. Thorough. Comprehensive. Good Value. Accurate. Up-to-date.",
    "Great product, value for money Thank You",
    "I don’t use pirated/xerox copies/pdfs. So waited and bought this 9th edition (even after passing CISSP last year). But it’sa mixed feeling that only a minimum changes are made, few but important topics are added.\n\nBut if you are starting after the new syllabus yes then go for it.",

    "“Givers”, “Takers”, and “Matchers” are three fundamental styles of interacting with others. “Takers” use other people solely for their own gain. “Givers” focus on acting in the interests of others, even when the benefits to others exceed the cost to themselves. “Matchers” operate on the principle of fairness by seeking reciprocity.\nWhich one best describes you in business?\nOf course, in marriage and friendships, we contribute whenever we can without keeping score. We also shift from one style of behaviour to another, across different work roles and relationships. However, we all have a primary style and it has been shown to play as much of a role in our work success as hard work, talent, and luck.\nWhich style of relating is most likely to end up at the bottom of the success ladder, and which style on top? Pause here for a moment and reflect on your personal experience.\nResearch demonstrates that givers sink to the bottom of the success ladder - they make others better off, but sacrifice their own success. In a study of more than 160 engineers in California the least successful engineers were those who gave more than they received. A study of more than 600 medical students in Belgium, showed the lowest grades going to those described as givers. Salespeople were no different, with givers generating 2 ½ times less in annual sales.\n“On average, givers earn 14% less money, have twice the risk of becoming victims of crimes, and are judged as 22 % less powerful and dominant,” reports author Professor Adam Grant, the youngest full professor of the Wharton School of Business.\nIf the givers are at the bottom of the success ladder, who then is at the top—takers or matchers?\nThe data reveals a surprising pattern – the givers again! “This pattern holds up across the board,” Grant reports. “The top performers were givers, and they averaged 50 percent more annual revenue than the takers and matchers.” It was only at the start of medical school that givers underperformed. They increased their scores each year and by the sixth year, the givers earned substantially higher grades than their peers. When the givers became doctors, they climbed still further ahead. And this pattern holds true across occupations.\nDavid Hornik, a venture capitalist, is admired for his commitment to acting in the best interests of entrepreneurs. When he gives an entrepreneur a term sheet - a bullet-point document outlining the material terms and conditions of a business agreement - he also suggests that they shop around to ensure they get the best deal for themselves. Other investors, and if it is a promising deal there are always others, give entrepreneurs a tight deadline to respond to their offer in order to prevent shopping around.\nThe best venture capitalists have an acceptance rate of nearly 50% of the term sheets they offer. In the 11 years as a venture capitalist, Hornik has offered 28 term sheets and twenty-five have accepted.\n“In this book, I want to persuade you that we underestimate the success of givers like David Hornik,” Grant asserts.\nGiving can be more powerful and less dangerous than most would believe. “Givers reverse the popular plan of succeeding first and giving back later, raising the possibility that those who give first are often best positioned for success later,” Adam explains. The venture capitalist Randy Komisar remarks, “It’s easier to win if everybody wants you to win… (If) you don’t make enemies out there, it’s easier to succeed.”\nSuccess is less about raw talent or aptitude, and more about the strategies givers use. Givers are not necessarily nice, and they’re not necessarily altruistic.\nIn a purely win-lose interaction, giving rarely pays. Most of life is not win-lose. People who choose giving as their primary reciprocity style end up reaping rewards. One reason why givers take time to succeed, is that it takes time for givers to build goodwill and trust, and establish reputations and relationships that enhance their success.\n“Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a marathon,” says Chip Conley, founder of Joie de Vivre Hotels. Today, speed is making the long-run shorter, and technology is amplifying the advantages of being a giver. In the past, most people worked in independent jobs that rarely required collaboration, so it was fairly inefficient to be a giver. Today, more than 80 percent of Americans work in service jobs where giving is not a choice, but a business necessity.\nSteve Jones, the former CEO of one of the largest banks in Australia, commissioned a study of successful financial advisers. It was not financial expertise or effort that made for success, it “was whether a financial adviser had the client’s best interests at heart, above the company’s and even his own.”\nAll this needs to be calibrated by observation, that too many givers become pushovers and doormats, and fail to advance their own interests. What differentiates successful givers from failed givers is the degree to which the givers expressed two key motivations: self-interest and other-interest. Self-interest involves pursuing power and achievement, and other-interest focuses on being generous and helpful.\nThis is well illustrated by a study of “Caring Canadian” award winners. The award is made by the Governor General of Canada to honour volunteers. In their life stories, these highly successful givers mentioned a quest for power and achievement almost twice as often as the comparison group. They also had roughly 20% more objectives related to gaining influence, earning recognition, and attaining individual excellence.\nTakers score high in self-interest and low in other-interest and selfless givers score high on other-interest and low on self-interest. Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs.\n“If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are “otherish”: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests,” Grant concludes.\nMuch food for thought.\n\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High --+--Low\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy and is the author of\nStrategy that Works",
    "While I am dubious about some of the claims made here (some of the studies used to support them appear not to have replicated), I believe that the author’s message that being a giver is a successful strategy is a good one. And the resources at the end of the book are very useful.",
    "Although 2013 is still young, I predict that Give and Take, by Wharton professor Adam Grant, has a great chance of being the best book I've read all year, for three reasons: it's inspirational, it's instructional, and it's solidly research-based.\n\nThe premise of the book is quite simple: the world comprises three types of people: givers, takers and matchers. Which type tends to be most successful? Although we've all been raised on the homily that it's better to give than to receive, the bad news is that the left side of most bell curves is populated by givers, those who contribute more to others than they expect in return. Quite simply, they do less for themselves, people take advantage of them, and they are prone to burnout.\n\nBut the real surprise is that the right side of bell curves is also a givers' neighborhood. Combining extensive research with inspiring examples, Grant shows us how and why successful givers do well for themselves at the same time that they contribute so much to others. Successful givers approach four principal aspects of relationships differently. The four aspects are networking, collaborating, developing talent and communicating.\n\nSuccessful givers are excellent networkers, but so are a lot of takers and matchers. The difference is that successful givers proactively do things without expectation of return, creating goodwill and possibly setting an example that may be contagious. One of the excellent tips in this chapter is the suggestion to revive dormant connections. The benefit is that when most people tap into their network for help, their strong ties are trusting and disposed to help, but their weak ties have more diverse information. People you haven't talked to in a long time combine the assets of strong ties and weak ties.\n\nGivers are also excellent collaborators, quick to help others in a team environment and without spending too much time worrying about who gets credit. They tend to demonstrate what the National Outdoor Leadership School calls expedition behavior, putting the needs of the mission and the team ahead of your own. In the long run, this behavior increases their prestige and the willingness of others to help them when they need it.\n\nGivers are also excellent at spotting talent, because they're not worried about creating rivals who may outshine them. Also, because they tend to assume competence and talent on the part of others, they may be generating self-fulfilling prophecies. I found this chapter to be rather long on anecdote and thin on evidence, but the next chapter made up for it.\n\nFor me the meatiest chapter covered the successful practices that givers follow in communicating with others, in presenting, selling, and negotiating. Successful givers ask more meaningful questions and have an effective mix of confidence and humility in their advocacy. They also tend to be good at perspective-taking, which is the cognitive equivalent of empathy: instead of feeling what the other person is feeling, they are adept at thinking what they're thinking. In studies, people with high empathy do worse in creating value, because they are more apt to give the other person what they want. Those high in perspective taking are better at coming up with creative ideas to give both sides more of what they want.\n\nThe second section of the book is for those who are too giving, and tend to fall at the bottom of the success distribution because they get taken advantage of and exhaust their energies serving others rather than themselves. The key insight is that self-interest and other-interest are not opposite points on a single line; they are separate axes on a graph. Those who give too much have a high score for other-interest, and a low score for self-interest. Successful givers are at the top right of the graph, combining a high other-focus with high self-interest. As a result, they are in better control of their giving, seeing it as a positive choice rather than an obligation, and being more proactive in allocating their giving time and energy.\n\nIf you get inspired by Grant's book, what you'll really want to know is how to become a more successful giver. The Catch-22 is that giving has to be sincere it it's to work, and if you try to make it strategic it's not sincere. I do think, however, that if you begin changing your behavior for strategic purposes, and start doing more for others, two positive things may happen. First, regardless of the motive, you're contributing to the sum total of benefit and happiness. Even more important is that your attitude may begin to catch up with your actions. The mind does not like cognitive dissonance, so if we're acting in a giving manner we will begin to see ourselves more as givers, leading to a virtuous circle. The book finishes with ten suggestions for becoming more of a giver--I'll keep you posted on how it works.\n\nThe one weakness in the book is that in some of the chapters, as mentioned above, there was less evidence than it seemed on first reading. You get pulled in to the inspiring stories, but on closer reading you don't find enough evidence to be able to make up your mind whether those examples are the rule or the exception.\n\nDespite this, the message in Grant's book is so powerful that I give it five stars. But it's not a gift--it's truly earned. The book itself is a gift to anyone who reads it, and to countless others who may be on the receiving end of their stepped-up giving.\n\nDisclaimer: I may be subject to some confirmation bias, because although I don't know Adam Grant personally, I found out about the book through the very complimentary article profiling him in the New York Times Magazine. (Of course, that's one way highly successful givers work their magic..)",
    "I would never usually read books on this topic, but “Give and Take” by Adam Grant was chosen as the non-fiction book of the month for the Women’s Literary Collective so I thought I’d give it a try.\n\nGrant’s idea is that, at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Takers want to get as much possible out of another person, matchers want to give and take in equal measure and givers don’t expect anything for their contribution. If you’re interested, you can take a quick quiz online to see which category you fall into: Give and Take Quiz\n\n“As Samuel Johnson purportedly wrote, “The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.”\n\nTo explain these concepts, Grant uses a series of very detailed examples. As the majority of these examples are North American, I found the majority of them really hard to relate to. I’m not into American politics or sports and I don’t have a great interest in American business culture either (I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a full episode of The Simpsons!). I feel that the examples were much longer and much more detailed that necessary and that meant that by the time I got to the actual point, I wasn’t that interested. Something that we discussed at the book club was that, as well as being American, the majority of these examples are from privileged white heterosexual males. This book could have been a great opportunity to explore a whole range of examples and backgrounds, so it’s a disappointment that Grant chose not to.\n\nWhen I reached the end of the book, there was a section which listed ‘Actions for Impact’, things you can do to apply the principles of the book to your life and work. Looking through the list, I noticed that my workplace already has the vast majority of these things in place, and I wonder if this could be partly why I couldn’t connect with the book so much. I’m thinking that perhaps I am already accustomed to some of these ways of working in my day to day life and therefore couldn’t find a way to connect.\n\nI think the ideas in this book are good and it’s interesting to know that givers are ultimately more successful than takers, but I did find the book overall to be quite tedious and I probably wouldn’t recommend it for this reason. I can’t help but feel that the content of this book would have been better digested in a shorter format, such as an article or podcast.\n\nOverall rating: Whilst I don’t think it’s revolutionary, I found the topic of “Give and Take” to be quite interesting and it sparked some really great discussion. The overall style wasn’t to my tastes though and I’d have preferred not to have had the lengthy, detailed examples that dragged this book out for me. I wouldn’t recommend it as a book, but won’t be ruling out the work of Adam Grant going forward, because I think the message is good, it’s the format that didn’t quite work – 2 stars for the book.",
    "Adam Grant divides workers into givers, takers and matchers - and his research suggests that givers are in some cases the most effective workers and in other cases the least effective.\n\nThe book is full of stories of successful givers and tips on how to become a successful giver: look to sort out other people's problems and it will pay off (sometimes serendipitously), you will be better at HR decisions (you're not so determined to be right; you want what's best for other people and the organisation), you can be good at influencing (don't do this through a power play but through modesty - stammering can be helpful), and you can keep from burn-out through making sure you see the direct results of your giving and through 'chunking' it so it happens in big bursts and not through a drip feed of good actions. As to why some givers end up at the bottom of the heap, that's because they are 'selfless' rather than 'otherish' givers - that's to say, they don't set any boundaries and aren't good at asking for help for themselves. It's amazing just what people will do to help you - or others - if you ask them. And they'll be likely to go on helping once they start...\n\nSo far so good - and I certainly enjoyed reading this - it's persuasive and surprising.\n\nIf I felt less than 100% convinced, though, that's partly because Grant has so little to say about 'takers' (and yet he acknowledges they sometimes make the world go round - Michael Jordan is one example he quotes) - and on this, there are other books (Maccoby's book on narcissistic leaders, which points to the highs and lows of the taker in working life). It's also because he doesn't really go into what makes people 'takers' or 'givers' in the first place - is it a given or does it depend on what you learn in your family as you grow up about 'how we behave round here and what gets us what we want in this environment'?...Perhaps there will be a sequel..",
    "I tend to be extra cautious before buying books with many endorsements from other \"best-selling\" authors. One can never tell whether these \"endorsements\" are genuine, and if I feel I am being manipulated, I won't buy. However, I can't begin to comprehend the amount of work that went into this book—thoroughly researched with plenty of real-world examples that you can modify to solve problems. Adam Grant is a good storyteller, and I recommend you read this book.",
    "Adam Grant is a brilliant organisational psychologist and a thrilling writer. If you enjoy reading books that are based on scientific evidence, whose content actually applies to your life and are written in an easy to understand yet highly compelling way, this is for you. A page-turner that will help you better understand how you relate to others and what you can do to be more successful. One of my favourite books of all time.",
    "If I never hear the name Adam Rifkin again I think it'll be too soon, or the words giver and taker. Basically some words/people were over used. But overall I really enjoyed this book and felt like I got a lot out of it. It did make me feel guilty though as I'm pretty sure I'm a matcher and he left no real scope for them and didn't really explain much about them. It had nice themes of history, psychology and kindness- overall I would recommend this book"

    "Gives great insight on how good/great management is done. Raises awareness how idiosyncrasies of employees matters. As based on the analysis of 1,5 mln. of hours of interviews with 80 k managers it's hardly can be bad right? For those who cannot afford a week or so to bring the book the the knees I will list below some of the ideas I remember or had jotted down.\n\n1. People don’t quit their companies, they quit their bosses;\n2. Define the right outcomes and then let each person find his own route toward those outcomes;\n3. The most efficient route that nature has found from point A to point B is rarely a straight line. It is always the path of least resistance;\n4. All roles demand some accuracy & safety, standardized steps are needed (Baring Bank case);\n5. Languages, symbols, conventions, scales-these are the DNA of civilization-without the ability to accept standards we could have never developed such a complex society;\n6. The companies that define the new standards will gain huge advantage over latecomers;\n7. Customers’ levels of expectations\na. Accuracy\nb. Availability\nc. Partnership;\nd. Advice/educate\n8. Customer is ultimate judge of value;\n9. Use practical ways to see world through your customers eyes;\n10. At Disney they think vibrant companies should have 5 year plans but willing to change it every year - that’s tough for the intermediaries like managers;\n11. When I draw my playbook I always go from the players to the plays-head coach of Minnesota Vikings;\n12. Focus on each persons strengths and manage around his weaknesses. Don’t try to fix the weaknesses… help each person to become more of who he already is;\n13. One of the sings of the great manager is the ability to describe in detail the unique talent of each of his people – what drives each one, how each one thinks, how each build relationships;\n14. Know the difference between the skills and knowledge and weaknesses;\n15. The golden rule is broken by the great managers every day-they don’t treat people the way they would lie to be treated-people don’t breath same psychological oxygen;\n16. Time you spent with your best employee (not the weakest) is your most productive time;\n17. No news is never good news;\n18. From the perspective of great managers averaging is irrelevant to excellence-top performers have more potential for growth;\n19. Success is achieved through a never-ending pursuit of improvement-personally, professionally financially and spiritually;\n20. Each of us is a couple of talent cards short of a full deck;\n21. Partnerships are not archetype, each partnership in fact is anomaly;\n22. If you find yourself spending most of your time managing weakness of particular employee, than know that you’ve made a casting error;\n23. When employee requires growth-promotion-help each person find roles that ask him to do more and more of what he is naturally wired to do;\n24. Most employees are promoted to the level of their incompetence;\n25. Great managers envision company where there are multiple routes towards respect and prestige;\n26. Broadbanding – for each role you define a pay in broad bands or ranges with the top end of the lower level role overlapping the bottom end of the role above-companies like Merill Lynch & Disney have well endured the practice;\n27. During the Gallup’s interviews with great managers they found a consistent willingness to hire employees who the manager knew, might soon earn significantly more than they did;\n28. Create heroes in every role;\n29. Great managers make sure to have 4 hours a year with an employee to discuss their career path;\n30. When using trial periods for employees you must be very clear about the details;\n31. What level of performance is unacceptable? Any level that hovers around average with no trend upward;\n32. In mind of great managers to care means to set the person up for success;\n33. G.M. on “tough love”- each of best men on my two weddings was someone I fired;\n34. G.M. : but I know my people some times better then they know themselves;\n35. The four keys to great management are:\na. Select for talent;\nb. Define the right outcomes\nc. Focus on strengths;\nd. Find the right fit;\n36. When casting for talent ask open-ended questions;\n37. Past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior. Therefore questions like “tell me about a time when you…” can serve you well;\n38. Pitfall is evaluating articulation and memory of interviewed;\n39. Rapid learning is an important clue to persons talent. Ask candidate what kind of roles she has been able to learn quickly. Ask her what activities come easily to her now..\n40. Great managers find times for performance management routines-4 common characteristics for it:\na. Routine is simple;\nb. Routine forces frequent interaction between manager and employee;\nc. Routine is focused on the future\nd. Makes employee to keep track of his own performance\n41. In the world according to great managers the employee is the star. The manager is the agent.\n42. When you enter your place of work, you never leave it at zero. You either make it a little better or a little worse.\n43. Managers trump companies;\n44. Human power lies in its idiosyncrasy;\n45. Real profit increase drives stock increase-sustainable growth drives real profit increase-loyal customers drive customer growth-engaged employees drive customer loyalty-the right people in the right roles wit the right managers drive employee engagement;\n46. Great managers are not looking for people who are easy to manage;\n\nDon't judge me for posting this tonight I'm glory glory guy not forza or vamps :) :UCLfinal:",
    "\"This book, based on twenty years empirical data, you have to love that. After first reading this book in 2006, my reaction was \"MAN! This is a validation of what my mentors showed me\". I have had some GREAT mentors during my career, both in the military and later, as a civilian. They taught me how to see things outside of conventional wisdom (not merely ignore that wisdom). If I may now offer further review: The following will comprise of my impressions of the Conventional vs. Revolutionary Key Approaches, offered on pages 66 and 67 offered in FIRST BREAK ALL THE RULES (1999) by M. Buckingham and C. Coffman.\n\nConventional Key: \"Select a person based on his experience, intelligence, and determination\". There is nothing wrong with this statement in of itself. Let's say that there is are two candidates, one external, and one internal for one Engineering Change Order Coordinator position and the enterprise software system being used is Oracle. The external candidate does not have experience with the specified software, however has written thousands of ECOs, as well as cause and effect reports for their department. The other candidate has experience with exact software, however only minimal similar report writing. If the manager chooses the internal candidate due to the software experience, it may work fine in the long run. It can prove to be a better selection tool for the manager to use the Revolutionary Key: \"When selecting someone, they select for talent, not simply experience, intelligence, and determination\". In this case, the external candidate has a proven talent for working with personnel from multiple departments, in order to complete tasks that come with ECO writing. This individual will may likely have skill sets can perhaps cross over with minimal system training.\n\nConventional Key: \"Set expectations by defining the right steps\". Creating flowcharts to show the steps needed to complete a set of tasks is a good thing. Using the Revolutionary Key: \"When setting expectations, they define the right outcomes, not the right steps\", can prove better. Perhaps you still use Visio, but instead you reverse engineer the processes to find your prerequisites. Work the process backward, from your desired outcome, back to the start.\n\nConventional Key: \"Motivate the person by helping him identify and overcome weaknesses\". This less politically correct method of evaluating an employee, still fits well for some of the workers that reported to me. Their request was for me to \"Tell me what I am doing wrong, so I can fix it.\" Revolutionary Key: \"When motivating someone, they focus on strengths not weaknesses\". For the most part, this approach has been the norm for myself, and the people that worked for me. The reviews that I wrote were geared more towards professional development in fact. I will not manufacture a weakness in someone, when one is not present! With influence from a previous manager, I began to have group study with the shop, install, and service foremen. Instead of having them read a book, we each studied a chapter a week. Each week, a different person would be assigned the chapter, and would write, and hand out a worksheet with a set of questions a couple days before we met, and then the team would discuss the assignment.\n\nConventional Key: \"Develop the person by helping them learn and get promoted. Career path by default? There is a certain quaintness to the \"paid your dues\"Âpath. So, if the worker is one of the best, AND shows leadership potential, I would still recommend this process Revolutionary Key: When developing someone, they help him find the right fit not simply the next rung on the ladder. Truly a key point. Even if it is the \"paid your dues path, finding there right fit, and then developing that individual to be able to handle the new level of responsibility.\n\nTalent: \"A recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\" Three recurring patterns that I feel a supervisor should have, are Ethics, Responsibility, And Command. A fairly cut and dry selection for me, as my most important mentors in the military and in business, all have had these talents\n\nFrom the Striving Talents Ethics: A clear understanding of right and wrong, which guides your actions. Perhaps it is not telling your subordinate to lie to a supplier, or customer. Or maybe it is not being willing to have a good-old-boy network where you have your favorite workers stay in your office for extended meetings after lunch or smoke breaks with you, while the other workers are breaking knuckles turning wrenches. It is neither fair to the company, which expects work to be done during the periods that payroll is expected to compensate, nor those busting knuckles.\n\nThank you for this book, Mr. Buckingham and Mr. Coffman.\"",
    "There's some really great stuff in here. Ideas that challenge your perceptions, plans that you can work on tomorrow, and a number of opportunities for learning.\n\nBut I can't give it more than a 3 because it's all hidden behind a wall of \"Gallup did this, with this many people, for this reason, because this reason, and Gallup were the first to do this, because this, this and this affected this, this and this, for this many people.\n\nAs with many business books, you could cut comfortably half the content and only stand to gain.",
    "The book explains the outcome of research across many industries and roles on how best to hire, motivate and develop employees. There are some good ideas, knowledge and techniques.\nOverall, I found the conclusions outdated and not ground breaking, certainly nothing to live up to the title \"break all the rules\". All the principles proposed as common knowledge and part of most training courses or reading material in this subject. The book may have been revolutionary in the past but not now.\nI also found the content could have been condensed into a shorter book and still convey as much information.",
    "So far I have red dozens of books dealing with managing people, but this one is clearly the best one. As a reference, the Author condensed 20 years of research into it, so it's not some one-time-wonder. Well and interestingly written he explains why conventional knowledge about management is wtong and how you should approach managing people to make them excelling in their roles, being happy and performing excellently. I implemented only some of things so far and results are visible.",
    "In this book some people with a background in the Gallup organization research the recipe of success for great managers. In this book the key to their resulting framework is the following distinction between conventional wisdom and great managers: Conventional wisdom encourages managers to: 1) select a person 2) set expectations 3) motivate the person 4) develop the person. The best managers: 1) select for talent 2) define the right outcomes 3) they focus on strengths 4) help their people find the right fit. Also useful is their distinction between knowledge and skills and talent. Knowledge and skills can be acquired, talent cannot. The best managers look for talent in their people and move people into the position where there talent can blossom. They also spend the most time with your top performers. All in all a good book but not an instant classic. Buckingham observes the world and draws some pretty interesting conclusions. If he had capitalized on those insights with further recommendations to managers on how they could develop into great managers he would have earned four stars.",
    "I recently undertook a course about managing performance and the trainer recommended this book and it is one of the best business books I have ever read.The chapters were well written and I finished it in no time, I couldn't put it down. The 12 questions which we were introduced to and continually referred to in the book were like an epiphany, some very basic but as someone who works with people I wasn't sure how to answer them myself, it was very powerful. Its a pretty cheap book but its a great place to start for those new to management."

    "This book is amazing and hilarious. The way jen breaks down the mindset behind money & how to attract it by combining real life examples is amazing. Her sense of humor really comes through too and it makes it such an enjoyable read. If you are ready to make more money in your life check out this book asap",
    "I purchased the print edition on Amazon.ca and liked it so much that I purchased the Kindle edtion here on Amazon.com. I purchased this book out of curiosity because it had hit the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. As a international best-selling author whose books have sold over 1,000,000 copies, I like to figure out why a book does so well. Results don't lie, of course. After reading about two-thirds of the book, I can say \"You are a Badass at Making Money\" is a great book and I can see why it has done so well.\n\nBut this book is not for the Dummies of this world. It's a book for creative, motivated people like me who don't suffer from the victim mentality or the world-owes-me-a-living syndrome.\n\nJen Sincero incorporates her great sense of humor throughout the book. For example, while talking about money and the energy it represents Jen says, \" . . . the fifty bucks you make by raking leaves for the lady across the street has a very different energy than the fifty bucks you steal out of some guy’s pocket on the subway.\"\n\nIncidentally, Jen Sincero was broke and in debt, in her words, doing things like buying food at dollar stores, until her 40s. After getting her act together, she now makes seven figures a year.\n\nThis book has motivated me to get back to my creative projects and earn some real bucks again. You will hear about this later. Just a note that I don't really need to make more money. I just want to show that opportunities abound and that it can be done by a person my age. I want to show people that at the age of 72 I can still create works that will help me earn over $500,000 in one year. The best I ever did was have a pretax income of $339,000 in 2015 but Jen Sincero has motivated me to hit the half million mark.",
    "The book felt like an upgrade Think and Grow Rich. In this book Jen Sincero shared how you can upgrade your life and be a badass",
    "This author’s entire book collection will speak to you on many levels. She tells it like it is and makes problem-solving fun. I highly recommend!",
    "As with so many other self-help books, this boils down to the same basic principles:\n\n• Use self-awareness/mindfulness and meditation to become aware of your limiting core beliefs\n• Use positive thinking and visualisation to counteract your limiting core beliefs\n• Habitually become a more positive thinker\n• Positive thoughts and consequent positive feelings prompt you to take action on what you want to achieve\n• More action leads to more success\n\nThere. I've saved you a few hours.",
    "I have to say, I'm torn on these types of self-help books. My rational mind is telling me that this is a load of BS, but I can't deny the actual physical effect of reading and listening to this and Sincero's other Book \"You are a Badass\". Basically, it boils down to the power of positive thinking and putting yourself in a position to succeed rather than constantly telling yourself \"I Can't make money\". Sometimes you just need someone to tell you that, and Jen Sincero does that very well.",
    "The best book I've read on this subject. For so long I wanted to travel and this book gave me the get up and go to make it happen. I even found a book series that helps me do each country on $250 or less. Started in Thailand. And have cut from $5,000 a month state side to $250 a month travelling. Check out the 'Nickel and Dime Adventures' for a step by step on how to do it.",
    "I really loved “you are a badass “ but I think this book very repetitive. Jen speaks a lot about energy, visualisation and meditation but there are not many practical advices ( money wise ). I would say it’s useful for someone who likes books like “the secret “ and who loves to live by the concept of energy in their everyday life.",
    "I started of reading and understanding in the first pages the need for the mindset stuff, because I recently finished reading the The secret by Rhonda Byrne , however as I continued I realised that down the line there's not going to be much more because the information was getting repeated over and over again, there was a lot of fillers, the book literally delivered the same message across 260 pages when I've gotten the message in the first 50, regarding the mindset stuff, I was looking forward to have practical tools from the writer, because the book is about money but it was not worth the money."

    "Great companies do not become great by accident; they become great through the strategic choices they make. Great companies do not remain great by inertia; they remain great through the strategic choices they make. Procter and Gamble (P&G) is a great company by any measure. In 2012, it recorded $83.68 billion dollars in sales and Fortune magazine ranked the company the fifth most admired in the world.\nLafley was the Chairman and CEO of (P&G) through one of the most challenging periods in its history. When he took over the leadership position P&G was no longer delivering the outstanding returns. P&G was considered too big to continue being a growth stock. With Lafley at the helm, it achieved the near impossible, growth at a pace rarely associated with mature, enormous firms.\nThis book is about how a strong commitment to strategy, at every level, and in every part of the organization made this possible. In P&G's case, this was not a commitment to the board’s strategy, (a surprisingly rare event anywhere,) but a strong commitment to thinking about one’s division, department or business unit using a strategy method.\nStrategy is one of the most misused and misunderstood concepts in business. Lafley cites ideas often mistaken for strategy. ‘Strategy’ is often misunderstood as ‘a vision,’ which offers no guidance “to productive action and no explicit road map to the desired future.”\nStrategy is not a plan or a set of tactics; those are only elements of strategy. Strategy is certainly not leaving control to chance and watching what emerges. Strategy is not following best practices -sameness is not strategy, it is a recipe for mediocrity.\nStrongly committed to some of the principles espoused by Michael Porter and to using his terminology, Lafley and co-author, Professor Roger Martin, describe their playbook: Five Choices, One Framework, One Process.\nThe title “Playing to Win” is a central theme of Lafley’s approach. “Winning should be at the heart of any strategy,” in fact, it would make no sense to Lafley to aspire to anything less than winning.\nIn order to beat the competition, two key questions need to be answered. They are – “where to play,” and “how to win.” The strategic decisions made for P&G products are used to illustrate the application of this method.\nThe skincare product, Oil of Olay, was getting “tired” and sales were declining, but brand recognition was still strong, and it was still profitable. People were calling Oil of Olay, “Oil of Old Lady.” Applying the question, where should it play, they identified that the existing customers were price sensitive and only minimally invested in skin care. However, they also identified a new set of customers, who had real growth potential, the thirty-five-plus age cohort that was beginning to notice their first lines and wrinkles.\nTo win, P & G scientists went to work on sourcing and developing better and more effective compounds. This would create a skin-care product that could dramatically outperform existing products in the market. Olay fits in a product category where price is an indicator of value, but P&G was designed for mass markets, and so they developed an additional category, “masstige” a mass-market prestige version of their product. Priced high enough to give substantial margins, indicate value, and appeal to the upper end of the mass market, they revitalise the brand, attracted a younger consumer, and expanded their offering.\nThey had answered the strategic question, “where to play,” and “how to win.” These strategic questions were followed by the operationalization of the answers in the form of two other questions: What capabilities must be in place and what management systems would be required to ensure successful implementation.\nStrategic thinking using the five principles was not the preserve of the board - rather it was a process to be followed everywhere in the organization.\nUsing the same strategy process, the marketing department reformulated their mandate. An essential element in P&G’s company strategy is the classification of the customer as “the Boss” whose needs must be understood accurately and satisfied better than expected.\nTo this end, marketing defined where they should play as the conducting of innovative market research using edgy techniques. All conventional research, such as surveys and focus groups, would be outsourced. They could have chosen to play in the conventional research field and outsourced the edgy techniques, but chose not to in order to serve their customer more effectively than an external provider could.\nStrategy is all about making choices.\nThis is not a ‘how-to’ book on strategy according to Porter. Porter, an industrial economist turned strategist, was in his prime in the 80s. His thinking is still relevant to behemoths in manufacturing, with some important modifications. He is certainly not applicable to many other businesses without modification and manipulation.\nThis extremely valuable book is a testament to the importance of instituting thinking strategically throughout an organization to deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. This is the first comprehensive account of this means I have ever come across, and what a powerful example at that. P&G has had an outstanding record during some of the most difficult years in business and has succeeded.\nTake this seriously. Very seriously.\n\nReadability Light --+-- Serious\nInsights High -+--- Low\nPractical High -+--- Low\n\nIan Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy",
    "So what do Bounty paper towels have to do with the strategy question? It’s a fascinating case study noted in chapter three of this fascinating book on strategy, \"Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works\" (Harvard Business Review Press, 2013).\n\nIt’s so fascinating I now bring a Bounty paper towel roll to client sessions on strategic planning.\n\nAt Procter & Gamble in 2001, the president of global family care (the tissue and towel division) saw sales of Bounty plateau in North America. They wondered: could future growth come from Europe, Asia and Latin America?\n\nSo in addressing a key strategy question—where to play (chapter three)—the P&G team went back to the drawing table and invested in research. “Deep consumer understanding is at the heart of the strategy discussion,” the authors insist. And they should know.\n\nCo-author A.G. Lafley is the former chairman of the board, president, and CEO of Procter and Gamble. Co-author Roger L. Martin is dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. In 2011, Martin was named by Thinkers50 as the sixth top management thinker in the world. (Not a bad plaque for your office wall.)\n\nSo what did paper towel users—the consumers—tell P&G about Bounty?\n\nBounty “had by far the best equity in its category—one of the strongest brand equities in the company,” the division president reported. “If you asked, virtually 100 percent of the people would say Bounty is a great brand and a really good product. Then some would go off and buy something else.” So they drilled down farther. Obviously, something was wrong with this picture!\n\nThen they did the hard work—they asked the consumer even more. Or as Peter Drucker urges in his classic five questions: #2—Who is the customer? And #3: What does the customer value? (By the way, the book’s dedication: “Inspired by Peter Drucker (1909-2005), mentor and friend.”)\n\nThe Bounty team identified three distinct types of paper towel users:\n• Group 1 cared about “both strength and absorbency. For this group, Bounty was a perfect fit—a great combination of the two attributes they cared most about. The team found that among these consumers, Bounty was already the clear winner.”\n\n• Group 2 wanted “a paper towel with a cloth-like feel. They didn’t care much about strength or absorbency, certainly much less than the core Bounty group did. Rather, this group of customers cared about how soft the paper towel felt in their hand.”\n\nPaper towels? Really, Pearson? (Really—keep reading. The big idea is coming.)\n\n• Group 3 had “price as their top priority, though not as their sole concern. The need of those consumers was also on strength. It wasn’t at all on absorbency, because they had a compensating behavior to address the absorbency shortfalls of lower-price paper towel products: they would simply use more sheets.”\n\nBased on consumer research, Bounty decided to serve all three segments with the development of two new products. So at stores across North America today, you’ll find three choices:\n--Bounty\n--Bounty Extra Soft\n--Bounty Basic\n\nInterestingly, Bounty Basic is stronger than its competing low-priced paper towels and costs about 75 percent less that the traditional Bounty paper towels. And get this—Bounty Basic is stocked on shelves far away from the traditional Bounty.\n\nRaise your hand if you already knew all of this! (I didn’t.)\n\nThe big idea? One size doesn’t fit all. You already knew that, but when is the last time you did a careful, detailed analysis of every program, product, or service you offer? Have you hit a sales plateau? Are you forcing one program down the throats of three or more very diverse customer segments?\n\n(Memo to nonprofit CEOs and fundraisers writing your year-end appeals: Stop sending me mail and emails thanking me for my faithful support—if I’ve never given you any money. Start with two segments: current donors and non-donors. For more insight, read  Development 101: Building a Comprehensive Development Program on Biblical Values .)\n\nStudy \"Playing to Win\" with your team and you’ll appreciate the practical approach to creating a winning strategy. You’ll learn what strategy is, and what strategy is all about (choice).\n\nRead pages 4 and 5—and you’re hooked (and convicted)! The authors list five ineffective ways that many leaders tend to address the strategy process:\n1) “They define strategy as vision.\n2) They define strategy as a plan.\n3) They deny that long-term (or even medium-term) strategy is possible.\n4) They define strategy as the optimization of the status quo.\n5) They define strategy as following best practices.”\n\nLafley and Martin add, “Every industry has tools and practices that become widespread and generic. Some organizations define strategy as benchmarking against competition and then doing the same set of activities but more effectively. Sameness isn’t strategy. It is a recipe for mediocrity.”",
    "I loved this book as it makes a few points about strategy very well. Clearly, the authors have significant experience and insight as to where brands need to play and how to win when they get there. These insights, in my opinion, are relevant to all managers wanting to alter and simplify their strategy culture. The authors experience with Proctor & Gamble is used to validate the usefulness of their simple process.\n\nHaving worked for Unilever myself (way, way back in the day) it was endearing to be reminded by this book how brands, when treated as a real persona and taken seriously, are able to deliver huge rewards. Anecdotes aplenty about Tide, Olay, Febreze, etc., are used to explain their framework of: Where to play? How to win; What capabilities are needed and what management systems are required.\n\nThe book has its limitations obviously, yet it's clearly and concisely written. It makes many valuable points simply and unobtrusively. Since its practical for most and treats strategy with respect - I loved it.",
    "Every once in a long while you come across a thinker who has such a magnificent command of the facts, wide ranging intellectual creativity, but most of all clarity of expression that you simply think –‘of course – that’s amazing - why didn’t I think of that!’. Roger Martin is one of those thinkers who can review the world of business and strategy with intellectual rigor and convey it in such a clear, convincing way you remember his key arguments years later.\n\nIn Playing To Win, Roger Martin teams up with A.G. Lafley to explain the process of creating strategic decisions told through the story of the strategic decision making at P&G while A.G.Lafley was CEO and Roger Martin was his chief outside strategic advisor. At a time when many executives would synonymise strategy with financial planning, or creation of yearly goals, Lafley and Martin remind us that strategy boils down to two questions: ‘where to play?’ and ‘how to win?’ and then making specific choices. In Martin and Lafley’s words:\n\n“A strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of where-to-play, how-to-win, core capability, and management system choices that uniquely meet a customer’s needs…it is only through making and acting on choices that you can win. Yes, clear, tough choices force your hand and confine you to a path. But they also free you to focus on what matters.”\n\nIn the penultimate chapter, Martin and Lafley describe in detail their techniques to think through strategic issues in a way that leads to real decisions, not rafts of analyst reports and is the only method Martin now uses. I won’t spoil what is perhaps the most valuable part of the book, but suffice to say that once I started this chapter I could not put down the book and despite a long week, read late into the night.\n\nPlaying to Win: How strategy really works is nothing short of brilliant, and if you are a strategist, or just a manager trying to figure out how to grow or turn around your business you should have a dog-eared copy on your bookshelf next to Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy.",
    "Really disappointed, bought this book on the basis it would be in good condition, but there is writing and notes across all the pages. Also the book cover was missing. This wasn't as advertised, and I'm really disappointed, won't buy from these again!",
    "ok as a book but tended to focus mainly on two or three case studies. The general principles and diagrams were great. You could get away with just reading the summary at the end of each chapter and looking for the diagrams. Still I learnt a lot but book could have been written better",
    "Very easy to read with lots of really useful content. The approaches outlined are applicable to all industries not just FMCG. It helped to cement some ideas I already had (or had learned) but offers very clear methods to drive a strategy in your organisation, accounting for very different and often opposing views. Highly recommended"

    "I purchased the book for my son who is looking to get into the commercial construction industry, and I'm going off of what he told me. If you are looking to learn pretty much everything there is about the construction industry, from the types of projects, to project procurement, different delivery methods, estimation and pricing, and so on and so forth, this book provides a very in - depth analysis of every possible area of the field you could think of. It's very well written and covers every possible sector of the industry in immense detail.\n\nWith that being said, I would have loved to see a few more real - world examples in the book. The review questions are nice for reinforcing the knowledge, and there are a few asides where the author talks about some real - world instances, but ultimately, you will need to get onto a construction job site to truly make the most out of this knowledge. This book is great for anyone in the engineering field who may be considering a career in construction, but you definitely will need to get some experience to make the most of what you learn in the book. I encourage reading it without skipping a single page, as every word in this text is useful regarding all things construction.",

    "Easy read that truly clears the cobwebs off FI. Anybody who is serious about FI must read this book NOW.",
    "This is an excellent book that I\nthink everyone should read. It will help you see your finances and your work in a new way. Of course, not everyone can do everything in the book. It's probably not going to help people who are incarcerated or in an extreme state of poverty. But I do think it can help most people to re-think how they experience money.",
    "A couple of years ago I counted all the personal finance books that I had read (as I began to downsize my collection and get rid of most of them) and I counted 43. That really surprised me as I had never thought that I could have possibly read as many -after all, if I had my back turned to the bookshelf I probably could only name 10. Without a doubt, this book/cd would be in the top 5 that I have ever read/listened to.\n\nOk, so this isn't a book, but it is based off of a book, which I have read, and which is a more detailed version of this CD. Having had read the book I wasn't sure that I would get as much out of the CD, but I was wrong. I have already listened to the (second) CD three times, and each time I got a little more out of it.\n\nWhat makes this CD so powerful is that the approach is not a method, or a system, it is deeper than that, and it ties to your core values. It approaches finance by having you look at how you think and how you spend, and it shares an understanding of how you translate your thoughts into an accounting of your life energy -the limited time on earth that you have to work at your job, earn money, and be with your family. It is as much a CD of philosophy, as it is of finance. Having read the book a year earlier, and having listened to the CD afterwards I suddenly started realizing that a lot of the little purchases that I was making were only delaying my true life goals. Things that I used to spend money on without thinking, now don't call out to me as much, and things that are more in tune with what I really want, seem even more appealing. This isn't about scrimping and saving, this is about finding your priorities and asking yourself with every purchase -is this taking me closer, or further away from my life goals? It is so empowering; your life goals are YOUR life goals -they are not someone else's, and your goals can't be \"wrong\". Whatever is important to you, is what you focus on.\nThe first CD is an introductory CD, and is worthwhile listening to, but not something I would listen to over and over. The second CD, however, is where the philosophy is broken out, and where the genius lies.\n\nWhat a wonderful CD, and what a wonderful companion book. If you don't like reading, or are not sure about \"studying\" a book, then I highly recommend buying this CD and listening to it -at least twice. If, after that, you feel like it means something to you, then go out and buy the book.\n\nI offer this philosophy my highest recommendation. If done well, it can truly change your life.",
    "Basic principles of this book are decent, however, the principles are not gold and it could be summed up well in 50 pages or less...not the redundant, ranting 300 page book it is.\nFirst 80 pages of the book are worthless and torture mostly focusing on the consumerism/doomed/horrible smog-infested society we live in, last two chapters most useful and can be read in a bookstore.\nI did not like many examples given; it seemed to focus on divorce excessively with ~ 80% of case report examples of \"FI-ers\" being divorced which I found rather odd and unnecessary to mention.\nTake home points of this book: Spend less than you earn, save, document every penny you spend, become a minimalist and only purchase things you need, the less you need the more fulfilled you will be, the less you will work, etc.\nThings to consider:\n1) The \"FIer\" lifestyle is not for everyone- I equate an \"FIer\" to the tiny home movement in principle.\n2) Book recommends that bonds should be the mainstay and the only thing in your portfolio. I strongly would discourage this. \"Safe\" bonds which I pretty much consider anything that that is not a junk bond or preferred stock bond, are not hitting the high yields that Joe Dominguez saw in his day and on many years aren't comparing to rises in inflation. While you can never predict the stock market, when looking at time tables- it always goes up. Traditionally, stock markets rise while bond yields go down some and visa versa. The best way for security and safety is proper allocation to each of these modalities: bonds (treasury bonds are great as mentioned in the book because you aren't charged state taxes, however, what the book fails to remind you of is that federal taxes are still fair game) and diversified stock portfolio most safely done by investing in mutual index funds with low fees (e.g. Vanguard). The older you are, for safety, the more bonds you should have in case the stock market plummets during your retirement years. For conservatives a 60% mutual funds and 40% bonds is recommended. For a retirement person, 20% stocks and 80% bonds should be considered. When you have all your eggs in one basket, you lose that safety net.\n3) Other things I disagree with in this book- everyone should have health insurance, you should not forgo this to \"save\" money; sure buy the less comprehensive plan if you are healthy and pay less and have a higher deductible but you are gambling when you forgo it all together.\n4) They also suggest in this book \"rolling-over\" your 401k and 403b accounts to bonds; however, these are pre-taxed dollars and you will likely get slammed- most retirement plans now give options to the \"risk\" or rather stock/bond ratio you desire. I would more likely suggest rolling money to Roth IRAs (post-tax and therefore tax free with capital gains) or just leave your nest egg to compound growth where they are at.\nNow I am ranting. Cheers.",

    "If you know the basics about personal finance, then this book is not for you. I can't say I learnt anything from this book. It never goes into detail about anything. The chapter I was most looking forward to in this book, was the one about investing in incoming producing assets. However this was very disappointing as all it stated was \"invest in assets that create income\". Stated she made lots of money investing in bonds when the interests rates were good, but advises against them now, however no alternatives were given. If you're new the financial independence world then this book maybe of use to you, otherwise I'd avoid it.",
    "I found this to be a very engaging read. The crux of it is that we should all be equating our income to units of time (of our life - hence the title). By doing this, you work out the price of something in hours/weeks or whatever, rather than £££s.\nSo an item valued £100, is worth a lot more to someone who earns £50 a week than it is for someone who earns £1000 A week.\nThis, in theory, should help us make better decision regarding how we spend our hard earned cash.\nChanging your mindset in this way could help stop you spending mindlessly on things that aren't really essential or even really wanted. Good advice!\nThe book is probably longer than it needs to be. I'll probably read it a second time to recap some of the useful tips/advice.\nI recommend that everyone starts to think in this way when it comes to their finances!",

    "- a very good resource for those who have not yet studied, read about or been thought about the principles of financial independence.\n- prompts you to think deeply about your core values and understand what is truly important to you.\n- points you in the direction of taking action according to those values - only spending on what brings you genuine joy and what you actually need to live\n\n- there are many other, better books regarding specific investment strategies.

    "I've been following his podcast for a while now. I'm not a huge reader but I've been on a trauma-healing journey for the last 1.5 years and this book has been really helpful in identifying things in my past, pin-pointing my current habits and how they effect me. It can take some time to go through the book, especially because it brings up some feelings (at least for me) but in a good way. Taking the time to reflect and process is really important!\n\nI already bought the book for a friend and would buy them for all my friends if I could!",
    "We all been to some tough times in our life. This book will help you to give you clarity and i feel like it was a guide to me for my self assessment and free me from my past traumas",
    "I have been on a journey to learn about myself and this book offers new insights into that whole journey to emotional and mental wellness due to injuries sustained by my family of origin as a child.",
    "Great book...holds your attention also (not boring or hard to read) I really needed the message and even plan to read it again.",
    "I love everything he puts out. This is such a helpful resource and so applicable in life I highly recommend it!",
    "Easy read, apples to everyone. I think anyone would better themselves by reading and following this book. I highly recommend and passed on to a friend once I finished. I believed in it so much",
    "Really great book. Love the “bricks in your backpack” concept.",
    "I bought this for my husband who has been struggling with heightened anxiety and stress. I read it the day I received it. I heard the author, Dr. John Delony and Dave Ramsey on the radio talking about pur traumatic or just hurtful stories being like bricks in a backpack that we continue to carry... I jotted the title and ordered as soon as I got home. Fabulous writing style that keeps you engaged. So many \"ah ha\" thoughts that I actually pulled out my highlighter. I recommend to every human because anyone and everyone can certainly relate. Buy it for your struggling family member, but read it first :)",
    "The book has been mostly interesting. Some mix of personal stories but also categorisation which I find helpful. It was written in a simple style. Worth a read if you like this sort of personal growth style work. Good for any reader as it’s broken down with nice examples.\n\nI did get a bit of a misprint on one page so far but it’s not bad enough to try and get a refund. It only covers a few words. Not ideal though",
    "A bit waffly and disorganised.",
    "I am an avid listener of The John Delony podcast. Reading his book was all I expected it to be: thoughtful, deep, and healing. Thank you for this gift to my journey.",
    "I really respect Dr John-This book is changing my life and others lives around me. FANTASTIC"

    "My book was a little damaged “renegades “ born in the USA, the corners but I was ready to read it so I didn’t send it back",
    "This is a great documentary book of the Renegade podcast series. Wonderful photos and commentary by these two great men.",
    "This is an interesting book and reflects well on both of these Renegades. Fascinating and fun illustrations. However, this is the latest of many books from Amazon.com that ARRIVED WITH BASHED CORNERS.",
    "I first learned about the book while watching the CBS Sunday Morning Show a few weeks ago when they had the interview with Obama and Springsteen, and I knew immediately if I could have just one thing for Christmas, this book was it. Fortunately Santa (my wife) delivered and since then, I haven't been able to put it down. (Disclaimer; as I voted for Obama twice, and have seen the Boss in concert seven times, I had a strong bias going in that I would enjoy the book) Suffice it to say just halfway through the book, it has exceeded my wildest expectations and if possible, I would give it a 10 star rating. Briefly, the pictures alone ( many of which I'd never seen before), make the book a keeper but far beyond that, \"listening in\" on a lengthy conversation between two icons, who despite coming from totally different backgrounds, have developed the most improbable close friendship. How a graduate of Harvard Law School from Hawaii who became the first African American President, and a white high school kid from Freehold, New Jersey who became a rock and roll legend came together is a story by itself, but \"hearing\" them share their personal thoughts about everything from politics to music to family with no holds barred is a real treasure. Even to those who didn't particularly care for Obama's politics, or who prefer listening to Tim McGraw or Carrie Underwood instead of the Boss, this STILL is a book well worth reading and I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "This is a very I teresting book. Would highly recommend. Love the both of them and wish I could see Bruce on Broadway, he's a bit out of my budget",
    "Overall I highly recommend this. President Obama is Legendary! The only thing I would suggest is to have this interact with a Quantum Computer. Semper Fi.",
    "The photos are wonderful. The chemistry between both of them is priceless. You can read a few pages....thumb through a few......come back to it......and I just know you will love it.",
    "An unbelievable collaboration between Two One-of-a-Kind Men. A Perfect Read to accompany me into the New Year of 2022 ~ Year of The Tiger! Even Knowing in advance that I'll love this book. Absolutely! The reality of how much I'm so blown away & mesmerized by the authors ~ is still unreal.\n\nMy favorite part of the book is \"IN PERFORMANCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE\" SERIES, 2009-2015. The most memorable one is Bruce Springsteen's solo concert for the Staff the last month of President Obama's Presidency.\n\nI will treasure this book of a casual yet brilliant conversation between a politician and a rock star who have reached the pinnacle of their vocation and profession. Whenever I feel helpless or hopeless I will reread certain quotes and lyrics to keep my optimism ~ hope ~ faith going.\n\nHere's an example of what I'm talking about:\n\n❣️You gotta keep the lantern lit, my friend.\n❣️Yes! Exactly.\n❣️That's the bottom line.\n❣️Right. That America is true and real and available to you. I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but it's there.",
    "Ce livre est la retranscription des conversations entre Obama et Springsteen, parues en podcast il y a quelques mois, accompagnées de nombreuses photos (en 302 pages). Il s'agit de la version originale, il vaut donc mieux bien maîtriser l'anglais pour saisir leurs échanges passionnants et leurs nuances. 2 personnages qui incarnent des facettes différentes du \"rêve américain\": Bruce, un petit gars du New Jersey, fou de rock et de soul, qui a créé un des plus grands groupes au monde, avec ses potes qu'il connaît parfois depuis l'adolescence, le E Street Band. Une véritable bête de scène capable d'électriser un stade entier pendant 3 ou 4h! Face à lui, celui qui est devenu son ami assez récemment, Barack, né à Hawaï, et élu 44e président des Etats-Unis, après avoir été travailleur social à Chicago puis avocat. Le 1er président noir de l'histoire du pays. Des destins différents mais partageant des valeurs communes, Bruce n'a jamais caché ses idées politiques et on les connaît depuis longtemps. Mais c'est avant tout un échange humain et amical qu'on lit, 2 exemples de réussite à force de travail et de volonté farouche, la croyance aussi profonde chez les 2 qu'on peut changer la société, l'améliorer, la faire réagir et réfléchir, que ce soit par la musique ou la politique. Obama l’explique quand Bruce lui demande ce qui l’a motivé à se présenter comme président : « (…) this idea of bringing America into alignment with its ideals. That had been my work, that had been my purpose ». Ils abordent de nombreux sujets, de leur passé (le fait d'avoir mal connu leur père tous les 2 les a rapprochés), la société américaine et les tensions très fortes, les failles béantes qui existent encore aujourd'hui et le travail gigantesque qui reste à accomplir. Et puis l'amitié, la place centrale de la famille et bien entendu la musique, Barack étant un fan de musiques, les 2 s'amusent à lancer des noms et à réagir parmi lesquels on trouve sans grande surprise Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Dylan, Presley. Impossible à résumer en quelques lignes ce livre dense tellement ces propos sont vastes, n'éludant pas la présidence Trump et les troubles qu'elle a provoqués. Les photos sont belles mais pas si rares que ça (surtout les photos en concert de Bruce), sauf peut-être pour les photos touchantes en famille prises dans l'intimité. 2 parcours hors-norme d'hommes qui s'interrogent (et nous interrogent par la même occasion) sur les Etats-Unis d'hier et d'aujourd'hui et aussi plus largement sur le monde actuel, les inquiétudes et les espoirs qu'il peut soulever, le tout avec humilité et humour. Obama le note bien en intro: \"We didn't come up with any simple formulas for resolving America's ongoing conflicts. As different as our backgrounds are, as much as we've tried in our work to give voice to the thousands of people whom we've met along the way, neither Bruce nor I claim to capture all the divergent perspectives and attitudes that make up the big, raucous country of ours\". A noter que leurs réflexions portent aussi sur l’écriture et des photos de discours d’Obama et de paroles manuscrites de Springsteen (avec leurs nombreuses corrections) figurent dans le livre et c’est fabuleux : on voit le travail effectué par les 2, différent bien sûr puisqu’une chanson doit raconter une histoire en quelques minutes seulement, là où un discours peut durer beaucoup plus longtemps et prendre son temps. Mais le travail sur le choix des mots, la construction des phrases, l’effet maximum recherché est visible et permet de mieux les comprendre. Un indispensable évidemment.",
    "An excellent and important book",
    "This book is about America’s promise .\n\nObama and Springsteen understand that it is the idea of America , and the reconciliation of its ideals with its darker side that defines America’s destiny.\n\nThis is a hip popular culture conversation that is accessible and interesting and mixes mediums to project the message that America’s diversity is its strength, and its still the world’s best hope because the conversation is still happening in real time",

    "I read this book for a book club at work. I wasn’t exactly thrilled that a management book was chosen as our next book, especially since I am not a manager myself. However, I did see that High Output Management had received rave reviews here on Goodreads. I also saw an article from the Washington Post highlighting this book becoming a cult classic in Silicon Valley with plenty of recommendations from top CEOs. And the recently updated edition has a foreword by Ben Horowitz, who apparently has been the chief promoter of the book in tech circles. He’s a gazillionaire. He’s smart. And The Lean Startup, another Silicon Valley favorite, was quite good. Maybe this will actually be useful. I could not have been more wrong.\n\nHigh Output Management is one of the worst books I’ve ever read. I repeat. High Output Management, lauded by Brian Chesky, Mark Zuckerburg, and Ben Horowitz, is one of the worst books I have ever read. Now, if you liked this book, you might be thinking, “What do I care what this guy has to say about this book? He’s not even a manager. It was probably just over his head. He doesn’t understand.” Allow me to make my case.\n\nThe pain starts with the foreword. Ben Horowitz begins to froth at the mouth about Andy Grove, otherworldly CEO of Intel - the greatest company ever to exist. Horowitz seems to equate Grove and High Output Management to Jesus and the Bible.\nAnyone who was anyone in Silicon Valley read this book back when it was first released… Look how cool the cover is. He’s still wearing his key card in the photo! Wow!\nHorowitz proceeds to explain the one decent piece of insight of the entire book, that a managers’ output is the output of his subordinates and those under his influence. Then he explains how amazing, absolutely Earth-shattering it is that Andy Grove will share how he runs his meetings. This is what I get to look forward to for the next 200 pages? Kill me now…\n\nAfter Horowitz’s teenage gush fest, Grove begins the book with a deeply technical explanation of the process to prepare breakfast at a restaurant. The first step is to identify the limiting step, the step in the breakfast prep that takes the longest to complete. Then plan the entire job around that step.\nOkay, cool... Not related to anything any of the people who probably read this book work on. It’s more appropriate for an assembly line environment, but okay. He’s using a metaphor. It’ll probably come full circle later on. WRONG! It never comes full circle.\nAnd we arrive at my first major gripe about this book: High Output Management is meant for a production manager on the floor at a manufacturing plant whose sole job is to spit out as many bits and thingys as possible. Anyone not spending their job doing the same thing over and over again in a more-is-better environment will gain almost no value here. The back cover explains how it is “equally appropriate for consultants, teachers, as well as CEOs and startup founders.” And yet, there is no real mention of how this relates to any of them or the modern knowledge worker in general. Which leads me to wonder, why are so many startup founders, in massively unpredictable and creative environments, worshipping this nonsense?\n\nNot only is the book mostly irrelevant, it’s hard to follow. Andy Grove consistently uses grossly overcomplicated reasoning and terminology to explain simple concepts. One quote that I like is, “Most geniuses – especially those who lead others – prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.” Grove has no understanding of this concept. High Output Management is littered with complex formulas and unnecessary diagrams that will lull even the most studious professional into a blank stare. Entire chapters could have been written in one paragraph. The chapter called, “Task-Relevant Maturity,” could have been written in one sentence: Learn about your subordinates so you know how to manage them. That’s it. Instead we got a calculus lesson. I can only equate Grove’s obfuscating to trying to sound smart.\nHe also can’t seem to call things as they are. Grove insists on using bizarre labels to describe very common things. A meeting organizer is a “chairman.” Weekly updates are “operation reviews.” WTF? NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. And perhaps it’s the use of buzzwords like “managerial leverage” and “task-relevant maturity” that deceives the reader that Grove actually isn’t writing about anything new. All of his talking points, when you strip away the useless management-speak, are just the same tips you see in a typical article in Fast Company. Set a meeting agenda, train your employees, have one-on-one meetings with your subordinates. Useful for sure. But if this is your first time hearing that the meeting organizer should prepare the agenda, you don’t read enough.\n\nAnother theme of the book I have a problem with is that Andy Grove sees human effort as just another metric to quantify and optimize for. Our subordinates can be tinkered with to accomplish our goals if only we have the right equation. Maybe this is what attracts those in the startup community. That even human beings can be hacked by putting the right code into the machine. Grove obviously isn’t the first to think this way about managing others. But it’s a way of thinking that has caused generational resentment towards Corporate America.\n\nSomehow, despite all of these flaws, Andy Grove could almost be forgiven if he didn’t commit this one fallacy: Grove doesn’t acknowledge how he concluded which/if any of his methods actually caused Intel’s or any of their managers’ success. He didn’t even isolate the characteristics of his top managers versus the average so we could at least guess for ourselves. All of the arguments were purely anecdotal and most likely suffering from confirmation bias, leaving the assembly line supervisors with only Grove’s word that these tactics actually work.\n\nGrove mentions how delegation is an essential aspect of management. Um… Really? You’re telling me Steve Jobs was a legendary CEO because he was great at delegating? This is all you need to know about this and practically every other management book. In my opinion, what every book about management misses is that management isn’t nearly as important as a manager thinks it is. If you want to be a great manager, provide your guidance and get out of the way. No one wants to be managed. People want to be lead. Real leaders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, notorious for being brutal bosses, have succeeded most likely in spite of their management skills. People like them succeed because they bring out the best in their team and inspire others to go where no one else has gone before. They seek to create a world that doesn’t yet exist and bring others along for the ride. This is the difference between a manager and a leader. Of course tasks like delegation, planning, and running effective meetings play a role, but no one is buying that they were the crux of Andy Grove’s success. This is a lesson that many people never learn. Most people, even the uber rich and successful, are terrible at understanding why they succeeded in a given domain. They often just pick the things that are obvious and easy to quantify.\n\nI think it’s not a stretch to think that I’ll be in a position of leadership at some point in my life. But when that day comes, I will not be using anything I learned from High Output Management.",
    "High Output Management provides a comprehensive overview of a managers role and purpose. The book focuses around a central thesis that a manager's objective is to increase the output of the work of those below and around him. A manager should therefore choose high-leverage activities that have a multiplicative impact on the overall output of his subordinates and peers. For example, providing clear direction to a team may only require a small amount of the manager's time, but yields tremendous value in terms of the output of the team.\n\nThis book is great for both new and experienced managers since it provides valuable frameworks and strategies for all kinds of common managerial tasks. Below are the core topics covered in this book:\n\n* Delegation - In order to maximize leverage, a manager needs an optimal number of subordinates to whom he can delegate to. Successful delegation provides lots of leverage, whereas poor delegation ends up netting no leverage since it turns into errors and micro-management.\n* Meetings - Meetings are extraordinarily expensive to a company. There are three types of recurring meetings: one-on-one's, staff meetings, and operational reviews. Each of these meetings should have a clear framework for maximizing value and minimizing time-waste. There are also one-off meetings centered around making a particular decision - such meetings should be especially carefully planned and executed since they are often scheduled ad-hoc without a clear purpose and with too many participants.\n* Making decisions - When making decisions, there's a fragile power dynamic that needs to be carefully handled. Managers should facilitate free and open discussion amongst all parties until a consensus emerges. In cases where a consensus does not emerge naturally, the manager should push for a decision.\n* Dual reporting - Dual reporting is inevitable in most large organizations. Consider advertising: should each division of a company decide and pursue its own advertising campaign, or should all of it be handled through a single corporate entity? The optimum solution calls for the use of dual reporting where each division controls most of their own advertising messages but a coordinating body of peers consisting of the various divisional marketing managers chooses the advertising agency and creative direction.\n* Motivating employees - Our society respects someone's throwing himself into sports, but anybody who works very long hours is regarded as sick or a workaholic. Imagine how productive our country would become if managers could endow all work with the characteristics of competitive sports? Eliciting peak performance means going up against something or somebody, and turning the workplace into a playing field where subordinates become athletes dedicated to performing at the limit of their capabilities.\n* Performance reviews - Performance reviews are easily mistaken as simply a way to assess performance and evaluate compensation. The fundamental goal of a performance review is to improve the subordinates performance. A review will influence a subordinate's performance for a long time, which makes the activity one of the manager's highest-leverage activities. Thus great care needs to be taken in the preparation and delivery of a performance review.",
    "A particularly great read for engineers moving into management.",
    "The best book I have ever read in my life.",
    "I'm an avid reader, but this is the first book that has moved me to write a review. In summary it's brilliant and absolutely still 100% relevant.\n\nAfter finishing reading through the book, I immediately started re-reading it. In the forward by Ben Horowitz, he writes\n\"First, in as little as one sentence, it lucidly explains concepts that require entire books from lesser writers. Second, it consistently uncovers brand-new management ideas or finds new insights into old standards. Finally, while most management books attempt to teach basic competency, High Output Management, teaches the reader how to be great.\"\nI think that's a really good summary. The first sentence is worth highlighting though. This book contains a ton of wisdom in 230 pages. If there's a flaw with the book, it's that it's too dense with wisdom. It's like an amazing teacher has condensed a full two-year Stanford MBA program into one small book. It is NOT a page turner (though he's a fine writer). There is so much in each page that you need to take breaks to think over what you just read before moving on.\n\nRegarding the forward, you can skip it the first time through. I think it's more useful as a summary review after reading through the book once.",
    "A fascinating read where Grove talks about how he pulled off the greatest transformation in the history of #Intel: moving from the memory business to microprocessors more than a decade after its founding.\n\nDuring his tenure at Intel Corporation, he described the different reorganisations that the company went through, with the only one which was effective - which just about every large company or enterprise that he knew was organised was in a hybrid form, which consisted of mission-oriented departments. This reminding me of product lines.\n\nAlthough it was published over 25 years ago, the management practices are timeless, where Grove touches on the negative impact of 'managerial meddling' (disempowerment) and he talks about productivity, work simplification and leverage with the goal to work smarter, not harder!\n\nAs Grove says \"..the single most important sentence of this book: The output of a manager is the output of the organisation units under his or her supervision or influence\".\n\nThe key to survival is to learn to add more value, which is ultimately what this book is about.\n\nA classic book on management, which I'd recommend.",
    "I found this book a fantastic source of actionable insight. Andy approach is very pragmatic, as you would expect from someone with an engineering background, which distinguishes this book from a mass of fluffy management literature. The perfect gift for someone just moved to a management position to quickly improve, or someone more experienced that would immediately relate with situations and benefit from such a successful CEO advice.",
    "old-fashioned ideas that might have worked in the 1970s but we've all moved on a lot since then. I particularly objected to his idea that in handling under-performing staff the only options you have are motivation and training. I would say this is not wrong, but it isn't helpful either. And what about \"vision\" in management? A lot of current problems are caused by blinkered attitudes and sheep-like behaviour. Grove has nothing to say on the topic.\nBut a good book nevertheless.",
    "I bought this because having read Philip Tetlock's Super forecasting (twice) I was curious as to why Cummings regards this as essential reading for his weirdo's and misfits. Basically it is about boiling an egg from a process engineers perspective. If Cummings and his misfits can't boil an egg then how are they going to do the big stuff. The UK is in trouble.",
    "One of the best business books I've read in a long time. Short book, common sense and to the point. Written by Andrew Grove former CEO of Intel.\n\nI would challenge anyone to review their own workplace, their own work practices using some of Grove's ideas.\n\nLiked the simple idea on the manager's preparation for decision making:\n\nWhat decision needs to be made?\n\nEnglish: Portrait of Andrew Grove. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nWhen does it have to be made?\nWho will decide?\nWho will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?\nWho will ratify or veto the dcision\nWho will need to be informed of the decision?\nPity it does not happen more often.\nOn meetings I think he is right: two types. Are we talking of a process oriented meeting (one-on-one, staff meetings, operations reviews) or a mission-oriented meeting?\nThe discussion of hybrid organisations and dual reporting is straightforward and recognises the reality of how many businesses need to be structured.\nLiked the honesty of his section on performance appraisal. And his clarity on the importance of this process, the need for preparation and the rationale for the process in the first instance.\nNot sure I fully agreed with him on his views on trying to retain people who say they are going to leave.\nFinally - he is very clear on the manager's role and responsibility for training - including preparation and delivery of training. I would see this as a major failing with many managers in industry. And a major missed opportunity."

    "if you have not buy the main book, but that first, then do this one; they are both good",
    "This was a fun workbook for my husband and I. We've enjoyed going through the exercises and plan to use these concepts when advising our students.",
    "It's a great companion to the book by the same authors. I really love these guys and what they are teaching, I'm so happy that there is a companion to their book. Highly recommend.",
    "There are pages that are repetitive, a lot. Not sure That many needed but the concepts are more easily designed when utilizing this planner. I would have gotten stuck much more without this guide. It is eye opening so be prepared. Why have I been doing activities I do Not enjoy, a Lot??? Get it, it may change your life!",
    "Great complement to the book. I highly recommend this book AND workbook to literally everyone. It helps you learn about your likes/dislikes and strengths/ weaknesses to give you better options at work and in life.",
    "This book has helped me increase the activities in my life that give me greater satisfaction and reduce the activities that drain me. By tracking my activities and scoring them on the \"engagement\" and \"energy\" gauges, I have been able to see for myself, what brings me joy and what doesn't. Then as I enter the next week, I work on doing more of what brings me joy and less of what doesn't. I'm not one to do workbooks but doing the exercises in this one, is truly helping me increase the quality of my life. Thanks Bill and Dave. I recommend this workbook to anyone wanting increased satisfaction in life and a blueprint for carving new and exciting paths.",
    "The book is well made and easy to turn the pages. It was shipped quickly. I haven’t started on the tasks as I’m working with others for the new year.",
    "Haven't started but it looks amazing and I can't wait to start, I have the book also!",
    "I had seen an interview with the two authors and as is often the case, they alluded to much but didn't say anything really significant, just enough to peak my interest. Had we not been in lockdown, I probably wouldn't have bought the workbook. I will be meeting a friend to go through a few of the exercises but without a group of people to work with, without the instruction or guidance of the writers, the workbook is really not of any value for me. It may prompt others, and maybe there is more on line but at this point in time, it is not a purchase I believe to be necessary.",
    "This workbook is lacking depth; not really “designing your life”",
    "Fast shipping and product as described.",
    "Was not useful to me, might be to someone else though.",
    "Gran complemento al libro. Absolutamente recomendado"

    "It had a sharp tear on the front cover",
    "this book provides a good overview gf the US HC system, incorporating key definitions to understand the different levels of service, care, financing and general health care professionals description.\nAt the time of publication, it was quickly anticipating the demise of the prevalent health care act without further analysis nor reasoning of why it was going to be repeled. Moreover, the authors do not address the ongoing challenges detractors of ACA had nor provides the reader with ideas of what the primary views were on what to replace with the ACA.\n\nThroughout the book, there is continuous criticisms of the prevalent system yet does not address the ongoing challenges of health care fraud nor those of the health care needs for veterans and minorities including ethnic groups.",
    "Ordered for a class. Realized quickly I wasn't going to need it and ended up returning it. However, it arrived in good condition and as described.",
    "Gonna use it for the semester and it’s good quality it came pretty fast",
    "I picked up this book after reading the Health Care Handbook and found that this has some very solid information, and left me feeling that I have a working knowledge of the US health care system. The reason for 4 stars is that the online materials accompanying this book are very lazy and not helpful. The comprehension quizzes are 10 questions of arbitrary importance, and the discussion questions are just open ended questions that don't have responses or answers anywhere to be found. I think if the authors supplemented this book with more quizzes and discussion questions it would provide a much better experience.",
    "As advertised. Book arrived in good condition. Appropriate packaging to reduce wear and tear during transit appreciated, among other things. Outstanding customer service. Would visit again for books. Thank you Alin & Becky.",
    "The book is up to date and quite useful for a graduate level class I am taking. The writing style is approachable but often quite dry.\nThere are often several pages of quite busy graphs or tables but not enough synthesis or discussion of all of that data.",
    "I rented this book and only used a handful of times due to pages being missing. I returned the rental before the due date to be notified that I was being charged for water damage. A complete rip off, as the book had no water damage to it and I wasn’t compensated for the pages being missing.",
    "This book was required for one of my classes !!!!"

    "This is my career Bible. I highly recommend this book if you like self-dev books to grow in your career.",
    "Good points for living inside and outside of an organization. Down to earth language. I recommend.",
    "Interesting and easy read. Pioints out things we often overlook. Recommend for leadership development to keep people from derailing themselves.",
    "I resonated with many interesting examples in this book – mainly, I read it from the point of view as an educated woman with an international background. I believe Goldsmith wrote this book with wholehearted honesty and hope for positive changes in people who \"think\" they are successful but feel like something is \"off\" and can't pin down the diagnosis. My takeaways are that 1) The \"aggressive\" and wanting to \"win\" behavior are quite common. That helps me not treat people's bad behavior personally. 2) Appreciate the advice of \"When you don't judge an idea, no one can argue with you.\" That is pure geniuses, 3) Practical advice is easy to understand but difficult to implement. For women executives out there, read \"How Women Rise\" by Marshall Goldsmith and Sally Helgesen.",
    "The skills and attributes that underpin a successful executive career are subtly different than those that will support a successful board career. This book was written for executives but the lessons apply to the boardroom. Possibly they apply even more in that environment. \"The higher you go, the more your problems are behavioural\" concludes Marshall Goldsmith after some twenty years of coaching senior executives in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nGoldsmith coaches people to make simple changes. These simple changes are difficult to make.\n\nHis message is delivered simple and straight. It is a difficult read because you recognise yourself in the examples of undesirable behaviours. Goldsmith cuts through the clutter with the simple advice that we all do all of these things from time to time; we only need to fix the behaviours that are holding us back.\n\nAs Goldsmith only deals with successful people he is working to fine-tune an already high performance. This is not a `self-help 1.01' book. It is for people who have become successful while exhibiting certain behaviours but who are now held back by those behaviours. It is hard to change behaviours that are associated with success. This book is not about a quick fix. It is about a long and consistent process that, if followed, will help to build new habits.\n\nBoard members struggle to gain entry to the coterie of successful directors. Choosing the right habits to build could accelerate acceptance. Choosing the wrong ones could leave you as you are; only more frustrated. The process relies on external feedback and validation to select the behaviours that need changing. This is daunting for board members given the confidential nature of boardrooms and the team-based nature of the role. Having a third party gather the feedback and qualify the participants to provide feedback makes this easier. If you don't have a professional coach to help you extract the value from this book you will need a trustworthy friend who understands boards and boardroom dynamics.\n\nThe book is a call to action. It is especially relevant for aspiring directors or those at the start of their career. It is also great for those sudden changes in board careers such as taking on a committee chairmanship or moving into a different sector. When you are new you need to be more adept at the behavioural skills to compensate for your lack of track record.\n\nIt would be exciting to apply this long process to the board performance review to build a lasting improvement in the quality of board interactions.\n\nThis is a worthwhile book; it is good but not easy.\n\n* Julie Garland McLellan is a professional non-executive director, board and governance consultant and mentor. She is the author of \"The Director's Dilemma\", \"All Above Board: Great Governance for the Government Sector\" and numerous articles on corporate strategy and governance.",
    "At the 2007 Vistage International Global Conference, Mr. Goldsmith presented a Keynote Speech which piqued my interest in his views on how successful people become even more successful. His book did not disappoint me.\n\nGoldsmith writes in a clear and conversational tone. I had the advantage of having heard his voice and so could \"hear him speaking\" in my head as I read through his material. From the beginning, he sets a no-nonsense tone about what it takes to evaluate where you are and what you need to do to \"get there\" - a presumably better place. Goldsmith relies heavily on 360 degree feedback from colleagues and direct reports when he is working with an executive. He encourages his readers to do the same and provides tools in the appendices to help in that regard.\n\nThe book is logically organized and hits all the leadership growth hot buttons: The trouble with success, The 20 habits that hold you back from the top, How we can change for the better and Pulling out the stops. And not to let things get too predictable, the 20 habits turn into 21 and the 21st habit that holds you back from the top is \"Goal Obsession.\"\n\nThe short list for \"how we can change for the better,\" is: Feedback, apologizing, telling the world of your discoveries, listening, thanking, following up and practicing feedforward (seeking ideas on how to improve the skill you pick to improve; such as asking a colleague for two ideas on \"how I can become a better listener.\"\n\nBesides being concise, well organized, and to the point, Goldsmith regales us with wonderful stories from his many years of coaching experience. It seems that there are at least a couple of \"nuggets\" in each chapter. For example, from the section on \"Be Your Own Press Secretary,\" there is this statement: \"If there's one thing we've learned in this noisy media age, it's that simple, un-nuanced messages break through the clutter and hit home with high impact. (I'm not saying that's always a good thing, but it's a fact of life. Deal with it.\" Another gem I enjoyed was; \"As a friend wisely noted, `Forgiveness means letting go of the hope for a better past.' \" And on Feedback, Goldsmith had this to say, \"It's not hard to see why people don't want to hear negative feedback. Successful people are incredibly delusional about their achievements. Over 95 percent of the members in most successful groups believe that they perform in the top half of their group.\"\n\nThis is a must read for any leader who is serious about advancing his or her own career and coaching others along that path. Get it, read it, do it.",
    "Good book, worth my time... But I'm not sure of it'll go on the re-read list. It's clearly written for a high level leader, for me some of it translates to my day-to-day but some didn't.\n\n4 stars is right",
    "Practical - will be easy to act upon. Insightful- useful case examples help you to understand lessons in real life. Fast read.",
    "I purchased this book after a senior vice president recommended it as a book to read. It's a great book, with lots of items to think about. I'm not sure if it hard core entrepreneurs would agree with some of the approaches in the book, as I believe working in a large corporate environment is slightly different to being a small medium sized ( business) entrepreneur. It's not a one shoe size fits all approach. However, some good takeaways for those in large corporate institution's. It would be interesting to get some entrepreneurial feedback on some of the concepts mentioned here.",
    "There's not much to object to in this book but it's all pretty basic advice. Worth a quick look but be prepared to be potentially disappointed if you are expecting great insights.\n\nThe core of the book is 20 things that you shouldn't do, such as (paraphrasing):\n- don't put down others too much to make yourself look good\n- don't take over other people's ideas\n- don't be too quick to judge others\n- don't make destructive comments\n- don't take the credit for others work (too much)\n- don't suppress innovation with Nos and Buts\n\nA lot of this comes down to treat your colleagues with respect and positivity.",
    "This book is introspective, proving and non judgemental. It forces you to address things to know, but don’t acknowledge. The part where he explains human nature of ‘replaying a showreel of our greatest moments’ cut deep. This book is one I’ll be recommending to my closest circle, and I’ll certainly be implementing the changes.\nBuy it; you need this book!",
    "The reviewer Birchall pretty much say what I think.\n\nI was recently hit from two directions by the same person. They said, \"You're the one person that stands out in my mind as someone who's never seemed to reach their full potential.\" And secondly, \"You are actually the worse listener I've ever met. You are dreadful!\" Ouch!\n\nI found those comments motivational and started to work on changing through using this book. The book is analysis and workshop methods you need. The methods are in the book are not always obvious and certainly not easy fix-ups. But I think having to work at finding the what's and how's better than just being given the routemap.\n\nI'd bet everyone has weak areas in their empathy with others and this book will tell you how to self diagnose and then how to start fixing the problems. You might find this book much more interesting (or horrifying) than you thought it would be. I started using the techniques with my wife - now that was interesting...\n\nOnce you are on the recovery route try \"Just Listen\"  Just Listen: Discover the Secret to Getting Through to Absolutely Anyone",
    "I wanted to say \"this book is awful, you'd never catch me doing that, I wouldn't dream of it...\"\n\nAnd if I did I would be lying. This book is powerful, and makes the strong case for 360 feedback- we all have our blind spots, and sometimes it is worth knowing what they are. Goldsmith knows his quarry, and our common flaws, very well.\n\nThis book makes the good point that most successful people get where they are on a mixture of ability and spin, and that may take them a long way up the corporate or professional ladder. Classically Western education has been about learning a subject, not about learning to understand yourself and your motivations. What the author adds is an appreciation that all virtues are shadowed by the vices of their excess and their lack. He shows how using 360 feedback on the basis that you don't know how you come across unless you've asked your co-workers and significant customers can help people develop further, increase their insight and their contribution to their work. The workers he assesses may well end up enjoying their work more, and getting promotions.\n\nThis book is well written, and it is on the great old theme of how we come to know ourselves accurately.\n\nI think it would help most people in business and in professions to progress further, and even better to do this with their own and their colleagues sanity and respect intact."

    "The back cover describes this book as 'the ultimate guide to mastering your mental strength...\n\nand claims ... 'new strategies that work for everyone..' it continues .\n\nBold claims - hold up - that's not fair on the consumer.\n\nThere is only so much you can say about a packet of instant soup on the label. In the end, it's just instant soup and it's nothing new and never can be.\n\nThis is a more of a book for the mentally fragile, not for those of us that are polishing our careers and making ourselves better.\n\nIt doesn't have anything 'new' as described and sadly the same old stuff is being said in yet another drawn out way to make us feel it's new.\n\nOn the positive side, the author I am sure, is a wonderful person and a talented therapist. Does not make them a good author or writer.\n\nIt's a laboured drawn out read at best and having read the whole thing, it's nothing like as good as other original classics in this market. Sorry I know that was harsh but it's the reality.\n\nDon't buy it if you are looking for something new.\n\nI'll be mastering my mental strength and by not buying more me-toos like this.",
    "I don't like writing negative reviews as I am quite open minded and we all have different perceptions of things. This book is really poor though. It's obvious and full of clichés. I'm amazed at the positive reviews. I managed to get halfway through but found it too painful to read the other half",
    "The chapter titles and concept for each chapter are good, however the actual content for each is extremely repetitive. The same thing being said over and over. Three of four case studies and scenarios to explain the same point is too much. Good ideas, poorly executed. 250+ pages which could have been contained in less than 100.",
    "This book has helped me a lot just through reading it. The author speaks very candidly about her mental strength development which is helpful. I also like how she talks about her faith in god. I myself am not a religious person but appreciate that her faith did not cloud the advice given in the book as is the case sometimes with the self-help genre. The techniques given here are common sense and relatively easy to follow in practice. She often reiterated that you won’t become perfect overnight (or ever) and I find that refreshing as many books offer too quick a fix. The only issue I had with the book was the use of studies throughout as I found them a little bit cherry picked but overall she used them to illustrate her point which is a good thing. I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their mental strength.",
    "When I read some of the negative reviews I was hesitant to get the book. In my opinion, I'm so glad I got the book. For anyone who wants to do better, live better, grow emotionally/mentally, be happier, find peace...whatever...this book reminds us all about what we logically know but don't always feel. Even better is that she points out that life isn't about perfection, it's about progression. We're human. We're flawed. Sometimes even when we know better we don't, because that's life. Life is about trying and persevering rather than perfection and succeeding all the time.\n\nThe book is great because she shows examples of how some of the undermining habits stem from some of the best of intentions, how subtle those habits can be and how insidious they are in affecting our lives. Then, she gives the light and the dark of each habit showing options to actively improve as well as gives examples of warning signs for thoughts/behaviour that can undermine the very goals we're striving towards.\n\nShe's not trivializing suffering or even minimizing individual struggle. What she is doing is showing that the suffering and the struggle cannot be controlled or avoided. It is as much a part of life as the joy and the success, and it happens to everyone. However, there are tools / habits that allow the processing of the experience to be beneficial and even empowering despite the experience being a challenge, a setback, a loss, etc..\n\nThis isn't a 'think positive' and it's all good kind of book. This is a book about actively assessing our thoughts and determining whether the thoughts empower or disempower/benefit or undermine. Using real life examples and personal experience the author allows the reader to relate and see that they're not alone. This is a book about working on improving by actively participating in life experiences while assessing how we view and think about the experience with an awareness of the thought processes that can enhance the experience for good or for bad.\n\nAt the end of the day, life is a matter of perspective. How we view our reality determines how we feel and how we react. For some, tragedy is a gift while for others tragedy is the end of the game. Get this book to gain resilience and insight. I'm getting additional copies as gifts to help those I love gain additional tools and insight that will empower them."

    "I had a problem I now see clearer thanks to this book - I tried to measure everything. Russ' gift with this book is to take familiar (to me - business undergrad, MBA, etc) business- and economics-style thinking and challenge some of the basic assumptions that everything can or needs to be measured and improved.\n\nThis book is readable by anyone. It touches on themes and experiences that everyone can relate to, regardless of culture, language, or country. And it READABLE! As in - the style is engaging, interesting and not overly complex or academic. Given the author's background, he needs to take a bow that he has managed to do what so many others in his field haven't been able to do: write like a normal human being instead of an academic.\n\nIt's okay to just be okay with life sometimes. It's okay to make decisions simply because they align with who I want to me, instead of trying to mentally go though the pro/con list. It's okay to find the joy and happiness in my existing marriage instead of always comparing it to some hypothetical \"optimized\" marriage.\n\nI've already recommended it to several people and lent my copy to a friend. Meaning, I'll probably need to purchase it again - and will be happy to do so and I won't even think of the marginal cost when I do ;)",
    "Perhaps Russ Roberts was feeling guilty that so many people took the insights of economists and used them to relentlessly try to optimize their lives with varying results. What we have with Wild Problems is a book based on the insights of one economist that attempts to do something better.\n\nI’ve been listening to Russ Roberts and EconTalk since 2008. He was my companion back then when I took the bus in Suzhou, China. Back then, I listened to him to learn about economics since I was in China and that was the topic on everyone’s lips. Without realizing it perhaps, I’ve been facing Wild Problems with Russ in my earbuds for 14 years: moves, career changes, getting married, becoming a parent. There is not much new in the book for faithful listeners like myself. Instead, I think of it as a reference to be pulled off of the shelf when I want to remember what Russ would have to say about something.\n\nI tried to learn about economics for 14 years and ended up with a life instead. In case you’re still reading, buy this book. Thanks Russ.",
    "The book is essentially an extended meditation on big decisions that don't easily lend themselves to narrow cost benefit analysis, such as who to marry, what career to choose, and whether to have children.\nRoberts ties it into basic questions of meaning, ethics, and happiness (Roberts prefers the broader term \"flourishing\", for reasons discussed in the book.)\nThe book extensively illustrates from and draws on personal anecdotes and experience, as well as a wide variety of others.\nIt has a distinctly simple, folksy and intuitive style.\nAlthough I enjoyed the book, I didn't find it to have a significant number of non-intuitive insights. (Other than the one major insight that life-defining decisions are qualitatively different from other types of decisions, because you will become a different person depending on the option you choose.) On all the topics discussed, there are other books with more non-intuitive, nuanced, insights, especially that of Dan Gilbert (mentioned a number of times in the book).\nIn addition, although the book is explicitly more modern, the general thrust of the book is fairly traditional. As a materialist whose thinking and worldview is deeply informed by evolutionary psychology, I often found it difficult to connect to what appears to be a fundamentally traditional/conservative perspective of the author.",
    "For a regular listener to his Econtalk podcast, this is a beautiful expansion on themes that Russ has covered over the last ~5 years. This book is incredibly readable, short (a plus!), and packed with insights. Great reading for anyone asking themselves \"what is the good life\" or any number of wild problems that don't lend themselves to traditional rational analysis. A great read - will buy copies for friends and family.",
    "In a sentence: Wild problems can't be 'solved' by calculus, decide what to DO based on who you aspire to BE.\n\nThis is a fantastic book, approachable and tactical advice about the hard decisions in life. I strongly recommend it. Russ alludes to some deep philosophical ideas but stays very topical in his treatment of the ideas. I think anyone regardless of their background can read, relate to, and benefit from this book. Read it. Job well done.",
    "Economics? Philosophy? Self Help? Novels?\n\nRuss wrote another great book more on \"how\" to think than \"what\" to think (which really seems like the overarching theme of the last few years of EconTalk). I really enjoyed it, very quick read. If you like deep questions, you'll like this. And if you like this, you'll like anything by Russ Roberts.",
    "Some of the points that Russ Roberts made seemed so obvious that at first blush they were hardly worth mentioning. Obvious, that is, once I’d read them. Different from the way I thought and better. I liked it enough that I read it twice.",
    "This book offered a lot of wisdom. It was a quick read and has a lot of valuable insights. I would recommend it to a friend. Thanks for writing!"

    "Love it",
    "Really goes in depth to grow your relationship and how you see your partner.",
    "Like the book",
    "I really liked this book and its sister book, ‘leadership and self-deception’ - definitely a great mindset is suggested.",
    "This is one of the best books I have ever read. Some books I read are entertaining, some are inspiring, some are educational, and some are life changing. This book has been life changing for me. I have purchased several copies that I have given as Christmas presents and plan to give some as wedding gifts as well.\n\nSome of my favorite quotes are:\n\n\"We can treat our children fairly but if our hearts are warring toward them while we’re doing it, they won’t think they’re being treated fairly at all....As important as behavior is most problems at home, at work, and in the world are not failures of strategy but failures of way of being.\"\n\n\"We first need to find our way out of the internal wars that are poisoning our thoughts, feelings, and attitudes toward others. If we can’t put an end to the violence within us, there is no hope for putting an end to the violence without.\"\n\n\"And we have seen how one warring heart invites more \"object seeing\" and warring in others.\"....\"No one can force a warring heart upon us. When our hearts go to war, we ourselves have chosen it.\"\n\n\"Because when I betray myself I create within myself a new need-a need that causes me to see others accusingly, a need that causes me to care about something other than truth and solutions, and a need that invites others to do the same in response.\"\n\n\"As painful as it is to receive contempt from another, it is more debilitating by far to be filled with contempt for another.\"\n\n\"A heart at war needs enemies to justify its warring. It needs enemies and mistreatment more than it wants peace.\"\n\n\"Whenever we need to be justified, anything that will give us justification will immediately take on exaggerated importance in our life. Self betrayal corrupts everything-even the value we place on things.\"\n\n\"the more sure I am that I’m right, the more likely I will actually be mistaken. My need to be right makes it more likely that I will be wrong! Likewise, the more sure I am that I am mistreated, the more likely I am to miss ways that I am mistreating others myself.\"\n\n\"Difficult people are nevertheless people, and it always remains in my power to see them that way.\"\n\n\"Everyone I hated was always with me, even when I was alone. They had to be, for I had to remember what and why I hated in order to remind myself to stay away from them.\"\n\n\"It isn’t so much what you did as what you invited.\"\n\n\"Because most who are trying to put an end to injustice only think of the injustices they believe they themselves have suffered. Which means that they are concerned not really with injustice but with themselves. They hide their focus on themselves behind the righteousness of their outward cause.\"\n\n\"It is not the sense of what to do but the desire to do it that’s at issue...When we have recovered those sensibilities towards others, we must act on them.\"\n\n\"You have the biggest influence in your children’s lives, so if we want to be a positive influence with your children we better have strong relationships with you.\"\n\n\"If we don’t get our hearts right, our strategies won’t matter. Once we get our hearts right, however, outward strategies matter a lot.\"\n\n\"Our passions, beliefs, and needs do not divide but unite: it is by virtue of our own passions, beliefs, and needs that we can see and understand others’. If we have beliefs we cherish, then we know how important others’ beliefs must be to them.\"",
    "I do not like story-form non-fiction, generally speaking, and this one was just as contrived as the others (Think The Goal, The Phoenix Project, The One Minute Manager, etc. However, the content is good.",
    "I love books written in story form that teach and change the way we look at the world. This is such a book. I love that you got to experience the change of heart of each person in the story and that your own heart is changed. I am trying to change the way I feel about myself and others and too look at everyone with love. I have a long road but I really feel this book has helped open a door.\nMy absolute favorite quote from the book is \" Acts of self -betrayal such as those I've mentioned are so common they are almost ho-hum. But when we dig a little deeper, we discover something fascinating about self-betrayal\". He looked around at the group.\" A choice to betray myself\". he said \"is a choice to go to war\".\nI have learned that my heart has been at war for a long time, with myself mostly so it reaches out to all around me. It stops us from seeing people as human and they become objects or other negative things. I like to remind myself that everyone is my bother or sister and we are all connected. Would I yell at my brother if I didn't get my way at a restaurant, I wouldn't, but if you look at that waiter as an object not giving you what you want you might yell. Not because you are a jerk but because your heart is at war and you don't know another way. I loved the justification boxes and will be studying those for a while I don't want to fall back into those boxes.\nThis was an awesome book and now I add to my prayers that my heart be a heart of peace not war.\nIf you liked this book you might like Zero Limits and Remembering Wholeness and You can Heal Your life.",

    "(This is the same review that I posted on Audible dot com):\nI purchased the hard cover and listened to the narration on Audible, while reading along in the book. If it were not for the excellent narration of Kiff VandenHeuval, I would have dropped reading the book. It can get tedious. That said, VandenHeuval really brings it to life, so I “hung-in-there”.\n\nSynopsis (Lots of “spoilers” here):\n\nDrug companies, large and small (Actavis, Victor Borelli, Cephalon, Endo, Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt, Purdue, Burt Rosen, Teva, and Watson Labs), their distributors (AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Harvard Drug, H.D. Smith, Masters Pharmaceutical, McKesson, and Sunrise Wholesale) sell massive amounts of OxyContin and oxycodone through retailers (CVS Health, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Walmart pharmacies). In turn, these myriad pharmacies fill thousands of dubious prescriptions, overwhelmingly written by unscrupulous physicians or “pill mills”. The profits for everyone in the chain, the “cartel”, are enormous. Thousands of Americans die, especially in the Ohio River Valley, West Virginia, and Florida (where distribution laws are particularly lax).\n\nA dedicated DEA agent, Joe Rannazzisi, makes it his personal project (along with a team of DEA agents) to stop the carnage and blatant abuses of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, through their lobbyists and a few well-placed campaign donations, the drug companies (likened to a “cartel”) enlist congressman Tom Marino (R, Pennsylvania) and U.S. Senator, Marsha Blackburn, (R, Tennessee) to draw the Marino-Blackburn Bill (S.483), which --- through some strategically-placed sleight-of-hand and tactical language editing of existing legislation --- manages to emasculate one of the most powerful tools that the DEA has in order to keep the manufacturers and distributors (the “cartel”) in line: Immediate Suspension Orders (ISOs). Without the ISO, Rannazzisi is powerless, the pills keep on shipping, and more Americans die.\n\nThought to be just routine, Congress pays little attention to the revised language within S.483; it passes without discussion and opposition. Unwittingly, Obama signs it into law.\n\nRannazzisi is discredited and is forced into early retirement. The years of stress catch up with him and he has a triple bypass shortly after.\n\nTime passes. Thousands more die from overdoses, with little DEA interference. Hundreds of lawsuits are filed. The plaintiffs, which have grown to more than 4,000 --- cities, counties, native American tribes --- form an MDL (Multidistrict litigation, which consolidates complex cases, so they're managed by one court.) The judge desperately wants the parties to settle. They don’t. They go to trial.\n\nThe “cartel” hires big gun law firms to defend themselves from prosecution and any liability. Some cities and counties decided to split-off from the MDL, believing they can get better settlements on their own, others do not. Joe Rannazzisi becomes an “expert witness” in many of the cases and gets a second life out of it, so to speak.\n\nThe plaintiffs hire a big gun trial lawyer from Texas, Mark Lanier. Some cases are won, some are lost. ($40 billion in settlements, so far). The MDL is still pending and the book ends before we know the outcome of one of the West Virginia cases, which is litigated by an attorney, Paul Farrell, from West Virginia, who has seen the devastation firsthand. The case is held in the court of a Federal Judge, David A. Faber. (Later, the Judge decides in favor of the distributors.)\n\nNOT ONE corporate CEO has been prosecuted. It so often gets down to “How much Justice can you afford?” What’s new in America, eh?\n\nAmerican Cartel almost reads like a movie script --- you know, behind-the-scenes investigations, court drama, and a lot of dialog --- otherwise I can't figure-out why it was written. The authors' entire story has already published in the Washington Post. I just got the feeling the authors had tons of extra material laying around, and decided to plop it into a book. Or, maybe every investigative reporter at the Post is a Woodward or Bernstein wannabe.\n\nI’d certainly recommend this book and I’d argue that Audible is the way to go; the narration is that good.\n\nThere was an HBO documentary on the subject:\n(I don't have HBO --- I'd really like to see this.)\n\nPS: Just in the past few days some nationwide pharmacies have been held liable.",
    "The book is extremely well written and takes you behind the scenes of the people and companies involved in creating the Opioid epidemic in America. It is a tragic story of greed that these company leaders and employees valued money more than human life. Scott and Sari's investigate reporting is steller. Not only identifying each character but giving their background and showing they are real people and what drove them to do what they did or didn't do.\nGreat reporting on how American businesses discard human beings lives for wealth.",
    "Knowing the pain of losing a son to this crisis, I've read most books on the subject to try to make sense of it. This one differs in two main ways: 1) It takes a broader look at who caused the problem with a fous on the distributors' role; 2) It describes not just the villains, but also the heroes who tried to save us from them. I had heard of Joe Rannazzisi and had viewed the despicable behavior of Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn when she questioned him during hearings. It was good to learn the background. Joe tried to save my son and the children of over a million other parents, and I thank him for that. Tragically, powerful, corrupt people won. Millions suffered unspeakable pain to make a few dozen villains rich.",
    "Good examination of immoral drug industries huge profits from the numerous deaths and economic damage they have caused by flooding the nation with addictive drugs . The courts rejection on July12th of Cabell County and the City of Huntington's case against the drug companies must lead to a substantial revision of the inadequate federal laws that the drug industry have paid to cripple . Don't the Senators and Congressman from West Virginia think their state has suffered enough ?",
    "Higham and Horwitz have done a great job here of outlining the history of the opioid crisis, the pharmaceutical and retail industries’ culpability, the role of our elected officials, and the impact on families across the country. In conjunction with reading this book, I encourage you to check out “Crime of the Century”, a two-part documentary on the topic that includes Higham. Kudos to the team at the Washington Post for the research, tenacity, and doing what they can to bring the crisis the attention it deserves.",
    "Amazing writing gives the reader a very clear picture of the pharmaceutical companies role as mafia organizations concerned only with power and money. Great read.",
    "Front-line reporting\nTrial excerpts and transcripts\nExposes governmental hypocrisy\nCogent explanation of opiod crisis\nRich poor dichotomy\nWhite collar executives get fined\nPoor people go to jail\nLawyers get rich",
    "As someone who was involved in the story, I found the book to be a very accurate description of DEAs efforts in the cases outlined. It describes vividly the successes and frustrations we felt, and the personal toll felt by Joe and others. I was fascinated when reading about the interaction between attorneys in the MDL. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to know the depth at which these companies damaged the country to read this book. It is a definitive story of the corruption and greed displayed by big Pharma during the opioid epidemic.",
    "Back in late 2016 I read a series in the Washington Post about the opioid trade. When I saw it had been made into a full length book and updated to early 2022 I had to get it. That was a very good decision. This book will take you into a deep dive on the opioid industry and you will come away agreeing that the people who run this industry are drug dealers in suits. You'll not regret buying it."

The same happens during the course of the book. Stories about babysitters becoming managers for her or tips like check on people you fired after some time, are rather disturbing. The bonus chapter does not add anything to the content. In a nutshell this book could be 50-100 pages and not 400.",

    "I absolutely love this book. Yes... I mean it in the present. I keep it on my desk to reread portions every week because it is that good a book. I have heard it read to me by the authors no less than 3 times and reread it in written form twice.\n\nWhy you may wonder? It is an utter delight (and so uncommon) to hear someone talk of communication as a responsibility of all parties involved. Those that receive feedback must have a framework to interpret feedback given (no matter whether it is done well or poorly by the provider) and this book aids the reader in identifying their own assumptions leading into a review process. It takes some of the pressure off both sides of the equation.\n\nFor the receiver of feedback, embracing the realism and hope that this book projects from cover to cover is LIFE CHANGING. I am speaking from personal experience as this book changed my life. This book's effect was not only in my giving and receiving professional feedback but also for my personal life. As an example, I have lost 65 lbs when I applied lessons from this text to my personal life.\n\nI personally enjoyed the audio book version even more as the authors offer through their tone and speech even greater insight. I bought the written version to review favorite passages.\n\nThis book (in audio form) after a particularly difficult feedback session that could have destroyed my sense of self and professionalism, probably saved my life. It gave me a lens to interpret what had happened. This book offered a framework to understand why the feedback was so painful and, at the same time, so UTTERLY USELESS despite the givers' best intent. Because of the authority with which these authors write, I was able to take back the power to make sense of the feedback that was offered as I lost my job as a spiritual leader. The feedback didn't have to be what others said should be, think an indictment of personal and professional worthlessness. I was no longer a limited to what they insisted it should be (because that is what they wanted it to be) but instead given the power to use what was offered in helpful ways based on the reframing this book provided. I was able to develop and be a better human instead of being destroyed by the feedback I had received.\n\nTo the authors... Thank you Stone and Heen... please know that you changed my life.",
    "-Easy to read it.\n-Many real-life examples and this is very helpful in order to understand how to manage your conversations.",
    "I like to think of myself as pretty good at communication. I've read a number of communication books, practiced it at work, and even held mediations. But this book taught me so much—about communication and about myself. Do you get sensitive and upset when people critique you? Do you wish you didn't? And would you like communicating at work and at home to be like 10x's easier? The other thing that's really great about this book is, for every concept introduced, there's a bunch of easy examples. Whether you know a lot about communication or not, this book has something to teach you.",
    "ok this book is INCREDIBLE. I started reading it because I know that I (like most everyone in the world) could be better at receiving feedback and understanding where people are coming from. I did not expect to have an entire perspective change... this book isn't only about feedback, it's about life and relationships in general. I think every single person should read this book... it's convicting and confronting with revealing the way we respond to feedback, why we respond the ways we do, and how we develop feedback for others. It touches on the importance of clarity, curiosity, asking questions and getting to the root of things instead of assuming or reacting (because we usually cannot see the whole picture!).\n\nI think every leader, team, student, athlete, parent, spouse, and literally anyone and everyone should read this book because it's incredible, eye opening and will be so helpful to your personal growth!",
    "I learned a lot and it was very helpful, insightful and gave great specific information. I highly recommend reading it!",
    "This book was recommended by a friend. It has been very beneficial in my conversations at work, with my husband, with my friends, and my family. I highly recommend this for anyone wants to know a little more about how their brain is wired and why they react to things in a certain way. I think the most beneficial thing I have learned is to give yourself a second score.",
    "This book is FULL of great information, helpful examples, humor, and practical things to try. The authors obviously have done their research and learned from their experiences. I'm using this information to build out a course on receiving and giving feedback. It's just one of my resources, but page for page it has more value than some of the other books and articles. I have 5 books on feedback and have read too many HBR.org and MindTools.com articles to count. All of the other books were good too, but this one does stand apart because if focuses first on being able to seek feedback in different ways and places a large emphasis on receiving it. We have always focused on how to deliver feedback, but the authors are correct when they say all the control is really in the receivers hands. Switching the focus from giving to receiving could have more wide spread impact in our organization because we all get feedback but many of us don't have a lot of opportunity to give effective feedback.Also, we like to focus our training courses on things that the participants are in control of. We can't control how the feedback is delivered to us, but we can change how we receive it.",
    "When I started reading this book I thought - OK, so there's something I can do to get better at receiving feedback....but it's not just about MY reaction / learning. But as I read on, I realised that if I could change the way I received feedback, then if would be in a much better position to help others to learn this too. I can see the wisdom in working through yourself first, before you can work with others. I especially valued the points made on the emotional reactions to feedback that so often get in the way (but it makes no sense to pretend that these emotions do not exist). I could cite many other key points - suffice to say that this well-researched book has a great deal of useful teaching....set out in a very logical way, with useful examples and clear explanations. Very well worth reading...especially by managers or leaders ( though anyone can benefit, as the advice applies just as well to relationships).",
    "Great book on understanding feedback so you can also give it. By the same authors as Difficult Conversations.",
    "Great presentation and analysis of the problem and clear road-map more providing a solution - every educator and everyone who has felt upset by criticism should read it. I was reminded of the sentence from the Sermon on the mount, Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness\" and reworked as ,\"Happy are those who hunger and thirst for being put right!\"",
    "Very helpful",
    "A superb book. Well structured, original thinking, good use if stories and very very relevant. Very highly recommended."

    "I have always been an individualist type of person and was always suspicious of the motives of those who seek power. This is why I never trusted politicians, attorneys, and other dictators within a society. After reading this book I now realize my suspicious were true. One has to be a dishonest, cunning, and ruthless psychopathic type of person to follow most of these principles. No matter how noble these type of people may appear to the gullible, it is all just a phony mask hiding their true nature, which is a dictator in disguise. This is also why I refer to all politicians (but it mostly applies to all far left collectivists type politicians) as \"dictators in disguise\" in my book, \"Never Trust a Politician.\"\n\nI admit a very small number of these \"The concise 48 laws of power\" by Robert Greene may be positive advice for life's battles such as master the art of timing, despise the free lunch, never appear too perfect, win through your actions, never through argument, avoid the unhappy and unlucky, keep your hands clean, and assume formlessness. However, the vast majority of these laws are designed for those people who are unethical and have no qualms about screwing over anyone to gain power. These are not good honest people, but more like depraved thugs. Many of these so-called laws are what organized crime mobsters live by in their depraved lifestyle. Some of the 48 laws in this manual includes the following:\n\nNever put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies, Conceal your intentions. Court attention at all costs. Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit, learn to keep people dependent on you (The far left politicians and Union leaders follow this law to the letter). Pose as a friend , work as a spy. Play on people's need to believe to create a cult like following and finally \"Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.\"\n\nThis is a book not just for those who seek power, but it is also a very important text for anyone who desires to understand the personality and underlying psychological factors of those who seek power. This is a play book Hitler, Mao, Putin and every other dictator in history probably followed to get their power.\n\nRating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Never Trust a Politician: A critical review of politics and politicians)",
    "I felt a bit icky much of the time that I read this book. Nearly all of the entries assume malicious intent. But there were a few that can be applied without malice (e.g. don't say more than you need to) in leadership settings at work. Whenever there is a group, politics is at play regardless of whether we admit it. Some of the other entries can be useful to know so that they can be defended against. Adapting all of these rules would, I'm sure, get you executed in the modern sense. Though many of them ring true. Some of them feel a bit esoteric and far-fatched even for defense because they presume no morals whatsoever which is the case with sociopaths only. A more tempered version that doesn't make you feel ashamed when reading it would probably have been better. But part of the book's power is how provocative it is - you're shocked but you can't look away. I also wonder what goes on in the minds of some politicians, for example, who appear to have no ethics at all. And I suspect this book offers a glimpse. I did notice that many quotes come from Machiavelli (who I've read) and Thracian (who I have not). I think I will give Thracian a read. Most others come from military contexts (e.g. Sun Tsu) which I consider to be a poor analogy for most of life's struggles.",

    "Wanna learn how to have the upper hand? Pick this book.",
    "If you're a \"do what you love and the money will follow\" enthusiast, this book will turn your stomach.\n\nIf you're ready to do anything at all, even compromising your values (if you have any) to get ahead, this book is what you're looking for. Waste no time clicking the button to buy this. It's easily one of the very best books for getting ahead in business.\n\nYes, the print is tiny. That's okay if you want to keep this in a jacket pocket, backpack, attache, or hidden in your desk or locker. In fact, the size of this book makes it ideal for anyone who'll want to refer to it regularly throughout the day... without co-workers noticing. (The red cover wasn't an ideal choice, but you can always cover it with an old-school book cover.)\n\nSure, if you have scruples, the advice in this book is appalling. Things like not letting your boss know how bright and clever you really are... so you're not perceived as a threat to his (or her) job, until it's too late for your boss to do anything about it.\n\nThat is the tip of the iceberg. In fact, the author opens with that kind of advice, building up to more devious tactics.\n\nIf you're looking for the very best, tried-and-true Machiavellian ways to lie, cheat, and (maybe) steal your way to the top -- and you didn't learn enough from Othello's Iago -- this is the book you want. It's loaded with tips, background information, and pithy quotations so you'll feel like these are venerable business practices.\n\n(I could counter that by saying -- in true hippie style -- two things: 1) Karma!, and 2) What goes around, comes around, so watch your back if you rise to the top following the advice in this book.)\n\nFor many of us who wouldn't think about doing half of what's in this book, it's kind of stomach-turning. Yes, we know we may lose opportunities to people who play by the rules (or lack of them) in this book. It's okay. We'll sleep better at night.\n\nIf you're laughing as you read this, thinking, \"That poor, deluded, excessively idealistic woman...,\" you will love every morsel of advice in this book. In fact, buy two copies, because you'll wear out the pages of the first copy.\n\nMe...? I'm keeping this book as a writing reference. When I need a sleazy character, or someone who will reform in the course of my story, this is an ideal guide to understand his characters and the things he might do, on his way to redemption.",
    "I’d say this book definitely falls out of the ‘self-help’ category and more into the self- destruction category. It’s so ridiculous that I couldn’t help but think it was some secret manual made to train a CartoonNetwork Supervillain\n\nI think the 48 Laws of Power appeals probably because the idea of a concise manual on how to garner more power feels like a quick and wise way of developing leadership qualities, but when you read it becomes very apparent that if you apply the vast majority of these issues into you’re real life… you’re probably going to lose all your friends, make a large amount of enemies and get fired. It encourages manipulation, malicious thinking and essentially how to be a back-stabbing snake. One example of this which actually made me laugh when I read it was the seventh law which stated ‘Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit’. It goes without saying that if you consistently do that, you’re not gonna last long in whatever job it is you’re doing regardless of how you twist that meaning. This is just a snapshot into the delusional things this author thinks are ideal in developing a powerful character, but there are 47 more laws, albeit, not all of them are entirely stupid, but most of them are which is why I would strongly advise against buying the book.\n\nAll in all, this book is written for a very specific type of immoral person that has little regard for people nor the well-being of their friends or family. If you are a normal human who wishes to encompass some new sterner and stronger qualities into your character that will help you muster more respect or more authority in the work place, then consider buying a book written by an actual psychologist who understands these sort of things because they’ll likely give you a more moralistic take that won’t fill your head with harmful nonsense.",

    "Bought the concise version by accident but is good for those who prefer something smaller. I have bought the full version as well, so will see the differences soon.",
    "I believe we live in two worlds; the inner and the outer world. I also believe that whichever religious book you believe in is the book for your inner world. But the 48 Laws of Power is most definitely the book for the outer world and should also be read religiously.",
    "The concise version is a bit too concise, missed out some of the best stories, gets to the point but I think they could have picked a much more interesting variation from the complete version"

    "Discovering the contents of this book has been life changing! I’m into learning why we think the way we think and how this translates to our interactions with others. Discovering we all have saboteurs that hijack our thinking on a consistent basis was revelatory! I am a Mindset and Confidence Coach and having this resource in my library is game changing! Even if you aren’t someone who’s profession has them working closely with individuals seeking a mindset, this book can help everyone understand why they think the way they do, what is causing them to have low confidence and it provides the tools to improve. Excellent read!",
    "I am a consummate reader — this is life-changing as it helped me to really see what has been holding me back from my greater self. Data driven and heart inspired, I’ve been practicing PQ now for over 6 months and have been living differently because of it. It is now at the heart of my coaching practice and has made everything I do— even better. It is a powerful practice.",
    "I highly recommend Positive Intelligence (book and 6-week program). Here’s why…\n\nI hold a Master's in Mental Health Counseling and am an ICF Certified Coach. I’ve lost count of the number of programs, approaches, books, workshops, etc. that I’ve experienced…and I can honestly say Shirzad’s Positive Intelligence (PQ) model is the simplest yet most powerful approach to personal and professional development. The reason is that he gets to the root cause through factor analysis (factor analysis is a technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors). For example, all colors are created from the three primary colors, right. So Shirzad has used top learnings and discoveries from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, positive psychology, and performance science to synthesize the essence of our core operating system (only 10 factors are responsible for our self-sabotage and 5 core powers that create peak performance and happiness). Think of our brain as the hardware and Positive Intelligence is an upgrade to our operating system – so that every application we run works better.\n\nYou may have heard this before:\nAn old Cherokee Indian chief was teaching his grandson about life.\nHe said, \"A fight is going on inside me,\" he told the young boy, \"a fight between two wolves.\nThe Dark one is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.\" He continued, \"The Light Wolf is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you grandson…and inside of every other person on the face of this earth.”\n\nThe grandson ponders this for a moment and then asked, \"Grandfather, which wolf will win?\"\n\nThe old Cherokee smiled and simply said, \"The one you feed\".\n\nThis is a great example of the two areas of the brain Shirzad focuses on the Sage area (light wolf) and the Saboteur area (dark wolf). We all have both “wolves” in our brains because we all essentially have the same “hardware” in the brain. What Positive Intelligence does is train our brain to “feed” the light wolf, while recognizing that while we can’t eliminate the dark wolf, we can learn to work with it differently.\n\nThe way we “feed” the Sage in our brain is by intercepting the saboteurs, building up our self-command muscle, and use one of the 5 core sage powers.\n\nMy favorite part is that we can change our brain in just short 2-minute practices called PQ reps (sort of like mini-mindful moments based on using one of our senses). I do PQ reps while driving, in meetings, before big presentations, with my kids, anytime! For a technical explanation, the PQ rep is activating our parasympathetic nervous system (the rest and digest system) while calming our sympathetic nervous system (the fight and flight system). This balancing of the nervous system promotes greater health, improved immune functions, feelings of relaxation, clearer focus, just to name a few.\n\nIn short, this book changed my life by calming my saboteurs and activating my sage. It closed the gap between my knowing what I need to do to actually doing it.",
    "This is a fresh interpretation of the demons who lurk inside our heads, and a practical method for making them shut the hell up.\n\n- Dr. Miles White, author of \"From Jim Crow to Jay-Z: Race, Rap and the Performance of Masculinity.\"",
    "Not necessary",
    "This has helped me tremendously! I can tell when I slack off for even a little bit, my depression & negative attitude show back up, but when I practice my PQ reps, my mind is more focused & I am more positive.",
    "The book and the content are simply put, not too much overwhelming scientific information but enough to explain what is behind the PQ idea.",
    "A very good book, easy to read. It does what it says it does and it does it well, while remaining easily accessible and, most of all, fun to read. I really enjoyed myself reading it.\nI hesitated a bit to buy it after reading some of the bad reviews, but after reading it I can only believe that these reviewers did not read it to the end. So here is my (Hyper-)rational meaning about it:\n\nWhat it does for you:\n\n- it shows you by which mechanisms your brain tries to protect itself even when it is not necessary, as a result limiting you both in your work and in your everyday life.\n- it gives you easy, quick and fun techniques to help you reverse that tendency, by getting more conscious of these defense mechanisms. That way they can still defend you when necessary, but they don't get in the way when you need to move forward.\n- it opens a window to your \"feelings\" in a no \"touchy-feely\" approach. Even if you are a very down to earth kind of person (which I am), you should not feel uncomfortable there.\n- it explains you the fundamentals of the science behind these techniques, and it gives you the references of the books and researches it is based on. That way you do not need to get a Masters degree in cognitive sciences to benefit from this book (but you can get started if you want :).\n\nWhat it does not do for you:\n\n- as already mentioned, it is not a complete science compendium. Do not expect hardcore science. Indeed, the author is quite clear as to when his words are the standard in the fields, and to when he is using his own words to summarize something more complex (and then he gives you the references you need to get more details if you want). NOTE: this aspect was at the core of all the bad reviews I read about this book. The tone was like\n> \"it just says the same usual stuff, just with other words\". Yes and I loved it. Because that way it speaks my language and the whole thing makes much more sense that a very complex scientific language or a hippie flower power approach (no judgement there, it is not just my preference)\n> \"this or that book explains all that so much better and in more details\". True, and the author explicitly explains that it was on purpose he kept it simple. Several of these books that are so much better are indeed referred to, and their contribution acknowledged.\n> \"he's just trying to sell books\". Of course he wants to sell books. He's obviously good at what he does so why should he not make money with it?\n> \"it's not a book about work environment, it is a book on self-improvement\". Well it is both. It can be useful on a strictly personal level, but almost all examples are work related. Even the ones on a personal level becomes personal only after deviating from an originally professional situation. Indeed if you only want a self-improvement book, you may find that it sounds too professional (seems that we are never happy anyways? What a coincidence! it's precisely what the book is about :-)\n\n- it does not go into deep psychological analyses of the feelings it mentions. The feelings involved are described in just enough details to understand the process, to relate to the description (see warning bellow) and to be able to practice the proposed technique.\n- it does not condemn you to a hard and long process if you want to follow its advice. Indeed, you will probably find out that if you just follow your usual habits with a bit more attention to what you are doing, you are already practicing the proposed techniques.\n- it does not solve the problem (if you have one) for you either. Just reading the book passively out of curiosity will sure teach you something, but it won't change your life. Reading actively is still necessary.\n\nNow a warning:\n\nyou will probably feel that the book was written just for you. I am generally quite active, confident, and in touch with my feelings, good or bad, without letting them paralyze me or blind me (okay: not too much). My score to the positive intelligence test before reading the book was not bad at all, although still with room for improvement. Still many of the examples of \"bad\" reactions to the environment sounded terribly familiar. And I mean: terribly familiar, some examples could have been written about me!! My point it, I would bet you will feel the same. So read it with an open mind, when you feel he's talking about you embrace it, play with it, and turn it into your advantage. You never get too many of these.",
    "I enjoyed the book, as a lover of psychology books I suspended my thoughts for the duration and can say that there is some golden nuggets within.\nThe book is indeed a little cliche and has some basic ideas, my response to that is sometimes you just need to see the same through a fresh perspective.\nAfter having been introduced to the online assessment I was eager to learn more. The book being a natural extension of the assessment. It is not as scientific or thorough but does give you hope for self and others.\nI definitely am able to separate my saboteurs now from my thinking and for that alone am grateful. I am also trying to trial the PQ reps approach and there is some benefit from that. The sage approach was something I was connected to in my past and I find I want to find that part of me again without the layers of judgemental or critical saboteurs. It’s a work in progress.\nThe one star deduction is finding that Shiraz, from his business background wants to turn this into a ongoing money making machine and his website encourages an expensive program , but then following that a limited duration to resources. This is sad as I initially felt there was an altruistic motivation here but this approach to milk a business from repeat sales based on this idea is a little disheartening. I accept he has to live and provide for his family. Also he may have charged more to clients when providing consulting before, but if he was really altruistic he would make the material more accessible. This is only a little reflection on the book itself, which I would still recommend.",
    "I heard about saboteurs on the Squiggly Careers podcast, and got the book to read more about them. If you are interested in self development, in nailing what may be stopping you from hitting your heights and in getting the best from your team, you may find value in the ideas in this book. The book references the author's website a few times and some links seem to have moved from where he describes them, but I was able to find the material. My own PQ score came out pretty high but it's something I can keep an eye on, and will definitely be watching out for my saboteurs.",
    "This is the book I needed. After decades of suffering I am finally free. It teaches you about your internal saboteurs and how to defeat them and it's surprisingly effortless.",
    "This is a really fantastic book if you are looking to reframe your mindset and make positive changes to become a better leader, colleague, and person by finding a way to take control of those inner demons! Highly recommend!!",
    "Love the books so much and now studying to be a certified coach in this area"

    "I had high hopes for this book and planned to use it in a graduate class for preservice teachers. After reading Chapter 2 there is absolutely no way I would make this required reading. Throughout they chapter they note at least three times that there is no research to back up the use of their strategies. The authors claim that dyslexia is a failure to integrate multiple modalities when learning to read. That is not accurate!! Reading difficulties are the result of problems with phonological processing. Full stop. See Dahaene, Kilpatrick, Shaywitz, Moats, and countless others for actual research on the causes of dyslexia and reading problems. This book is based on “hopeful research” and not based in science. I’m baffled as to why it is so well regarded.",
    "A comprehensive book that covers everything literacy related with up-to-date and relevant chapters based on current reading science and research.\n\nThis book is ESSENTIAL for literacy educators! It has everything and more! I delayed buying because of the price but now wish I had bought it sooner. It likely would have saved me money as in the meantime I bought many other books when I could have gotten all the info right here. I wish this had been my textbook during university.\n\nEach chapter is written by well-respected leaders in the literacy world and up to date with current Science of Reading research. This book is so research-based - in fact - at the end of each chapter, there are few pages of resources and references behind the info in the chapter.\n\nDefinitely get the 4th edition. The authors indicate that there are quite a few changes and additions based on SOR research and this edition is much more in line with Structured Literacy than previous editions.\n\nChapters cover: multisensory teaching, structured literacy, pre-reading, alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, beginning reading, executive function, decoding, spelling, handwriting, fluency, advanced reading, vocabulary, comprehension, writing and composition, dual language learners, older students, dyslexia, etc. It literally covers it all! Readers are provided the research and information but also given practical teaching methods and activity suggestions.\n\nThe book is very thick and written like a textbook, but the information and writing style is not dry and boring. Since each chapter relates to a specific literacy skill it can be read cover to cover, or just flip to a chapter that interests you.",

    "Okay, you've got to understand: I'm no fan of \"woo\" or new-agey alternative medicine, and this book is not that. I'm a diehard empiricist. Even so, what I'm going to tell you might sound weird.\n\nEveryone, EVERYONE, who has had long-term back pain needs to read this book and try it out.\n\nI had a back injury in 1993. It hurt off and on ever since. It disrupted my life and cost me a lot -- in stress, in worry, in wasted time, not to mention in money (for doctors, pain meds, massage therapists, etc.). This pain was a significant part of my life -- will I make it through okay on a long plane trip? Will it be okay to mop the floor? If I lie on my back to read a book for half an hour in bed, will I be miserable all day tomorrow? It affected my decisions every day.\n\nA friend mentioned this book to me, and said she totally got rid of excruciating back pain. She is not a fan of \"woo\" either, so I took her seriously -- and well, I'd tried everything else already. What would it hurt to buy a $10 book?\n\nAs it turns out, I'm one of those people -- a not insignificant minority, it seems -- who read the book and their back pain goes away (my friend said it took her a few months of dedicated work, and that's pretty common too--but 80-some percent of people seem to get significant, lasting relief).\n\nI read the book about three weeks ago, and have been pain-free ever since. You might be saying \"big deal\" ...but I haven't had a three-week pain-free stretch in 20 years. Also, even on days when my back didn't actively hurt, certain places -- such as my shoulders -- were always stiff and sore if you touched them. That's gone too. I keep pressing on my shoulders to show myself, \"Wow this doesn't hurt a bit.\" This thing that plagued me for 20 years is gone.\n\nHere's what I think is good in the book:\n\n1. Everyone knows that \"stress\" can affect you negatively. For example, people who suffer from chronic back pain or headaches often feel worse under stress. What I never considered, however, is that your own nervous system _creates_ physical responses. For example, when some people are embarrassed, they blush. Their blush is real -- it's not \"in their head\" -- and they're not blushing deliberately or in order to gain anything. Chronic back pain -- real pain, which is not \"in your head\" and not something you're exaggerating or fabricating -- can arise from your nervous system in the same way as a blush, whether or not there's anything \"wrong\" with your back. Just as a blush can arise in some people when they're embarrassed, back pain can arise in some people when they're \"stressed\" -- and everyone is stressed every day. If you're not stressed, you're dead, right? Not everyone blushes, and not everyone has back pain, but people's nervous systems can create physical responses from emotions.\n\n2. Sarno points out that injuries do heal. People break a bone, it heals, and they're fine. People sprain an ankle, it heals and they're fine. Once my back injury healed (20 years or so ago), there was no reason for it to hurt anymore, other than my own nervous system using a familiar \"route\" to cause pain. Then the question is, Why?\n\n3. The author points out that many people with chronic back pain are the \"nice guys\" of the world. People with chronic pain are often very conscientious, do-gooder, perfectionistic, or self-sacrificing types. If it's associated with a certain type of personality, that's a red flag right there that something other than an \"injury\" is going on. A lot of people with chronic back pain also have a history of having been abused as children. What do these two types of people have in common? They tend to deny or minimize or not notice their own feelings. They are the types to say, \"Sure I'll help you move a piano at two a.m. on Christmas in a blizzard.\" They don't even notice that maybe a small part of themselves would rather not move the piano.\n\n4. The author speculates that all this do-gooding and self-denial and ignoring-of-one's-own-feelings and needs (whether it's your personality type, or whether you were raised in an abusive home, or both) also creates a constant pool of underlying \"rage\" (his word, which he uses a lot) from the part of ourselves that doesn't want to move pianos. Here's where it gets speculative. Somehow your body transforms this unacknowledged feeling into pain (just as \"somehow\" the body transforms someone's embarrassment into a blush).\n\n5. The author also speculates that the pain serves as a distractor. Of COURSE you aren't wild about moving the piano! Your back is killing you! That's a socially acceptable reason to admit to yourself that you don't want to move the piano. Of course, you'll probably move it anyway. (By the way, the author rejects the notion of \"secondary gain\" -- i.e., the idea that people with chronic pain use it to get certain benefits like attention or sympathy. He believes the pain serves both as a distraction from emotional pain, and an outlet for / substitute for emotional pain you're not feeling.)\n\n6. Something I found interesting is that people in certain times and places seem to have certain mindbody disorders that are approved by their society as being \"real\" things with physical causes. In Victorian times there was a lot of mysterious paralysis, but it went out of fashion once people knew more about the body and that it didn't \"really\" work that way. In the 1990s there was a lot of carpal tunnel, even though computers were probably easier to use (easier on the wrists) than, say, old manual typewriters where you had to bang the keys. There's a whole lot of back pain today, which often lasts years beyond an injury, and which is remarkably unresponsive to treatments and surgeries, but the medical community supports the idea that an injury you sustained 20 years ago can be hurting you today, so everyone believes that chronic back pain has a physical cause, just as everyone once believed in the paralysis in Victorian times. Almost everyone (like me) can point to an \"injury\" that triggered their back pain, but unlike ever other injury we've ever had, it doesn't get better. It's pretty odd, once you think about it, but everyone -- from doctors to physical therapists to chiropractors to massage therapists to other people with back pain -- reinforce the idea that it's related to a physical injury and there's very little you can do about it. This belief is extremely powerful and helps perpetuate the pain.\n\n7. What I like most of all: I read the book, I thought about all this stuff, I decided his description fit me perfectly (my personality, the type of pain, the length of time, etc. etc.), and once I knew there was likely nothing actually \"wrong\" with my back, it's like the game was up. My brain gave up trying to use that as a strategy. The back pain went away, including the permanent tightness in my neck and shoulders, including the shooting excruciating nerve pain down my leg for which I was being medicated.\n\nIt. Went. Away. I'm off the medication. I'm doing whatever I want. I'm lying on my back for hours every night reading my books. I'm bending however I want. Etc. No problem.\n\nI can never do this book justice. There's a lot more, about MRIs, about people with and without bulging discs, arthritis etc., about people who are told they have to do this or that with physical therapy, \"or else\" (which is pretty much reinforcing the notion that there's something terribly wrong, although plenty of people have bulging discs and arthritic changes and never have a day of back pain). You just have to read it, to see whether it fits you too. If you've had back pain for years, it probably does.\n\nHere's what I'm not wild about.\n\n1. The book seems very psychoanalytic to me -- to me, needlessly so. It talks a lot about \"rage\" and you might not be a person who really perceives that you're feeling \"rage\" (I'm not). But on the other hand, the book \"works\" so I'm not sure that anyone necessarily needs to accept a psycholanalytic explanation. I'm a nice-guy self-denier who probably, if I'm really honest with myself, truly loves to help people but doesn't enjoy moving pianos at 2 a.m.\n\nFor me, all I had to do is, every time my back started to twinge, ask myself to think hard about what I'm feeling, what's bothering me. I say it to myself -- I don't even have to go around refusing to move people's pianos. I just have to say to myself something like \"I really don't like getting up at 2 a.m. to move pianos. I would rather stay in bed. I wish there was some other time -- not on Christmas, not during a blizzard -- when we could move the damn piano.\" I just acknowledge to myself that a part of me feels that way. I also ask my brain to stop my back from hurting, and it does. Then I go about my business. But there's no need for a psychoanalytic explanation, in my opinion, any more than there's a need for a psychoanalytic explanation for a blush or a phantom limb pain.\n\nWe don't have to understand it for it to work. Gravity always \"worked\" whether or not we understood it. Apparently checking in with your own emotions, acknowledging them, and asking your brain to stop sending pain messages also works. I don't quite understand it, but -- like gravity -- it's very powerful.\n\nSo -- like every other idea you encounter in life: Take what works for you, and leave the rest. I've read a bunch of other good books on this topic now too, by this author and others. My favorite so far is Unlearn Your Pain by Howard Schubiner. Only the first five chapters is available on Kindle, though, and I've ordered a hard copy of the rest of the book, so I can't review the whole thing yet.\n\nI wish every doctor who sees patients with back pain would read this book. I wish everyone with persistent back pain would read this book and give the ideas a try. I wish tons of research were being done on this phenomenon. I wish I had come across this book 20 years ago.",
    "I’ve known for a very long time that my diagnosis of back pain would not fit into the mold of the standard model of the traditional diagnosis. Therefore, I never had an MRI or a Cat Scan or visited a specialist for my back pain. My primary doctor examined me while at my yearly physical and assured me that there is no need to see a specialist. I knew this but, his observations assured me of what I already knew.\nI knew any specialist would not be able to diagnose my pain and even if they did, it wouldn’t matter because …\nA.) – I would never have surgery even if they found something!\nand …\nB.) – The traditional recommendation of physical therapy grated on me. (This is the doctor’s favorite method of treating pain when they do not know what do to with you.)\n\nI work in a physical therapy practice and the work I do with patients on a day to day basis has shown me that it’s a mental/thinking process and I just could not buy into the idea that there was something terribly wrong with my back. (Please understand that although I work in the field, it does not necessarily mean that I believe in it.) There’s a story that goes with that but this is not the thread to hash that out.\n\nMy entire existence in the last 6 years has enveloped some kind of healing modality. I have had some trauma (another story) and gradually, my back pain has escalated to the point that it consumes me.\n\nWith that I must add that, today it’s back pain. 6 years ago, it was upper rib pain with a splash of clavicle pain. Along the way, I had an issue with my upper thigh … deep, reaching some tendon or muscle that hindered my ability to take a forward step. When I started working in the field of physical therapy, I began having issues with my feet to the point where it hurt to walk. Guess what I do all day as a physical therapy Tech? I walk and run all day long!\n\nI’ve soon realized that my pain jumps around. It never stays in the same place but up until the reading of this book, I have not been able to grasp why. Why would my pain travel from one place to another which rendered me suspicious of any kind of diagnosis?! Even if you told me, I would not buy into it. You could have told me it was MS or Fibromyalgia or some other disorder and it would not have mattered because deep down, I knew that something was going on in my body and somehow, I knew that I was okay. I could not explain it and even if I did, I was met with those who would cock their head sideways, like some confused puppy trying to understand what you just said; I knew there was another answer to all of my symptoms and questions.\n\nEven though I knew, it took this book to validate that for me. If this book gave me anything at all, it was the assurance that I am okay. It assured me that I am well, I am healthy and that I am normal … Hallelujah!!!\n\nI’ve always wondered how I could be in good health but I could not explain my pain. I eat well. I am active. I practice mindfulness and meditation. I can grasp living in the Now and I embrace each moment as some magical manifestation of this magnificent life. I’ve studied with the guru’s like Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie, Alana Fairchild, Marianne Williamson as well as the voice of Abraham and countless others.\n\nI’ve read the bible! I’ve been to church. I’ve had faith, cast out demons and lived a life of a saint (no really! I’m very disciplined and perfect!) The book describes my traits very well, “Perfectionist, do gooder and low self-esteem.\n\nI’ve done it all and still, my pain woke up with me and laid me down to sleep, night after night/ day after day.\n\nI’ve surrendered to numerous kinds of therapy;\nChiropractic\nAcupuncture\nMyofascial Corrective Therapy\nMassage\nPhysical Therapy\nLymphatic Drainage\nCranial Sacral Therapy\nNET – Neuro Emotional Technique\nEssential Oils\nCBD – Cannabis\nI’m sure I’ve forgotten a few …\n\nI’ve even visited with a psychic, a Shaman and engaged in hypnosis.\nI feel like I’ve done it all. Yes, there were still other options, but none that I would consider or they were not presented to me at a time that I was willing because it didn’t make sense or I was fed up!\n\nI’ve journaled faithfully for the last 6 years. I truly love to write and journaling opened up a porthole of creativity that unleashed something within me that was able to break free and yet, I still had pain.\n\nThere were days that I had a break from the pain and I could not tell you why. It was always a mystery to me that left me feeling frustrated. Why would today I feel better than yesterday? What did I do differently and … I could never come up with an answer!\n\nI got tired of talking to someone who might understand my pain because guess what?! NO ONE UNDERSTOOD MY PAIN!!! NO ONE!!!\n\nIf this book gave me anything and everything it is this: My pain is an illusion. It is not real even though it feels that way! It can be healed! I do not have to buy into the mind game that my body is distracting me from identifying what my feelings are and where the pain is being directed to. I get that now.\n\nI’ve been set free!\nI am normal!\nThere is nothing wrong!\nThere is hope!\n\nI started journaling in an enhanced way. Instead of trying to write my inner musings down in a way that is pleasant to read; making sure that I corrected all of my spelling and my sentences were punctuated to reflect my true feelings, I started unleashing the beast. (Yes, even my journaling needed to be perfect. I never allowed myself to misspell a word or put punctuation in the wrong place.)\n\nHow do I REALLY feel? I’ve gone back to my childhood and began a sentence, only to be brought to the present moment disgusted with the Universe! I am right … everyone else is wrong … and the sooner everyone acknowledges my saintly wisdom, the better this world will be! (Just a glimpse of one of my unleashings) I’ve been afraid to admit that to myself because “What would someone think of me?! I must be a bad person!”\n\nI discovered that I get sick and tired of the bull pucky that I see and read about every day. I had a 20 minute journaling session where something broke loose and when I was finished letting it out, I went about my day. The lovely thing is, my pain has been subsided today. I let something out this morning and the rest of my day, the pain started to dissolve.\n\nThe next day, I awoke in pain however, I knew that I was on to something helpful and I’ve wanted to keep exploring it. Perhaps that is the fuel that keeps us doing the work that this book suggests. It’s going to be a daily practice. It’s going to require me to take the time to scavenge, dig and unleash and I’ve discovered that the only way that is going to happen is if I begin with my first thought/sentence and let it take me from there. I’m too tired to worry about ugly emotions or feelings. I have reached a place of desperation and I’m now willing to bring my ghosts out of the closet.\n\nNo more pretty sentences. No more orchestrated thoughts brought together to form a pleasing and meaningful sentence. No more telling myself it’s going to be okay and then shoving my true feelings down because it may come out and what will people think of me then?This is gut work! This is mining! This is getting dirty and taking off the controlled chains that keep me tidy, organized and presentable.\n\nYes, this book opened up a porthole and I’ve finally been validated. I’m not sure why it took 6 years to find this work but I can honestly tell you that I’m ready. I am ready to face my fears about my true feelings and set them free. If you’re ready and fed up with not getting any answers about your pain or you have exhausted all other means of getting answers and you’re still left feeling you have not been heard, then I recommend you get the book and see what opens up for you.",
    "The explanations and understanding within this book changed my life and gave me the way to heal. This book has contributed so much to my healing and it remains a valued source of encouragement and information for me. I found I gained a full understanding and acceptance of TMS by reading John Sarno's book The Mind Body Prescription first, followed by The Great Pain Deception book by Steven Ozanich which deepened my understanding of the condition and how it was showing up in my life. I have also found The Meaning of Truth by Nicole Sachs very helpful. These are all books to read and re-read. Be prepared, you may be challenged but read with an open mind and you may find yourself on the pages - I did. I highly recommend these books to anyone who has chronic illness and or pain.",
    "I have suffered with Gynae issues leading to debilitating pelvic pain which extended up and down my spine, legs and abdomen for my entire adulthood. I have had operations which were justified but the monthly pain never changed. I was always scared for these times to be out in public, at work etc as the pain was crippling and lasted for hours if not a day or two. I changed diet, did different exercises, changed my life to remove stress, all sorts of positive things.\nI thought this book would be more practical, it spends 4/5ths giving background to his ideas, research etc with the last small section advising what you actually need to do. I did feel disappointed with that I won't lie BUT for the 3 months since I finished reading it my pain and symptoms have been remarkably light. I have not needed painkillers, no TENS machine, no crippling pain it goes on. I have been out and about, riding my bike, doing exercise like the TV adverts of olde...\nI think you need to be a self aware person and allow yourself to be vulnerable, confront/ execute what is asked of you even if skeptical and you will see change.\nI have a few other issues with my health but this has been a most powerful change yet the least time consuming, least invasive and quickest to act. I am stunned.\nShare with friends and keep a copy in store, I will be reading this again - I did not expect this.",
    "Reading this has marked a turning point for me in understanding how my physical symptoms could be generated by my thoughts. I’d previously been diagnosed with anxiety but didn’t feel anxious at all so was struggling to accept this diagnosis. This book explains how you may fail to feel an emotion because your body is instead replacing the emotion with physical symptoms. Paired with working on the structured educational programme on the TMS wiki online, this has really helped me.",
    "After spending an eternity with doctors and physio who could all not fully get rid of my shoulder and hand pain / RSI (from working on the computer), this book alleviated me of all symptoms within two weeks. I am a highly analytical guy and generally do not believe in non-mainstream medical concepts (coming from a family of medical doctors). But what can I say: the checklists of the book apply to me, the described causality is logical and unlike all hands-on treatments the psychological route sustainably cured me. Ridiculous how slow the medical community is to respond to something that has worked for hundreds of thousands of people.",
    "In the old days when you got sick and the doctors couldn't cure you, you went to the shrine at Lourdes in France.\nYou queued up behind the other pilgrims, waited your turn, dipped your hand into the water, and threw away your crutches.\nWell, getting to the Pyrenees in Southwestern France is quite expensive.\nI got the same effect for less than £10.\nIn the summer of 2019 I sustained a back injury while cycling.\nAnd it just got worse and worse.\nI was in pain every day, confined mostly to a chair.\nI could barely walk down to the shops.\nAnd my doctor sent me for the usual battery of tests and could find nothing wrong.\nI suspected there was a psychosomatic component to the pain, but at the same time I didn't understand it.\nBecause I remembered precisely the moment I sustained the physical injury.\nEventually I reached a physical and spiritual nadir.\nMy doctor wanted to put me on permanent painkillers, and I told him I wanted a diagnosis not mere suppression of symptoms.\nHe didn’t like that.\nWe fell out.\nHe told me there was nothing more on the table for me. So, in despair, I went to see Dr Google.\nAnd after 3 days researching the matter I came across the work of this man, Dr E. Sarno.\nOne of the greatest unsung heroes in world history.\nOnline, there are tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people who rave about him. Thanking him for giving them their life back.\nHe’s been largely ignored by the mainstream medical community because his theories concern the notion of a mind-body connection.\nAnd conventional medicine insists that such a thing doesn’t exist.\nFortunately I was fully open to the possibility. As I read his book, I understood with overwhelming force that what he described had happened to me.\nDr Sarno viewed psychosomatic pain as the physical expression of emotional pain.\nAnd this emotional pain could be anything, from some childhood trauma to the new boss at work bullying you.\nHe said that everyone who came to his clinic had the same narrative: they said, oh I I've had this back pain for 10 years, it started when I put my back out picking up a sock, or reaching up into a cupboard et cetera.\nAnd Dr Sarno said, No this is not what caused your pain. The minor injury you sustained healed very quickly.\nBecause that's what the body does.\nBut in the interim the body sneakily located some psychosomatic pain in precisely the same location as your physical injury. So you don't appear to get better.\nIn fact, you seem to get worse and worse and the alarm and panic this generates throws fuel onto the emotional fire and the pain increases and your fear that you have some terrible injury increases in a vicious feedback loop.\nAs far as Dr Sarno was concerned, information was the penicillin.\nHe cured patients with years of back pain merely by explaining this mechanism in two 45 minute lectures.\nIt sounds impossible to believe, but it's true. Within days of reading his first book, my pain had largely disappeared.\nWithin weeks I had returned to perfect health.\nOf course you have to be open to the possibility that there can be such a thing as a mind-body connection.\nSomething which, as far as I can see, you prove every time an embarrassing comment makes you blush.\nBut for those whose minds are closed to the possibility, it doesn't work.\nBut for others Dr Sarno's simple insight, a piece of genius, has given them their life back.\nThere's even a website called ‘Thank you Dr Sarno’. People write to him, long after he died, saying thank you.\nI did too.\nFor the first year after I read his book I wrote a short note 3 times a week, beginning, 'Thank you Dr Sarno.'\nI never sent them, because he was dead.\nBut I hope wherever he is now he can read this.\nThank you Dr Sarno."

    "Great buy at a great price, and fast shipping, too, despite having ordered it during a time when everything is delayed. I will update this review when I take the GMAT as I can't speak for how good the material is as of now.\n\nUpdate 03/30: I've had the weekend to go through the material. It was a pleasant surprise that you also get access to ATLAS, Manhattan Prep's online portal. With that, you also get 6 free CATs, which to buy on its own, would've cost me $50. I took my second CAT yesterday and thought that was extremely helpful in knowing what my strengths/weaknesses are. Here are the other things I love about ATLAS: 9-week study planner, OG Navigator (great if you have the GMAT Official Guide), Basic Math Diagnostic, and finally, there are a TON of helpful content and videos that will encourage you!",
    "Very clear they didn’t proofread. The y/y subjects are the same so the info is good. But the questions are simply low effort. Solutions range between great detail and awful detail. Clear to see some writers cared and some didn’t.\n\nSome errors included;\n\n1. Between al and barb, they listed bob in the answer. Bob’s answer correlated to al.\n\n2. Wrong calculations at very basic levels. Adding when supposed to subtract and whatnot. Really bad.\n\n3. Flat out typos that don’t make sense\n\n4. Some answers have 0 logic behind them when proposing more complicated than needed methods. Poof, here’s the answer.\n\n5. Some solutions simply don’t add up. I can’t believe how egregious some are.\n\nThere are too many errors for me to recommend the problems in it. I recommend using this as a content guide then using the OG for practice.\n\nThis is far below the typical quality of ManhattanPrep.",
    "This was recommended by a friend who scored mighty well on his GMAT. I found the content really useful and the practice tests at par with the GMAC practice test. Great bang for buck!",
    "Product is good and similar with the description. However, delivery was late by about a week. Overall, it’s recommended!",
    "They clearly put alot of effort into this and it's easily the most consise series textbooks with the most easy to understand explanations I have ever used. Admittedly, it's pricey, but you definitely do get what you pay for here. Well worth it if you're serious",
    "The main reason I bought these books was for the online material and the online practice tests. However, my books arrived without an access code even though they’re new. I contacted Manhattan Review and they were very unhelpful. I could never access the portal and this price for three books is absolutely ridiculous. I can’t believe they can’t solve this with the amount of books they must sell on Amazon. Don’t buy this.",
    "I don’t comment on the content.\nBut the book quality is very low, the pages keep detaching from the book.",
    "Dissatisfied with the state of the box. The material is good, but not happy that the box was falling apart. Not a big enough deal to send them all the way back just a hassle.",
    "I personally found eight mistakes in the quant book not listed in their errata website and two in the verbal. The books are falling apart after a couple of weeks and I've just had them on my desk. The binding is terrible. The strategies are great but they seriously need to have someone proof read the material.",
    "The book itself is just okay. There are a lot of typos (even in some of the proofs and answers!) and explanations that are rather ham-fisted. For its price, I don't think the book should have been this bad.\n\nBut what's even more disturbing is, part of the reason I bought the book for the \"free exams\" online. Not only have I not been given access to the materials, when I tried contacting their customer service, they were (1) extremely slow in reverting to me, and (2) unable to resolve the issue despite my having to wait 15+ days for it to be resolved.\n\nI would recommend people just buy the GMAT official guide and avoid this book/company.",
    "I do think these books provide some value in terms of the strategies they teach, but the books themselves are full of errors (text & numbers). Is it worth paying hundreds of dollars to buy this set? Probably not, because you can get the official gmat set for way cheaper and they are way better in terms of having actual problems and content. You want to practice with tons of questions for this exam and these books don't have a lot of questions.",
    "I was thinking of buying the Foundations of Math to begin with, but assumed it would be included in the \"all the GMAT\" set, specifically in the \"All the Quant\" book. Nope! The description boasts combining 10 guides into one, but fails to mention that \"all\" does not mean \"all.\" It's pretty bold of a book set describing itself as \"all the GMAT\" to recommend purchasing an additional book right in the first chapter.",
    "Only the Basics are covered in these books..the advanced sections are only in digital form!!"

    "Bad Blood is an excellent example of how to write a true story and make it sound as exciting as a thrilling page-turning novel. Few true accounts have the bite that author Carreyrou has with this narrative. If you’ve read enough true accounts of companies, organizations, or people who go bad, you know how easy it is for the author to get tied up with so many “facts” and minutia, that the finished product can significantly lose its edge. I’m reminded of a book titled “The Smartest Guys in the Room” about the Enron scandal. Although that book was a best-seller, there were times when I felt as I was reading an expanded version of the company’s 10k report. It simply wasn’t very interesting a lot of the time. Fortunately, this isn’t the case with Bad Blood.\n\nThis is the story of the failed start-up company known as Theranos and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes. Elizabeth Holmes was young, brilliant, attractive, and incredibly ambitious. She dropped out of college at the young age of nineteen, not because she couldn’t handle it nor didn’t like it, but because she was too impatient. She was ready to take over the world and didn’t want to waste time waiting to get a college degree. The company she founded, Theranos, had a very attractive idea that would revolutionize healthcare. The premise? When patients needed extensive blood work, they would no longer need to subject themselves to long needles that would drain a substantial amount of blood to fill up multiple test tubes to perform tests. Holmes set out to create a device that would simply prick a patient’s finger, take a miniscule amount of blood, hook it up to a relatively small box, and within a short amount of time, this little box could perform the extensive tests and give the patient their results in a fraction of the amount of time.\n\nWell, to sum it up, the idea may have been revolutionary, but it simply couldn’t work. Holmes was so persuasive, though, that she convinced many of the wealthy that it could, and managed to raise millions and millions of dollars to try to make her dream a reality. When you end up spending the millions and millions of dollars on your idea that never comes to fruition, what do you do? Author Carreyrou argues that Holmes hemmed, hawed, lied, deceived and stole to masquerade this unpleasant fact. I got the impression that she wasn’t really that bad of a person (initially anyway), yet got so sucked in by her ambition and greed, that she simply couldn’t accept failure as being an option. This kind of behavior, sadly, isn’t that uncommon. We read stories all the time of successful entrepreneurs who plow ahead after continuous failures. Those who make the headlines are the rare few that actually succeeded against insurmountable obstacles. What we don’t read about are the failures; which probably outweigh the successes by a ratio about 100 to 1. Who wants to read about failures? Unless, of course, you have a story as compelling as this one.\n\nThe author is a journalist for the Wall Street Journal, and is actually a part of the story. He pens a piece for his paper that exposes much of the fraud, yet we don’t read about his first-hand recollections until probably 2/3 of the way through the story. Each chapter that he writes is captivating in that he focuses on so many of the key players. Not only do we read about Holmes and her lover/business partner Sunny Balwani, but we read about disgruntled employees, employees who are terminated, employees who are threatened by high pressure lawyers, doctors, patients, lab technicians, investors, and acquaintances. All of them are crucial when reading about this train wreck.\n\nFor me, the highlights are what goes on within the walls of the company. Holmes and Balwani run the startup as authoritarian dictators, and you get the impression that working for this company would be a nightmare. I couldn’t understand why so many of the employees stayed as long as they did. Example: Not only were the different departments not allowed to speak to one and other, but when outside people were brought in for meetings, they weren’t even allowed to use the restroom without being “escorted” to do their business. They didn’t trust outsiders roaming the hallways. Another example: We read about an engineer who worked for the company who designs a lighting system for his bicycle on his free time. When Holmes finds out about this, she’s exasperated. Why? Because her employees should not have any “free time”. She expects them to spend every waking minute of their lives at the office trying to make her impossible dream a reality. This book, I think, could also serve as a case study for companies in teaching management how NOT to treat their employees.\n\nWhen employees quit, they’re threatened by Holmes and Balwani not to say ANYTHING about the company. They then spy on ex-employees, and if the individual makes a passing comment, say, to a friend over dinner, the ex-employee next finds a team of threatening lawyers at their front doorstep with a 25 page lawsuit. In fact, the author himself was threatened many times by these intimidating malcontents. Fortunately, he’s been in the business long enough to know about these scare tactics, and isn’t in the least bit afraid to write about what he knows.\n\nSo another story about a high-profile company that failed, and all of the dirty deeds done to cover it up. What makes this story a bit scary is that the author alleges that such unethical activities happen all of the time when startups are trying to blunder their way to the top. What makes this company unique, however, is that it’s dealing with the health of people. So it’s ok if you design a piece of software “full of bugs” and somehow deceive the public, but it’s a definite no-no when your errors can cause a faltered result on a patient’s blood test. I say “scary” because it really does cause one to be wary of any kind of “new” technology being implemented. Who are we to trust?\n\nAs I write this review Homes and Balwani have yet to go to trial. Of course, Holmes maintains her innocence. I don’t see how anyone could believe her based on what this story uncovers. It will be interesting to see the eventual outcome. A really sad story. Sure, it’s great to be young, ambitious, and chase big dreams, but when those dreams don’t come true, one needs to admit failure and not try to consistently cover it up. So many people still can’t seem to find the courage to admit that they just might be wrong about some things.",
    "Bad Blood, by Carreyrou, is an exemplary tale of a business going bad. It is in line with two other classics, The Deal of the Century by Coll and Barbarians at the Gate by Burrough and Helyar. The former depicts the beginnings of the collapse of AT&T and the second the complex takeover of Nabisco. Both of these tales result in a massive restructuring of businesses, for better or worse. In this case, it describes probably the worst behavior seen in a startup ever and the destruction of whatever business was conceived.\n\nThis is a tale of people who seem to have been brought into a techno-cult, many smart young people who got proselytized by an even younger individual who managed to present herself as super competent but who was fundamentally was intellectually and morally flawed. This book does not depict a tragedy, except perhaps for the young employees who wasted years of their lives and frankly may be forever scarred. It is a book about the ability for a perverse individual and a co-conspirator to convince a significant number of allegedly competent people to dismiss their fundamental judgments regarding reality. There was an induced suspension of belief on the part of many otherwise highly competent people and the acceptance of this almost cult like persona.\n\nI approached this book having done about 35 start-up and turn-arounds, as the principal or investor. Many did well, many were stalled mid-stream, and none went bankrupt. In the process I often saw that my initial premise was altered and thus the business model changed. However in almost all there was a need for a plan and a reporting on the plan to a Board who had a modicum of confidence. In some cases I had Directors call first thing Monday to see what the cash flow of the prior week was and compare it to plan. Reality was always at the fore. Plan and actuals, and interaction with hands on boards.\n\nI have seen deals where one had to pull the plug when reality and expectations were dissonant. In one case an entrepreneur in an investment could not reproduce the core result and worse yet even if they could they had no way to manufacture it. That is not a way to run a business.\n\nI also approach this book as one who has spent time in and around the health care field. Unlike the more common areas of start-ups, health care, including biotech, must live in a highly regulated environment. Human lives are in the balance. Thus one sees the high costs of clinical trials and the failure of many reasonable therapeutic efforts. The FDA and similar entities control with an iron hand the ways and wherefores of these entities. This control system never came to play here until way too late.\n\nNow this can be a tale of many entities: (i) the principals themselves, (ii) the employees, (iii) the investors, (iv) the Directors, (v) the customers, or (vi) the consumers or patients. The author focuses upon the first two giving some limited understanding of the other participants. In particular this is a book presenting the work and hardships of many of the employees over time. It would be interesting at some time to examine the many other dimensions, but this presentation is a well presented self-contained effort.\n\nNow, fundamentally, any investor, and especially a Director, must have an understanding of their Fiduciary Duty to the other shareholders and must execute themselves in any efforts of the company to adhere to that duty. That means effecting a process of due diligence. Due diligence is demanded in any investment and it fundamentally entails: (i) that the product or service can be real and deliverable, (ii) that management has the competence to do so, (iii) that the price point is highly competitive and that the margins are appropriate, and finally (iv) that the people one is dealing with are ethical, honest and competent. It appears that in the case of Theranos, as the author recounts, that many never did any Due Diligence. What is truly amazing is that the venture investors involved would never allow themselves to invest in any other deal without doing their due diligence. Furthermore, the “big name” Directors represented in the book most likely had no idea what due diligence entails. In my experience of the 100 companies I would look at, 2-3 would ultimately pass the test, 80-90 would be dismissed out of hand and the remaining would never pass Due Diligence. It appears that if one accepts the author’s tale, and why not, then there never was any due diligence. “Trust me” is not the basis for major investments, by investors, Directors or joint venture partners.\n\nThe author describes in full detail the creation and buildup of the company and how it managed to go through hundreds of millions of dollars and at the same time achieve nothing. The battles between the top managers and the staff, the high rates of turnover and the outright prevarication of the principals are presented. What is most astonishing is the tale of how the principals dealt with an attempted sale to the DOD. One military officer managed, presented as a highly qualified and competent one, dared to ask a key question of the principal and that principal in turn manages to go to a four star general, now a prominent person in Washington. The General then believing this principal proceeds to call-out his own person. Marines should not, must not, do that; it demonstrates, in my opinion, lack of judgement, and lays the ground for questioning any subsequent judgement of such a person. But the author shows that this example was not in any way unique, if anything it was a pervasive behavior on the principal’s part.\n\nOverall this book is a tale of one individual after another interacting with the principals and how they were manipulated and then thrown aside.\n\nWhat this book does not do is more important. This is not a criticism since answering these issues may fall into the criminal and civil litigation forthcoming. But specifically:\n\n1. Why did none of the accredited investors perform due diligence? Or were there some who tried and then walked away? The book alludes to many of the investors but they seemed to like sheep, just following the herd. This were all competent people. It would be important to understand why they did investments, often of significant amounts, and not due the due diligence and furthermore not demand Board rights.\n\n2. Why did the Directors allow themselves to sit by and have management do what they did? Directors have a fiduciary duty and it appears that none of them were either aware of what their duty was and/or did they have the competence to even ask the questions. The Directors were all prominent people in the fields, but unfortunately none appeared to be experienced in this area. The book does not in any way address the Directors in any detail. That would be an important analysis.\n\n3. One of the most significant “red flags” in any business is the loss of a CFO. When the first CFO left abruptly, the Board should have individually met and questioned him as to why he left. One can understand that the CFO was bound not to speak to others but he can and must speak to the Board. The question is; why not? Perhaps the Board was not qualified to even ask the questions.\n\n4. The fact the young principal owned a tremendous controlling interest and as such could block anything she desired from happening should have raised red flags as well. One must ask; why not? This seems to be a case of true distortion of reality. The question is; why?\n\n5. The biggest unanswered question seems to be; where did all the money go? They seemed to have Safeway and Walgreens pay their own way, the attorneys clearly cost a small fortune, but if the company had a running number of employees of say 100, and the fully loaded costs per employee were say $200,000, then the annual burn rate for the company less CAPEX was $20 million, Even at large CAPEX and attorney fees, one must ask where the money went?\n\nThe author tells the tale via the many employees and their interactions with the two principals. But the other dimensions, namely the investors, Directors, business partners, must be folded into the mix. Again it is perhaps too early to get this tale told properly, but if one is to gain anything from this fiasco, then one must understand those dimensions as well. If only someone had been able to do due diligence. Its lack was the classic red flag!",
    "Drop everything you're doing and start reading it. It's an utterly engaging mix of genres - investigative journalism, psychology (at times psychiatry), organisational behaviour, business & science reporting, and a story of worst and best of the humankind. I've cancelled meetings and events, delayed going to bed just to keep reading this book - the story is almost surreal, and it's hard to believe it really happened, and yet it did.\nI'd like to compliment the author. The depth of the investigation is extraordinary; but most importantly, the narration is done in this perfect documentary style when even the most chilling events are described with high precision but without falling into emotional judgement.\n\nI also would like to say a big thank you to all the sources and contributors who made this book possible. You're very brave people; I applaud your courage and ethics.",
    "I missed this book when it launched, but Alex Gibney's excellent 2019 HBO doucmentry 'The Inventor: Out for blood in Silicon Valley' prompted my purchase.\nCarryrou's book covers three and a half years of investigation into Theranos, its founder Elizabeth Holmes and her meteoric rise and spectacular fall in the obsessive pursuit of a dream. Its a fascinating read and Carryrou uses his research to tell the story from the beginning. The story of his investigations as a Wall Street Journal reporter follows the cronological order of events and is documented towards the end of the book.\n\nEssentially, Elizabeth Holmes developed a start-up in Silicon Valley where she attempted to develop a device which could provide multiple blood test analyses for a range of conditions and diseases in a box not much larger that a large bread-bin. For the user only a small pinprick of blood was required to complete all these tests.\nThis would be a game changer. Some day, every home could have one and for a small charge could carry out blood tests and have them analysed almost immediately, providing early warning of developing conditions. What's not to like? Nothing it seemed.\nWhat makes this book so fascinating, as well as the central characters and story, are the themes it explores such as:\n\nGreed and denial\nThe historty of Silicon Valley start-ups is one where investors always try and get in at the beginning of potentially novel ideas and make a killing. Think Google, Facebook and Uber. Two things drive this. The idea and the confidence/ expertise/drive of those taking it forward. In the case of Theranos Elizabeth Holmes force of personality outweighed any doubts about the concept or the execution. However at the time she started Theranos, she was 19 and a Stanford dropout with no experience in blood testing whatsoever, beyond a grand idea and good connections.\nHolmes exerted an almost Svengali like hold of the people in her orbit. This is partly to do with her physical appearance. Tall; striking blue unblinking eyes; dessed in black turtle necks (a la Steve Jobs) and speaking in a baritone voice. Supremely confident in both her idea and herself she managed to persuade and recruit a Board of former ex- Government Cabinet members; a 4 star General (Jim Mattis of Trump fame) and big name investors, who blinded by either the promise of the idea or the money to be made from it, were sufficiently incurous as to seek the detail of how this invention actually worked. People and organisations such as Walgreens were happy to put hundreds of millions of dollars investment into Theranos without demanding independent expert due diligence of the product.\nAt the time of Theranos's demise it was valued as a private company at $9bn, with Holmes's share of that valuation at $4.5. Up to that point no investor in Theranos had seen the inner working of the product or questioned the fabulous claims made for it. Neither had any member of her company Board.\n\nSecrecy and lies\nHolmes and her senior executive partner were secretive to the point of paranoia over their idea. Two reasons for this. First they were genuinely concerned about their ideas being stolen, but as time went on and they could not get their invention to work the secrecy hid a raft of corner cutting, false promises and outright lies as to how the equipment was performing. Only those in Theranos working on the project could see how far from the truth the claimes Holmes made for the product and its readiness to market actually were. Some turned a blind eye while those with professional or ethical concerns were either fired or left, all under rigourous confidentiality clauses.\nThis secrecy coupled with an agressive management style also stifiled the creative initiative of the Theranos team. Knowledge was power and developers were deliberately siloed to ensure they only worked on their own area so the ability to share thinking across the firm was severly limited.\n\nWeaponising the law\nWhat I found perhaps most shocking of all is the way the agressive use of the threat of litigation is used to force compliance, especially against those who cannot financially afford to fight their corner. The lawyers who command the most fees are the legal pit bulls of the industry. Holmes spares no expense in protecting her secrets and covering her lies with the determined use of agressive legal firms and the threats of legal action to force whistleblowers to keep silent. This extends to Carryrou as well. Of the $900m raised by Holmes in her third funding round, $300m went on lawyers fees!\n\nRegulatory incuriousity\nThe FDA and other regulators seemed broadly incurious about the claims for this machine and remained so until things started to go badly wrong when what was essentially an idea at prototype stage went live to the public. The degree to which private companies can avoid such scrutiny is alarming.\n\nThe debate is still ongoing as to whether Holmes deliberately misled or had sociopathic tendencies. The story is not over. She is now charged with alleged Federal and SEC crimes which carry up to 20 years in prison.\n\nI highly recommend this book, which I think will become a textbook on leadership, governance failure and greed.I also recommend Gibney's HBO documentary which brings to life the people and events in the book, not least Elizabeth Holmes herself. It also adds visual detail on the development of the blood testing device in the way Carryrou's book can not.\n\nHope this is helpful.",
    "This has to be one of the best written books I have read, the style of writing is clear and concise, not overly complex or long winded as often happens with such complex business story. The flow of the writing and story telling is also excellent, it’s an extremely comfortable and enjoyable read. Given how we’ll this book is written I possibly would have enjoyed it even if it had not covered such a interesting topic.\n\nThis story is fascinating, having worked in the software and technology industry for many year, this book rings true, its always shocking to see how unwilling people are to ask the hard question and speak up, even when its clear something is clear wrong within a company.\n\nIt’s a modern day emperor's new clothes, where even big name software and investment entrepreneur can’t see the woods for the trees.",
    "At a time when trust in media is at an all time low in the US, this book reminds us why investigative journalism is still needed to help ordinary people cut through the bullsh*t and see things for what they actually are. This book, which is not only well written and gripping from chapter to chapter, does a brilliant job of showing rather than telling. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to avoid being bewitched by shiny things and big promises. What a great read. Now that I'm done, everything else seems to pale in comparison!",
    "Read this in three days, couldn't put it down. If this was a work of fiction it'd be hard to believe, yet it's fact. The emperor's new clothes on steroids being funded by some of the biggest players in the US and fueled by a complete web of lies, deceit and some seriously shady business practices.\n\nEasily a five star, definitely a must read.\n\nCan't wait to see the film."

    "If you’ve ever led a successful company in the business world or special events industry, you know that the members of your team ultimately deserve the credit for the end result.\n\nIn his new book., “I Love It Here, How Great Leaders Create Organizations Their People Never Want To Leave,” my Emmy award winning friend and fellow speaker, Clint Pulver, does us all a big favor and breaks down the anatomy of a ‘dream team’ and how to strengthen your organization’s foundation so that the core vibe of everyone’s “attitude, behavior, and character” are solid.\n\nThese were a few of my favorite excerpts:\n\n\"I've seen organizations spend valuable time and money trying to fix issues that are actually just symptoms, while the real problem goes unidentified.\"\n\nLike most challenges that arise in life, people focus on short-term fixes instead of diving a little deeper to get to the root cause. This is unfortunately true for our country as well. When it comes to healthcare, billions of dollars are spent each year to “fix” people’s illnesses and ailments with medication and drugs as opposed to simply investing in better lifestyle choices which would prevent most diseases from occurring in the first place and the subsequent ‘side effects’ they are trying to manage on a daily basis.\n\n\"You don't have to love hard work. You just have to crave the end result so much that the hard work becomes irrelevant.\" - Tim Grover (Relentless)\n\nI love that Clint included Tim’s quote in his book. Every time I read it I get amped up. This quote pretty much sums up how my wife and I approach everything we do. By the way, if you haven’t read Relentless yet, it’s a fantastic source of inspiration. I reviewed it a few years ago. Bottom line, keep your eye on the prize and it’s all worth it.\n\n“In contrast to a traditional leader, a Mentor Manager takes the time for one-on-one coaching, focusing on personal growth as well professional growth.”\n\nSometimes things are so obvious they become hard to see. How many times have you felt like you were doing everything you were supposed to be doing as a leader but things weren’t firing on all cylinders with your team? Usually, it’s because of one of two things. You’re either ignoring a problem or you’re not asking your team enough questions. When you actually take the time to find out that a team member is going through a personal challenge at home it allows for what Clint refers to as “fearless, empathetic honesty” to occur in a conversation. If you’re able to achieve this level of mutual trust, you’ll be able identify what might be preventing your team member from performing at their full potential and adjust accordingly. Let’s face it, we all need a little help or flexibility from others with whom we interact from time to time. While not always the easiest thing to pull off, the Mentor Manager relationship is rich with win-win scenarios. Warning: don’t be shocked that when you dive into something, you as the leader might be the root cause of a reoccurring problem.\n\n\"Instead of creating a \"to do\" list\" like many of us do, …. ‘be intentional about clarifying the things you won't do with your time on a given day,’ or even a standing rule.\"\n\nClint knows the power of prioritization. He suggests making a “to don’t” list. Ha! This is great. It reminds me of simple rules we have here at home like “no phones at the dinner table” or “ no dessert unless we’ve gotten some exercise during the day.” In a business setting, it’s really more of a time management concept. No social media scrolling until all office-related tasks are complete for the day. No sitting down at your desks for more than 45 minutes without a stretch break. No complaining about a problem or issue without being prepared to offer up at least one solution. The point is-addition by subtraction. If you’ve ever said that you don’t have enough time to implement the cool ideas you read about in a book, then I guarantee that you are probably wasting precious time watching tv , messing around on social media, or hanging out with unproductive people..\n\n\"When a leader delegates to her team, she doesn't abdicate all responsibility. There is still oversight, guidance, and accountability that needs to take place. It's possible to give your people both, while not feeling like you're losing control.\"\n\nAs a leader and Mentor Manager, balance is key. This holds true for delegation purposes. My friend, Jeff Siber, taught me a powerful phrase and concept many years ago, \"Delegate or suffocate.\" It’s true. At some point, like a nervous parent on the first day of pre-school, you need to let go and ask for help. Clint recognizes that many leaders are type A personalities and want to do everything themselves because they know the job is going to get done right or they know that no one else cares about the business as much as they do (present company included). However, he reassures us that with proper set up and supervision (that doesn’t feel like dictatorial micromanagement) you can empower your team AND still hang on to enough “control” so you don’t unnecessarily stress out.\n\nIf you want to be one of the greats, then hang out with the greats. Do what it takes to associate with the people who are the best at doing what you want to do.\"\n\nRight on. Keep good company! This is a mantra that works at home, at the office, or anywhere you roam. Clint talks about the importance of attending conventions, tradeshows, reading books, or even just following inspirational people online if that’s what your budget and current schedule allows. When I met Clint it was at The National Speakers Conference. It was because I was hanging out with my good friend and mentor, the fabulous Neen James. Neen has been at the top of the leadership and speaking game for many years and was kind enough to guide me both personally and professionally over the years. It wasn’t surprising to me that while at a dinner she organized one evening, I was surrounded by some of the best talent and nicest humans in the country. I happened to sit next to Clint and remember saying to myself, this guy is on point. It’s been a joy to watch him grow as a performer, educator, husband, father, and inspiration to thousands.\n\n\"It's not about being the best in the world; it's about being the best for the world.\"\n\nWhat a great reminder to not only do the best you can with what you’ve been given, but to look at the bigger picture. Trophies, awards, and accolades are nice, but having a positive impact on your family, your team, the environment, the next generation, or a worthy cause is how genuine pride can be attained.\n\nThank you, Clint, for sharing your research and knowledge with the world. I wish you continued health, happiness, and fulfillment.\n\nCheers!\n\n-m",
    "Small businesses are struggling to find, hire, and retain great employees at all levels of their organizations. Many factors play into this, including record-low unemployment, enhanced unemployment benefits, and political pressure to increase the minimum wage.\n\nWhile these are each significant factors, according to Clint Pulver ― aka the Undercover Millennial― the number one reason for employee turnover (spoiler alert) has everything to do with the leader.\n\nIn a recent interview focused on his new book, “I Love It Here – How Great Leaders Create Organizations Their People Never Want To Leave,” Clint highlighted three key areas I believe are applicable to every leader in all areas of life... Create Moments, Be A Mentor, and People Remember.\n\nCREATE MOMENTS\n\n“We don’t remember the days as much as we remember the moments that change our lives,” Clint shared with me when I interviewed him.\n\nAs a young 10-year-old boy in school, Clint had trouble sitting still. His high energy, and what some saw as ADHD, often got him in trouble and sometimes even sent to the principal’s office. While many saw just a young boy who disrupted class, one teacher saw great potential.\n\nThat one teacher was Mr. Jensen.\n\nMr. Jensen also noticed Clint had a hard time sitting still, was always fidgety, and was constantly tapping. But instead of sending him to down the hall to the principles office, Mr. Jensen asked Clint to stay after class for a few minutes.\n\nWhile Clint thought he was probably being sent down the hall, he was surprised when Mr. Jensen asked him if he could pat his head and rub his belly at the same time.\n\nClint quickly demonstrated he knew how to do that, even seamlessly switching hands and repeating the exercise.\n\n“I don’t think you are a problem,” Mr. Jensen told Clint. “I think you are a drummer.”\n\nHe then decided to give Clint a set of drumsticks. This helped Clint pursue the passion of playing the drums and it also helped him recognize the effect that one person can have on another’s life.\n\n“Be A Mr. Jensen” is the story that earned Clint an Emmy Award in 2020. This is 3 minutes worth watching. This just might for you, as Clint teaches, “a single moment in time can change a person’s life.”\n\nBE A MENTOR\n\nIf you were to compare your business, organization, or family to a ship, where would you be on that ship? Do you see yourself at the helm or managing the crew? Relaxing on the sundeck or sweating in the boiler room?\n\nClint put it this way.\n\nLeaders are at the helm, charting the course of the ship, seeing the big picture vision. Managers keep the ship running, are in the details of operations, working to ensure life runs smoothly. Mentors focus on people, concerned with who they are, what’s important to them, how they can help them.\n\nThese are natural roles we would expect to see in a large organization. But how do they work for you in a small business or family?\n\nLeaders in small organizations, who are tasked with a complex mission of guiding from the helm while also managing to ensure operations run smoothly, will more effectively fulfill their mission when they remember to focus on and be concerned with their people.\n\nThis what it means to be a mentor. It’s creating the moments that make a difference.\n\nIt’s being a Mr. Jensen.\n\nPEOPLE REMEMBER\n\nIt’s been a challenging year. As leaders, we have been forced to make challenging decisions. Some of those hard decisions have impacted people around us.\n\nPeople will remember how we treated them during the crisis of the pandemic. Did we make tough decisions with concern for the humanity of others? Or did we come across as, “It’s just business.”\n\nHere’s a hint.\n\nIt’s never “just business” when it comes to people.\n\nClint Pulver suggests the Status Interview can be a simple and helpful tool for assessing where people are at now.\n\nA Status Interview follows this very simple formula. Open the interview by first offering vocal praise for who the person is along with specific praise for their performance. Then ask the following questions.\n\n- What can I do to keep you here?\n- What is preventing your success?\n- How can I help you create that success?\n\nFollow up by creating a Growth Development Plan to help them create that success.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nEverything about Clint Pulver and everything about \"I Love It Here,\" comes down to his signature phrase...\n\n“It’s not about being the best in the world… It's about being the best FOR the world.”",
    "Regardless if you’re in leadership or not, this book will provide you with such incredible insight to becoming a better individual in whatever it is you do. Clint is so transparent with his own experiences and beautifully braids them with experiences of others to really highlight the key components of being a successful leader, person, and community builder. I cannot recommend this book enough as a lead teacher and aspiring administration. Buy this book - I promise you you’ll not regret it.\n“It’s not about being the best in the world… it’s about being the best for the world.”",
    "I walked away from being a 'manager' almost five years ago. It was over something very small really. I granted one of my direct reports a leave real time because he walked up to me and told me how he really wanted to take his girlfriend out on a surprise day out. I was told thereafter by fellow and senior managers how all reports must be treated as mules to pull the carriage that a business is metaphorically. It broke my heart and I instantly walked away from being a manager feeling dejected and alone.\nAs a reportee with another firm, I expect no miracles whatsoever from any managerial structure. I have no hope and remain practical at all times. I believe Simon Sinek, I just don't agree that such places exist.\nI met Clint accidentally in the middle of a technical check during one of his pre keynote preparation time slots. I was instantly glued not realising that his upcoming book was on my list of top 50 reads for 2021. I joined the dots in due course of time and was sold completely...I bought the book right then and there. 24 days later, the book was launched and I've read it twice already. The world needs mentor managers and I am back to believing that I am not alone and weird for trying to be a kind and high performance manager. The pandemic has already shown us how much we take the human connection for granted and Clint's work clearly tells us how the future belongs to empathetic performers over one track war machines. The world needs to hear this message and take the actions outlined in the book today. Kindness is non negotiable and enhances performance like nothing else. Get your copy now!!"

    "This book serves as a high-level overview of the frameworks and tools, written in a highly-accessible way, but is just a taste of how CLG can transform your life and work. CLG, like any set of robust tools for personal development, requires deep practice and dedication. I personally have never found a more powerful set of tools and frameworks than these. I use them in my marriage, in my company, and in my relationships with family and friends. As a result, my life has completely transformed in truly incredible ways.\n\nI've read some reviews that have criticized CLG as promoting \"selfishness / self-centered thinking and living\" I personally have not struggled to do deep personal and inter-personal work using these tools while also engaging with empathy, care, and generosity. In fact, I've consistently found that practicing CLG has brought me deeper, more honest connection with the people around me because I'm able to approach situations from a place of true openness vs reactivity / threat. At the end of the day, CLG is a set of powerful tools and it is up to the practitioner about how they use them in their own life (this is true of many things, including technology and religions). For that reason, I would highly recommend only practicing deeply with someone who is co-committed to CLG. There are certain aspects of the tools you can use generally with folks who are not co-committed, like Integrity, Play, and Zone of Genius. Save the rest for folks who aren't afraid to get messy with you!",
    "TIP - if you're on the fence go to the website at conscious.is/resources and watch some of the videos. Read some of the supporting content.\n\nI deeply appreciate this book and the concepts within. They are potent. I have been in a company where this was \"socialized\" among leadership and it didn't take even though it resonated deeply with me. I took it to my new company where I'm advocating for it and using it with my team. I've purchased the \"shift deck\" cards to get \"unstuck.\" I have a friend that said in doing this work that they had more breakthroughs in 2 weeks than in 2 years of therapy. If as a parent you like \"Whole Brain Child\" or \"The Yes Brain\" you may find principles in here resonate with you.\n\nI agree with the top reviewer that it has pitfalls more regarding how people choose to implement the book than the contents of the book itself. It sounds like someone's spouse got ahold of this book and did what I'm often tempted to do which is bring my \"management\" stuff to the home front. That can backfire depending on the situation.\n\nOne reviewer wrote that the authors create a sense of \"shame\" if you're not into it - you might read the picture attached and draw your own conclusion. I took a webinar and over a hundred people all took a quiz and almost all realized together that we weren't fully deeply ready to embrace this philosophy and there was no shame in that experience.\n\nIn that webinar it was also stated that we should NOT go to whomever we're having drama with and say - hey, i have this book, you're so below the line, etc.\n\nI'm a fan.",
    "Awareness of self without self-righteousness and a culture that allows each employee to reach their maximum potential, increasing productivity, employee engagement and pleasure, are quotes on the back of the book that I have found true when this book is not just read but acted on. It’s practical. It’s easy to read. It’s relatable. It’s full of useful resources, techniques and tool with some research and many stories to support them.\n\nThe book starts with a story of two successful leaders and what a good day looks like. One leader is conscious, and one is not. The conscious leader always strives to be above the line, using the 15 commitments as a guide. Being above the line is a leader who is open, committed to learning and curious. Each of the 15 commitments reflects this in a different way. For example, commitment four is speaking candidly. Above the line leadership commits to saying what is true to me and being a person to whom others can express themselves with candor. Below the line leadership for commitment four is withholding my truth and speaking in a way that allows me to try to manipulate and outcome and not listening to others.\n\nMy copy of this book is well used with bookmarks, turned down pages and underlined passages. I’ve bought three copies and have had five clients buy copies. I’ve been using this book for over a year in my role as a leadership coach and can’t say enough great thing about it. It builds on some of what I know and introduces new concepts in an easy way. I’d also like to complement the authors on a wonderful resource packed website full of videos and pdf to support the book.",
    "My experience with the 15 commitments has been life-changing.\n\nBefore practicing these commitments, I was in a painful work relationship that was harmful to me and my team. I was coming home many days feeling badly about myself. Once I put these commitments to work in my life, I started being honest with myself and the people around me about what wasn't working. I dropped the bullshit excuses I'd been making for years. With the support of other practitioners, I took the difficult step to end that partnership that I wish I'd ended years ago. I've been much happier and freer ever since.\n\nDue to reading this book I've personally seen other people make _major_ life changes to get more of what they truly want out of life. So many people get 'stuck' in their life because they're scared to make the leap from 'just OK' to 'truly wonderful'. This book is about making that jump.\n\nI still have much to learn myself, but can honestly say this book is one of my highest recommendations period. If you want to live a life of joy, peace, and trust with the world around you, crack this book open.",
    "This book is not devoid of anything useful, but I found it a disturbing mix of leadership and quasi-religious advice. The authors are clearly influenced by Buddhist and new age beliefs, rooted in their \"experiences\" rather than research or validated sources.\n\nThey present very questionable conclusions about the nature of emotions and their definition of core emotions, as well as other topics.\n\nI regret that this book could prove misleading and dangerous to individuals who swallow all of the suggestions whole. A book that finds itself in a leadership category, when I believe it should be labelled as a new age guidebook.\n\nWhen a book makes lots of definitive recommendations with no bibliography or sources of evidence to support them a red flag arises in my mind!",
    "The book looks good but upon reading and getting to the full content your realise it’s more philosophical than what other books 📚 on leadership are.",
    "An excellent book on conscious leadership, the kind we desperately need in the world today. Stepping out of the usual low level of consciousness and into one that is more empowering for both the leader and those she or he leads.",

    "As someone who has been working as a Staff Engineer for several years, this book answered several important questions I had about my role and expectations. Moreover, it clarified things that I've observed (about operating at Staff level), that I didn't understand until now.\n\nI wish I have read this book sooner, earlier in my career. FYI, I have both the print and Audible versions.\n\nThis is not a book about engineering management, and it is not about coding or project management. If that's the mindset you are coming from, this book will disappoint.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing what comes after a Senior engineering level (whether you are a senior or junior developer), and how to operate at that level and beyond, this is the book for you.\n\nThere's a certain \"filtering\" that comes with this topic since engineering positions that come after Senior-levels only occur in mature companies that 1) are sufficiently large, 2) are product or service oriented (not limited to web/IT support to other businesses) and 3) are likely to have substantial IP and patents.\n\nI would still recommend this book even for engineers working at firms to do match these criteria, since it covers significant material on how to operate efficiently as a team lead.",
    "As an staff engineer myself, having an external perspective of what does the role entitles in other organizations has been tremendously valuable. Some of the guides or initial chapters are very practical but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the experiences of some of my colleagues in other companies.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone looking beginning a staff engineer or to someone that wants to check areas of personal growth",
    "I’m sure you get this from a lot of readers. Please add my thanks to the long list and know it is very heartfelt. The collection of interviews were very diverse, and truly helped me see various ways the Staff Engineer role can be viewed in various places. I wish I had read them first perhaps I’d have spent less than 3 months completing the book. It was quite hard getting through the initial chapters. Suggestion: print as 2 different books and keep the interviews rolling in! I’m definitely recommending this!!",
    "Just like An Elegant Puzzle, this book is so full of info, ideas, and links out to even more info and ideas. I've out ten hours into reading this and going down the rabbit hole of all the articles linked from the book. Get the kindle version for ease of transitioning through to the linked topics. Great for managers trying to understand their staff+ folx better and especially for Staff+ folx. Already recommending this to everyone and anyone I can get to listen.",

    "Some interesting advice mixed with gratuitous virtue signaling.",
    "I really like how Will writes: he explores relevant systems and tried to distill them. As a newly minted staff eng, this book really helped jumpstart my modeling of how to be effective.",
    "I'm a software engineer interested in developing my career into the staff level. This book is the only one that touches on this topic that I'm aware of. Sadly, the writing is awful, and the book's production quality isn't much better. The author could've used a much better copy editor. There are sentences that use the word \"folks\" four times, no exaggeration. It's tedious to read this book, which is too bad because occasionally it offers some useful insights.",
    "The book is very useful and full of others experiences. It can help a lot to have good understanding of the role.\nI think it aldosterone very helpful for mid-level engineers to determine their path and also work on their skills early in the career to reach staff positions",

    "I read this book for a Public Administration course in my Master's program and I am very thankful for the professor who assigned this text. Having read several economics books and having heard analysis of policies with regard to economic models, it's good to have this as an alternative framework.\nFor me Stone's perspective seems intrinsic, She holds that interpersonal connections within a society drive the dynamics and perspectives within, rather than the informed self interest of individual actors. This comes off as a much more realistic portrayal of how individuals view choices. We are not able to balance every action as to pick and choose what is solely advantageous to our being, we do with what we have and we try to accommodate for those around us and those that we love.\nUsing this premise she guides us through the different dilemmas perceived regarding policy interpretation. She first explores the different aims of policies and how they may be seen as being in conflict, like liberty and welfare. She elaborates that these goals are at times irreconcilably at odds and administrators have to do the best they can with what they have, with any social dilemma there is never any clean, utilitarian solution. However, she argues too that there may be a perceived problem yet multiple aims may be achieved, one does not have to forgo a goal [equity] for another [efficiency] or one demographic for another.\nFrom this she discusses the manner in which policies are framed and how the very framework one poses an issue may slight it to a particular stance. Such as calling medicaid welfare or help to the poor during a debate or a stump speech.\nAt end Stone discusses the different ways in which policies are enacted and the intrinsic difficulties with each process of implementation. Such an example she uses is a common one with Rules, some groups and individuals choose to subvert rules because there is an acceptance in being alternative. Stone also informs the reader of ways in which the electorate may be coerced without legal action. Such would be the case of controlling the information the electorate receives or spinning it in a specific way that is advantageous to an elected official or entity of government/business. Such examples contradict the assumptions economic models make in individuals having unlimited access to all forms of data.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written, informative text that is easy to read. I believe you can be of any educational background and understand the concepts Stone lays out within. That being said I believe this text only provides a framework, as is the purpose of the text. If one wants to make informed decisions regarding policies or simply be well informed, they will have to pursue more exhaustive literature.\n\nI give this a book a 5/5 for being informative and providing a vital perspective to policy interpretation while still being easy to read.",
    "This review is a concatenation of an older review from before I finished dealing with the book, and a new review now that I have had time to reflect on it. I have changed the number of stars from four to one, because really, rather than being a good primer for those who know little about public policy, it is an overly verbose and narrow version of a primer for those who know little about public policy, with some very important flaws that should not be included if they might shape a student's worldview. Anyway, here are the reviews:\n\nUgh. I had to read this for a public policy class. I find the topic intensely interesting, but I did not like this book. I almost never give bad reviews, but after shelling out a bunch of cash for a textbook that could have been written in 20 pages or so for an informed audience, and then having to read the dang thing, I felt that I had to review it. This would be great for a middle or high school class, maybe, but not for college. By the time one gets to college one should have a basic understanding of most of the things in this book already, and an overview should be sufficient to fill in any gaps. What ends up happening instead, is that students invariably get tested on Stone's own interpretations of things at the expense of any actual critical thinking or scholarship beyond what she proposes specifically, and class time is boring, and the tests are agony--not because the concepts are hard, but because breaking things down into the exact definitions and parameters that the author does is frustrating and often narrow, even when not considering the fact that her views and explanations pertaining to economics, the behavior of markets, and the nature of society are restrictive and, I assert, often misinformed. Also I disagree somewhat with her assessment of fundamental human nature. She should at least entertain other possibilities. I would like to see some history included in the book as well, because everything as presented as though there are two or so ways of viewing each aspect of a problem/paradox/idea, when in actuality there are usually many more than that, and the easiest route to finding them might be history.\n\nPlease, if you're going to read this review, read the whole thing. I hated having to deal with this book. I'm not a genius or anything, but having had to read this book for a class, I DID NOT LEARN MUCH OF ANYTHING FROM IT. Maybe I'm just too wrapped up in the process of policy-making or something already, or maybe I just pay too much attention to what the government does, or maybe my middle and high school education was good enough to cover most of this information such that I picked it up directly or just passively, but this did not seem to be a particularly helpful book. Also, it is fairly terrible at discussing market policy and the basic ethos (of the author?) laid out at the beginning of the book was cynical and enraging. Now, it is also possible that I have not yet been beaten down with reality yet somehow--even though the level of cynicism I have when I view a lot of public figures, public policy, and the general public itself is enough to bother people around me, I am still hopeful and idealistic that things could be done better and that people are capable of being good. Otherwise what's the point and how has civilization ever progressed away from servility? I recommend this book to people who don't know how policies are born, discussed, or implemented. Even though it is more verbose than it needs to be, it should get the job done. Just read it in a few sittings and be done. My heart goes out to anyone who has tests that require that them to remember and cite examples from the book about things, rather than any relevant policy example that one can think of from real life. It is horrible. I wish professors would just have their students write in depth papers of various sorts and have information like what is contained in this book be a required background. It would be more useful and waste a lot less of people's time, then again, maybe wasting time when you would rather be doing something more productive is a good introduction to what it feels like to be a bureaucratic cog in the machine of state, idk. Something to look forward to I guess. Wish they'd make a rental kindle edition.",
    "This book is a classic for good reason. It lays out concepts clearly, intelligently, and convincingly, all while sounding conversational and not overly technical, as is a pitfall of many academic publications. Stone's frameworks are just that--frameworks--and are useful for structuring one's analysis of policy, while also recognizing that no real world situation fits the frameworks perfectly.\n\nMy one large critique of Stone is her extremely apparent liberal bias. While the ideas she presents are not inherently liberal or conservative (though one could certainly make the argument that the 'market model' she argues against is a conservative one and the 'polis model' she champions is a liberal one), the examples she draws to illustrate them are biased towards a liberal perspective. Whenever she presents something 'bad' done in a policy situation, it is almost always a Republican or conservative doing it, while liberal ideas and actions are almost always presented as the 'right thing' to do or a compassionate application of policy. Even as a liberal myself, it got a bit grating towards the end of the book. At times in certain chapters it seemed like Stone was soapboxing about an issue, even if that issue was only tangentially relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nIf you can get past the bias, and perhaps only skim the examples she uses, there is still a lot to get out of this book.",
    "I found this a very informative book on basic concepts of public policy. Stone does her best to give the readers an enjoyable read by not being 'informative and dry' all the time. What I do miss is an overarching view on the concepts she outlines.",
    "Pleased to see a reviewer comment on conservative -v-liberal bias\nWe seem to be generally unable to approach a policy or many other matters with clear perspectives. Must be human nature.",
    "If you like politics, this book will be such a pleasure to read. It unveils not so obvious strategies of political communication and conceptualization of ideas.",
    "Deborah Stone took what could of been be a very dry topic and made it engaging and accessible for students. It made my course on process and formation of public policy much more engaging and enjoyable."

    "Absolutely timeless perfectly surgically written book. Extremely life changing. This book should be a requirement in life. Love this book.",
    "Good book",
    "Great. I've been doing this all along..but not very well. Doubt is easy, belief is hard. Have a plan. Realistic or not ,it's according to your beliefs",

    "A little outdated and definitely gender polarized,\nbut there is enough good information to warrant reading this book.",
    "If you are interested in this book at all then you may or may not know that Napoleon Hill was one of the early 20th Century writers (Along with Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale.) who literally gave birth to the motivational speaker/writer industry in the USA. Ordinarily, that fact alone would be high praise and a recommendation. But Hill's book suffers from a writing style that comes from 19th Century journalism that can be difficult for modern readers to follow. His material also suffers from the fact Hill was eventually exposed as a liar. In this book, Hill claims to have met famous business and political figures, interviewed them and studied their successful behavior for years before he found a publisher for Think And Grow Rich. In fact, he met few or none of the characters he mentions in his book. Hill mostly derived what he knew of them from newspapers and the public library. Still, Hill translated his ideas and lies into a motivational industry that published books and national radio broadcasts that made him rich. For a while. Late in his life when his ideas and teaching failed to produce a broad level of public success and the people he claimed to have known indicated they had never met Napoleon Hill, he was discredited and died poor. But don't let these facts totally discourage you. Many of the success stories and theories Hill writes about can be used. Probably should be used. What Hill said in this book about the people he never met is mostly accurate. And it is likely and possible that if we follow the example of men like Andrew Carnegie, Woodrow Wilson and the like we can learn and prosper from their examples. And the fact remains, Napoleon Hill did successfully turn these examples into a profitable industry that never existed before. So read the book. Learn what you can from it. And forgive a man who wanted to succeed so badly that he would do anything to achieve it. Including lie to us all.",
    "I can't believe how brilliant was mr. Hill. He has become an idol for me. This book should be required reading and analysis in primary school. People need to know how to think to be successful in life.",
    "...I'm still poor :-)",
    "This book enthuses the reader with a burning desire to be successful, whether it is by materialistic or academic means. The book will give you an understanding of how a successful person is nurtured. Examples include the amazing inventor Thomas Edison; how he formed success despite all odds by being ignorant of the air of pessimism. By far my favourite lesson learnt from this book was the significance of indecision.",
    "I didn't like the word ”Nature.” It didn't sound like Napoleon Hill but I'm enjoying the text.",
    "This book help me and too all i advised it to read it. You must not read it as a book but study it as a course and I promise within 3 to 5 you will have whatever you want. No I guarantee it.",
    "Excellent book, one that everyone must read in their lifetime if you are looking to develop or enhance a success mindset! Paperback is of a brilliant quality."

    "One of my top 20 books. The ideas and action items provided in this book were thought-provoking and helpful. Excellent resource for anyone not just those in corporate America. Scott provides countless ways to engage in courageous and fierce conversations.",
    "If your relationships at home or work could use improvement, then this is a must read book. The title is probably a little misleading and perhaps intimidating. After all, most people I know do not like confrontation. And the title sounds like you will be having toe to toe, screaming matches. But a fierce conversation is not about who can shout the loudest.\n\nThe book is based on the fundamental truth that most of the time we have polite conversations rather than real ones. We talk about things that are safe rather than the things that really need to be talked about.\n\nSusan Scott has written a wonderful book that address the importance of having real conversations and then tells you how to make sure you can pull them off.\n\nFor starters, she says the purpose of a fierce conversation is to\ninterrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges and enrich relationships.\" The last point is so important. Lots of people have tough conversations but often these cause the relationship to deteriorate.\n\nIf you follow the steps, you will not only talk through the tough issues, you will build better relationships. This is true for work relationships as well as personal relationships.\n\nScott addresses five different types of conversations. They are: team conversations, coaching conversations, delegation conversations and confrontational conversations. And she gives the model and example for each.\n\nSusan gives seven principles to guide a person in their fierce conversations. They are: Master the courage to interrogate reality, Come out from behind yourself and make the conversation real, Be here, prepared to be nowhere else, Tackle your toughest challenge today, Obey your instincts, Take responsibility for your own wake and Let silence do the heavy lifting.\n\nI do not know anyone who uses silence as they should. Most people are too eager to tell their story, show how much they know, they forget to let silence into the conversation.\n\nThe book does a marvelous job of discussing how to truly have fierce conversations. But an underlying theme of the book is that most conversations are with your self. On occasions, other people are involved. If you want to truly master fierce conversations, you must master them with your self first.\n\nIt is not a book to just read and file away. This is a book you need to keep handy, refer to often. The appendix has some wonderful worksheets and questions and there is a User's Guide at the end.\n\nThe book is well written, easy to read with lots of helpful examples. If you implement just a portion of the wisdom in this book, it will change your life.\n\nThe big lesson is to interrogate reality in all your conversations. What are you pretending not to know? What are you afraid to discuss with your boss/ co-worker or spouse?\n\nA polite conversation is a failed conversation because you did not talk about the issues that are crying to be addressed.\n\nTruly a life changing book. Susan has written a companion book that I also highly recommend - Fierce Leadership - check it out.",
    "I really like this book. I was always timid about conversations that might bring strong emotion with them, this taught me how to have them and I got to practice each skill at the end of the chapter. Now I know how to approach fierce conversations as well as have them with people when they are needed.",
    "How often do you walk away from a conversation having talked around an issue, but not about it? How often do you not fully share your thoughts? How often is this conversation with yourself?\n\nThese questions form the heart of Susan Scott’s book, where she challenges us to step into Fierce Conversations with others and ourselves. At its core, Scott challenges us to interrogate reality and talk about the things that are most important, assuming (rightly, I believe) that we often avoid doing this to our own and others detriment. She outlines four key components that form the structure of this book. Interrogate reality. Provoke learning. Tackle tough issues. Enrich Relationships.\n\nTake one (of many) insights as an example of what you might appreciate about this book: Ground Truth. As Scott references, Ground truth is an old military term, referring to what is really going on on the ground as opposed to what officials are talking about back in the strategy room. As one might imagine, these are often different, sometimes vastly different! Think of this as the talk after the meeting around the water cooler, the things that are rarely brought up during the actual meeting. Stated truth and ground truth are often misaligned.\n\nIn my own life I have to admit that ground truth can be hard to come by. How often do I really express fully what I’m thinking to friends or family? How often do I hold back my full thoughts at work or in meetings? How often do I have things that really need to be said, but avoid saying them for fear of safety or that the other person wouldn’t care.\n\nWhat I appreciate about Scott is she challenges us to have the tough conversations. Interrogate reality so you can get to ground truth. This isn’t easy, and by no means does she advocate that we shouldn’t be thoughtful about how we communicate this (cf. Chapter 6, which is a beautiful summary of how to note our emotional wake). But I think most of us, or at least myself, avoid many ground truth conversations and opt into not talking about the hard things. Scott inspires me to have more hard conversations, because often you have to go through those hard conversations to get to richer, fuller relationships. And, it is impossible to make the best decisions in work without ground truth. We’re literally shooting ourselves in the foot when we don’t show up with all of ourselves and our ideas at work.\n\nOther things you may get out of this book:\n\nLiving life in personal integrity\nThe power of shared vision at work\nTips and outlines of how to effectively engage in difficult conversations\nThe power of understanding our emotional wake\n\nDefinitely worth your read. You won’t be sorry you’ve read this if you’re looking for something to inspire meaningful self-reflection on your life, work, and relationships.",
    "This book contains a powerful message: the conversation is the relationship. In other words, it’s how we show up to every conversation - whether with family, colleagues, friends or employees - that determines the quality not just of our relationships but of our lives. This is powerful stuff. It’s about the importance of really seeing others, of having the courage to go beneath the surface and explore what’s really there. Scary, yes. But, Scott tells us, the risk if you stay on the surface is scarier still; whereas the results if you’re prepared to look further, go deeper are rewarding, uplifting, enriching for all involved. Great practical tools and powerful principles are supported by case studies, quotes and stories from the author’s own experience. Applying the principles outlined here could change your life. If you have the courage to let it.",
    "The key principles are really useful and there are some highly practical tips but I found many of the anecdotal examples cited to be very long winded, not really relevant to my field and the american context not conducive to an easy read. A distilled version to around 30% would have been brilliant",
    "A must read for anyone who has walked away from a conversation reflecting on how poorly they managed it. This has loads of great advice and tools to succeed one conversation at a time.",
    "Clever clever book. Great tips on how to surface the real stuff that's going on in life and business. Within a week of reading, I had worked through some issues that were really bothering me and managed to surface them in my business life in a positive and effective way - galvanising action that was long overdue. Like having a weight lifted off my shoulders. Spreading the fierce conversation message wherever I go - this is a great book, practical, easy to read and so so true in its observations - for anyone who struggles with conflict or is so busy being nice that they dont say what really matters (which the author believes is all of us to some extent), read this and settle into life in a new way.",
    "This book is quite simply the most important 'self help' or 'self improvement' book I've ever read. I wanted to improve my listening skills; with colleagues, with customers, with friends and with my family. I wanted to find ways of continuing to 'tell it like it is' without making people feel like I had not heard what they had to say. This book unlocks the potential to do that, one conversation at a time.\n\nHeartily recommend it to you.\""

    "I normally don’t leave reviews, but this was such a great book about becoming wealthy! It’s simplicity and steps to become a wealthy are deep! Do the journal prompts! I started seeing 888 angel number which is an abundance sign. I intend on re-reading and journaling again to reaffirm the changes I want to make!",
    "I am a Guy who Reads Books on Personal Development and Finances and I somehow stumbled and found your Book on Kindle!!. I just finished Reading it Today on (8/4/22) 12:08 p.m. and I can't wait to start applying The Homework Exercises at The End of Each Chapter and to inquire and find out how much your Course MMM ( Money Makeover Mentality) costs to buy it in the Near Future!! Indeed a Great Book to Buy, Read, and Apply which I will Now!!!😁👏👏👏👍",
    "Amanda Frances's work was recommended by a few people - so I checked out her free content on YouTube and social - I really liked her attitude and expertise and experience. Got this book and I find it to be easy, relatable, straightforward and practical; and it gets results. I appreciate her humor, a very solid education and background in psychology, and just from my own experiences I thoroughly agree with AF's money mentality approach. I recommend her to anyone looking to increase their flow, business, income and wealth by beginning right where they are, and prepared to do the work on their end.",
    "If you don’t already follow Amanda F on social media, you should do that too. She walks the talk. Her exercises are really helpful. Her writing is relatable and easy to follow. This is a great book. Money mindset is something we should all be more conscious of. I have given this book to friends. It is also a book that could easily be reread over and over.",
    "Her message is so powerful it bears reading it again and again. What an amazing world it would be if we all felt this empowered and YOU CAN by following the instructions in this book and feeling the positive energy. May everyone manifest their best lives serving the highest good of all.",
    " You don’t know how deep rooted you are in a particular mindset until someone points it out, challenges you and pushes you to be uncomfortable in digging it out. Reading this book is a current self development practice of mine and I feel like I am learning a new language. I am taking the time to sit down and read/listen to this with a small group and we are giving each other feedback and support as we dissect this by chapter. We are also taking the time to do the homework in each chapter, so we can delve into the topics further. We are halfway through and I already understand why people love to re-read this and share it with others. Highly recommend this book 👏🏼",
    "I have been going back to this book on and off since it was published ~2 years ago. Amanda Frances is brilliant and helps you to get in the drivers seat of your life, particularly for money but really it’s about everything else too. Make sure you have a journal on hand while reading this — writing down some of her motivational statements while writing my own thoughts has ingrained her methods. I am so excited about what’s next, and I would recommend this book to literally anyone (which probably is everyone!) contemplating money.",
    "I first discovered Amanda Frances on YouTube in the middle of the first UK lock down. My mental health was at a real low point, being at home allowed me to think of all of the wrong decisions I have ever made that resulted in me still living in my Mum's house with no money and no prospects at the age of 27. What sets Amanda apart from all of the other mindset coaches is that she really digs deep into why you don't currently have the money/life that you want, and for a lot of people it comes down to feeling unworthy of it. Amanda has helped me work out exactly when and why I stopped considering myself worthy of good things and with the strategies she presents in this book I am slowly but surely working my way through my issues and for the first time in a long time I have hope for the future. This isn't just a book about money, it's a book about learning to love, trust and believe in yourself.",
    "As a whole, the book basically advises you on how to get rid of a poverty mindset, know that you are truly worthy of wealth, and become more aligned with your true heart’s desires. After each chapter, there is a chance for you to journal your thoughts and answer questions which prompt you into a more wealthy and confident state of mind in your present being. I think it’s a good book, but it’s nothing that law of attraction heads have never heard before.",
    "After all the hype about this book I found the content disappointing, repetitive and poorly written. Considering the number of times Amanda Frances mentions how much she earns it seems odd that she did not get her book professionally edited and left such glaring grammatical errors. The content includes manifestation techniques along the lines of many other books and does includes useful tips, however she uses the same words constantly and the book feels like she voice recorded it and did not read it back. She uses the book to promote her courses constantly yet the examples of women who have given feedback are not that inspiring. Unbelievably my first review was not allowed because I mentioned the f word in the title because it is used a lot in the book. It loses it's impact after that many times! Not sure why so this book has so many 5 *.",
    "I am an MMM alumni. So I didn’t know if I would get much from this book. But I love Amanda, so bought it anyway.\n\nWell, what can I say. I still took away SO much from this book. Her knowledge has sunk in even further than before. My understanding has deepened. And since reading it, income revenues that had been dead for almost a year, are suddenly picking up out of nowhere.\n\nI would highly recommend this book, and all of Amanda’s work.",
    "I was going to wait for the physical book but couldn’t help myself and got the Kindle version. I am SO glad I did! This book is absolutely brilliant, great personal stories and really clear insights. Get it, you won’t regret it"

    "This book, first published in 1946, explains common fallacies (a false or mistaken idea) that are particularly common in the field of economics and public policy. At the very start of the book Mr. Hazlitt explains:\n\nEconomics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine -- the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for then plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.\n\nIn addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.\n\nAt first it seems as though not much has changed since the end of World War II. What has changed, though, is the scope of the dangers Mr. Hazlitt identifies. That's because government is much expanded and more assertive today than when this book was written. In 1946 the New Deal was not very old, and the tremendous expansion of government social programs was still in the future. We should take these lessons as even more important today.\n\nIt is the overlooked consequences that cause harm. They are overlooked sometimes because they are difficult to see, as in the broken window fallacy explained by Frederic Bastiat and also in this book. They are also \"overlooked\" because, as Mr. Hazlitt tells us, one group wants special favors from the government, and although there is no way to grant these favors without harming some other group, the favor-seeking group will seek to hide, obfuscate, muddle, or minimize the bad effects. At the same time they promote the policy as good for everyone. This is largely the job that lobbyists perform, and billions are spent on it each year. That's because a powerful government has the ability to bestow valuable favors, those favors being paid for by someone else, someone often not easily seen.\n\nAn example of overlooked secondary consequences is government spending. When government spends, it means it must tax or borrow. What government spends is not available for individuals to spend. When we see magnificent public works (say a new downtown arena in Wichita), we don't see all the things that would have been bought had the government not taxed to build the public work. We see the jobs created by the public work -- all the construction workers that will be building the new arena -- but we don't see the jobs destroyed because people had to reduce their spending elsewhere.\n\nForeign trade is a case where people often fail to grasp the complete picture. We often see exports as something good for our economy, while imports are seen as bad. Imported things are things that American workers can't compete with, and so American jobs are lost, it is often said. But as Mr. Hazlitt says: \"It is exports that pay for imports. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. The smaller imports we have, the smaller exports we can have. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have to funds with which to buy our goods.\" So those wanting restrictions on imports are also -- although they do not say this, either because they do not recognize it or it doesn't matter to them -- calling for fewer exports.\n\nIn recent years we have been told that our is a \"consumer-driven\" economy, fueled by people tapping their home equity that accumulated from increased home values, or spending by going into debt. It is as though if consumers started saving rather then spending on immediate consumption, the American economy would collapse. But Mr. Hazlitt tells us that \"saving is only another form of spending.\" After all, what is done with money that is saved? Today, few put their savings under the mattress. Instead, it is loaned to a bank or invested. Then it is spent on capital goods, which businesses use to increase their productive capability. The key fact is that businesses spend it. And, they spend it on capital goods that either expand their capacity to produce, or decease their present costs of production. Either way, that is good for everyone. It means more jobs, and better jobs. But this saving is derided as not being \"productive.\"\n\nAs a conclusion Mr. Hazlitt tells us:\n\nAnd this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than producer, are considered.\n\nTo see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.\n\nThis is a very valuable book, which while dated a bit, cuts through the fog and haze of economics and public policy and lets us understand the effects of our government's policies.",
    "Great book. Still very practical to today. If you like economics but aren’t an economist, this book breaks it down without a bunch of equations and unnecessarily complicated scenarios.\n\nThe book is pretty much all common sense, but it does a great job expanding on the basics and reinforcing the “why” behind the “what.”",
    "“Economic history,” Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises wrote “is a long record of government policies that failed because they were designed with a bold disregard for the laws of economics.” In a persuasive and readable book I just finished, Economics in One Lesson (originally published in 1946 and updated through the 1970s), business writer Henry Hazlitt—an admirer of von Mises—analyzes the many myths and delusions that lead us, and our political leaders, to constantly seek the proverbial but impossible free lunch.\n\nHazlitt argues that bad economic policies result from a common mistake: looking only at the immediate initial effect of a law or policy—its isolated benefit to one politically targeted group—while failing to consider its effect on other groups or society in general. He credits 19th century French economist Frederic Bastiat for this insight. In an 1850 essay entitled “What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen” Bastiat wrote: “In the sphere of economics an action . . . or a law engenders not just one effect but a series of effects. Of these effects only the first is . . . seen; The others . . . are not seen; we are lucky if we foresee them. [A bad] Economist . . . relies on the visible effect, while the good one takes account both of the effect one can see and of those one must foresee. [F]or it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous and vice versa. From which it follows that a bad Economist will pursue a small current benefit that is followed by a large disadvantage in the future, while a true Economist will pursue a large benefit in the future at the risk of suffering a small disadvantage immediately.”\n\nDoesn't this describe many shortsighted policies and laws that have been adopted over many years, by both political parties in the U.S., in efforts to help one group or segment of society and then another, without considering the effects on society at large? Trade protectionism and tariffs that benefit a few politically influential industries or groups but drive up prices for all consumers. Farm subsidies that drive up food costs and keep inefficient farmers in business, preventing more productive farmers from acquiring land. Minimum wage laws that increase unemployment by forcing employers to terminate (or not hire) workers whose costs would exceed revenues that would be earned by hiring them. Rent controls that help current renters but create blighted slums when owners can’t afford to repair buildings, and housing shortages when unprofitable investment in new housing plunges. Democratic governments constantly adopt laws and policies intended to help one particular group without considering the long-term consequences or effects on other groups or society at large. These laws and policies are not only often self-defeating, failing to accomplish their intended purpose, but injure living standards by suppressing economic efficiency and productivity.\n\nHazlitt notes that such improvidence is not new; in fact, it is built into the so-called “division of labor” noted by Adam Smith. As soon as humans begin to specialize and exchange the products of their labor, each person has a vested interest in obtaining maximum value for the goods or services he produces, while minimizing the value others get for their products and services (for which he must pay out of the value of his own work). Thus, the temptation always exists for groups, through political influence, to strive to obtain special benefits or concessions from government, regardless of the cost to others. “What is not seen,” Hazlitt says, are the indirect and cumulative effects of such political favors; as more and more interest groups obtain benefits from government, and the effects connect into a vicious circle, all consumers (including workers in favored industries) are harmed by higher prices, inflation that devalues salaries and savings, and suppressed living standards.",
    "I read this very quickly and enjoyed almost all of it, the only exception was some areas that were a bit repetitive as similar examples were given of the same point. The key lesson though being that economic policies are often designed for the group most immediately affected, but ignore the long-term, secondary and tertiary effects on everyone else. Some great examples of this are then given. It's also all written in an engaging and enthusiastic style, making it easy to read even for the non-expert.\n\nOne point just to make though is that despite the title this is not an introduction to economics for a beginner. Instead this is a summary of his frustrations with common economic proposals, so it's easier to read if you already have some economics under your belt.\n\nFinally I'd mention that the author has some clear ideological views that he tries to push. A lot of this is because he repeatedly refutes arguments because they result in an inefficient economy, taking the view that a perfect world is one where every task is done by the person/country/company that can do that task most efficiently in terms of least capital, resources and personnel. This ignores two key points. Firstly, systems often have to sacrifice efficiency for robustness, and sometimes having inefficient local production subsidised in some way is useful as it is insurance against supply disruption. The other point is that at no point does he mention inequality as a factor. I'd think that there are many trade-offs where aggregate human happiness is greater with a smaller pie, more evenly shared, than a larger pie unequally divided.\n\nOverall though a good book, and a nice quick read. Whether you think government involvement in the economy should be increased or reduced this is a good book to read, making the argument for limited government involvement in the economy clearly and concisely, against which the reader can form their own view.",
    "The title is disconnected with reality, you won't learn much economics from this which was pretty dissapointing. The point of the book is kind of the Thatcher / Cameron / May argument about not spending more than you earn or magic money trees. Of course this is pretty much monetarism 101 which is fine if that floats your boat but not the only game in town. You don't have to be spendy mcspendface to realise there is a time and place for Keynesianism or government intervention in the economy (lord knows there has been enough of it in the last 15 years). Its fine to be more one side of this particular fence than the other but good to acknowledge the other side exists. Disingenuous analogies between households and the overall economy help no one.",
    "From a simple scenario of a broken window, Hazlitt develops a series of arguments which demonstrate some of the fallacies which we now seem to accept as gospel. Lucid, well written and full of lessons our current crop of politicians (of all parties) should learn, this book taught me more about economics and the laws of cause and effect than most economics texts I have read.\n\nIf you believe that government is the answer to every problem then this isn't the book for you - you will disagree with something on almost every page. If you think our government is the problem then buy this now and you will be reassured to discover just how right you are.",
    "Home spun economic philosophy for libertarians. Thing is I'm sympathetic to his philosophy but that doesn't mean I'm an amoeba. If Mr. Hazlitt or his acolytes believe economic life is that simple then we'd be living in a libertarian state by now. Much like it's nemesis communism its all very well in theory so long as reality doesn't get in the way. Or god forbid those messy humans. Don't bother reading this unless it's an option instead of a root canal.",
    "I would recommend this book for everyone who is really interested in economy.\nI choose this rating because it explains the idea of `free market` which is in this case an economy in which government and bureaucrats creating it make as little amount of regulations as possible. In the beginning of the book author says that it is his intention to convey his message to as wide number of people as possible. That is why he decided to use every-day language in its simplest form. I think that he menage to do it. Thanks to the simplicity of the language I could understand his lesson.\nIn this book he gives numerous examples in which he shows government attempt to regulate an economy in the name of ..., to make it better and to improve the wellbeing of some groups of interest. He shows how those acts and policies often have unintended consequences which in many cases have derogatory effects on economy as a whole. He reminds as that as with many things there are two sides of the story, one negative and one positive.\nIf you read it then you will be able to notice deceptions and illusions which are created intentionally or not by bureaucrats and politicians and other economist.\nIt is a small refreshing book. In the end of the book you will be rewarded with a nice list of books to read.\nEveryone can read it, and that is what makes this book amazing. It was pleasure to read it because.\nIf there is a common sense then this book is full of it. You will be surprised how insightful his observations are, just enough to convey the idea without loosing someone in detail.\nSomeone in reviews wrote that this book is not about economics. That person is wrong. It`s all about economics. It is about the world in which we live and our cooperation with each other in it. It shows how that cooperation can improve our lives or not, and what has positive or negative impact on it."

    "I've tried every diet under the sun. I felt like the last thing I needed was another book, but I took a chance. I am so glad I did. This book is worth the read. It's NOT another how to diet book. Rather, it's a book about how you can get your head in the game. So many times we have the best intentions, start a new diet and fail. This book talks about how to do things differently. It was a refreshing change. The beginning was a little boring (I am not going to lie) but stick with it, it gets to a section (around chapters 5-6-7) where you have these AHHHH-HAAAAA moments. I don't usually write reviews, but definitely felt this book was worth writing a review.",
    "I purchased Chasing Cupcakes on Audible. Elizabeth Benton, the author read the book herself. This book absolutely spoke to me about the weight struggle I have been living with for years. So, I also bought the book in paperback & gave another as a gift. I also purchased a highlighter and turned this book into my workbook! This book is filled with solutions to a struggle that seemed hopeless & ongoing for me. I felt as if Elizabeth & I were sitting together having the most life changing conversation I have ever had. This book has changed me. It is transforming me. Finally, my struggle is over! I have been given my proper tools to get this job done without white knuckling it ever again. Thank you, Elizabeth! I am forever grateful for Chasing Cupcakes! Definitely 5 stars! I highly recommend it. I also follow Elizabeth on her Podcast “Primal Potential”.",
    "I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I'm a professional nutritionist and I'm someone who has struggled with her own compulsive overeating and binge eating behaviors. (Show me a nutritionist who hasn't, frankly!) This book helps the reader ask some potentially uncomfortable and difficult questions, but ones that being able to answer for ourselves will open up pathways to -- FINALLY -- *actually changing* the self-destructive behaviors we've been engaging in for years. Not just around food, but also with regard to so many other aspects of life. These are behavior change techniques that are oriented toward food but that can 100% apply to so much else in life. I cannot tell you how many \"diet books\" I've read and I've also spent countless amounts of time and money on \"self-help\" books and programs with not much to show for them. But there's something about Elizabeth's style and the way she conveys information that spoke to me in ways other things haven't. My book has lots of highlighting and dog-eared pages that are the hallmarks of a work that was/is HELPFUL and beloved, and one that I have returned to flip through multiple times -- and it has the honor of being one of very, very few books I have taken the time to read through in its entirety *twice.* I've found it so helpful for me personally, that I have since recommended it to several clients, all of whom rave about it as well.\n\nAnd I just finished reading this author's second book, Tools for the Trenches. (About to leave a review after I write this one!) If you decide to check out Chasing Cupcakes and you enjoy it, you will definitely want to get Tools for the Trenches, too -- there are even more questions to ask yourself that will help you identify the unhelpful thought patterns and unproductive behavior loops you keep yourself in -- but most importantly, finding your answers to them will help you *change* those thoughts and behaviors. If you have *wanted* \"self help\" to work for you in the past but have found it kind of hokey or phony, I would say Elizabeth Benton is the real deal. The questions she poses to you -- for you to answer for yourself, whether about food & weight loss or about pretty much anything else in your life -- just might help you finally start making some noticeable progress in things you've been trying, unsuccessfully, to change for years. It's not froo-froo or \"touchy-feely.\" It's actionable and logical and genuinely helps you feel a sense of control with regard to actually, FINALLY, making changes you have been \"trying\" to make for a long time.",
    "I have a hard time reading it because I want to highlight every line!",
    "One of my favorite books! I could read this a million times.",
    "No matter what season of life you are in this book is a GREAT purchase! It is not a book to just read and put on the shelf, you need to apply what you are learning. I also listen to her podcast and between this book and her podcast along with the work I am doing, it has changed my life for the better. You won't be disappointed with this book!",
    "Love everything. Talented lady",
    "Every.thing.is. a bullet point.\nARGGH. Very annoying to read. There must be a thousand one-sentence \"paragraphs\" in this book. It made the reading really off-putting. I could barely wade through the annoying style to get to the somewhat interesting content.",
    "Elizabeth provides a sincere, no-nonsense approach to living our best life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to break behaviour and thought patterns that no longer serve us. In fact, I would recommend this book to anyone, because we don't always recognize the thought patterns that are preventing us from shining bright. This book will open your eyes! Discovering Elizabeth’s podcasts was a gift. Listening to them and reading this book are like having a life coach with you everyday. So grateful to you Elizabeth!",
    "Very good book ! Well written and full of fantastic info ! Truly helpful for anyone struggling with diet motivation, self image, procrastination etc. This book is not just a book on how to eat better . It is a book to help transform the mind in any area of life. I listened to it first on audible and then got the hard copy because it is worth having around for to reference. Maybe even the top read in this category!",
    "I have been waiting for this book for a long time, and was not disappointed. Elizabeth's words dig deep into your soul and really help shift your mindset. There are so many amazing messages within the book, I know it will be a book I refer to over and over again. I love how there are questions at the end of the chapters that really make you take what you've just read and put it into personal practice right away. If you have been feeling stuck, don't hesitate on getting this book.",
    "Elizabeth 100% knows her stuff. I am only 100 pages into the book but couldn't wait any longer to leave my review because I wanted to make sure other people knew to get their hands on this book ASAP if they want to change their minds and their lives. I've also bought 2 copies for my sisters, and the hard part is going to be waiting to gift it to them :)\n\nEach chapter has had concrete actionable strategies to use and questions to ask yourself to wake yourself up. Not to mention, every chapter is LOADED with truth bombs. I've been highlighting like crazy. I will have a ton of golden reminders to come back to when things become challenging. You won't regret giving this book a try, especially if you're truly ready to do the work required to create lasting change."

    "I was excited to read this book as soon as I heard Cathy O'Neill, the author, interviewed on EconTalk.\n\nO'Neill's hypothesis is that algorithms and machine learning can be useful, but they can also be destructive if they are (1) opaque, (2) scalable and (3) damaging. Put differently, an algorithm that determines whether you should be hired or fired, given a loan or able to retire on your savings is a WMD if it is opaque to users, \"beneficiaries\" and the public, has an impact on a large group of people at once, and \"makes decisions\" that have large social, financial or legal impacts. WMDs can leave thousands in jail or bankrupt pensions, often without warning or remorse.\n\nAs examples of non-WMDs, consider bitcoin/blockchain (the code and transactions are published), algorithms developed by a teacher (small scale), and Amazon's \"recommended\" lists, which are not damaging (because customers can decide to buy or not).\n\nAs examples of WMDs (many of which are explained in the book), consider Facebook's \"newsfeed\" algorithm, which is opaque (based on their internal advertising model), scaled (1.9 billion disenfranchised zombies) and damaging (echo-chamber, anyone?)\n\nI took numerous notes while reading this book, which I think everyone interested in the rising power of \"big data\" (or big brother) or bureaucratic processes should read, but I will only highlight a few:\n\n* Models are imperfect -- and dangerous if they are given too much \"authority\" (as I've said)\n* Good systems use feedback to improve in transparent ways (they are anti-WMDs)\nWMDs punish the poor because the rich can afford \"custom\" systems that are additionally mediated by professionals (lawyers, accountants, teachers)\n* Models are more dangerous the more removed their data are from the topic of interest, e.g., models of \"teacher effectiveness\" based on \"student grades\" (or worse alumni salaries)\n* \"Models are opinions embedded in mathematics\" (what I said) which means that those weak in math will suffer more. That matters when \"American adults... are literally the worst [at solving digital problems] in the developed world.\"\n* It is easy for a \"neutral\" variable (e.g., postal code) to reproduce a biased variable (e.g., race)\n* Wall Street is excellent at scaling up a bad idea, leading to huge financial losses (and taxpayer bailouts). It was not an accident that Wall Street \"messed up.\" They knew that profits were private but losses social.\n* Many for-profit colleges use online advertisements to attract (and rip off) the most vulnerable -- leaving them in debt and/or taxpayers with the bill. Sad.\n* A good program (for education or crime prevention) also relies on qualitative factors that are hard to code into algorithms. Ignore those and you're likely to get a biased WMD. I just saw a documentary on urbanism that asked \"what do the poor want -- hot water or a bathtub?\" They wanted a bathtub because they had never had one and could not afford to heat water. #checkyourbias\n* At some points in this book, I disagreed with O'Neill's preference for justice over efficiency. She does not want to allow employers to look at job applicants' credit histories because \"hardworking people might lose jobs.\" Yes, that's true, but I can see why employers are willing to lose a few good people to avoid a lot of bad people, especially if they have lots of remaining (good credit) applicants. Should this happen at the government level? Perhaps not, but I don't see why a hotel chain cannot do this: the scale is too small to be a WMD.\n* I did, OTOH, notice that peer-to-peer lending might be biased against lender like me (I use Lending Club, which sucks) who rely on their \"public credit models\" as it seems that these models are badly calibrated, leaving retail suckers like me to lose money while institutional borrowers are given preferential access.\n* O'Neill's worries about injustice go a little too far in her counterexamples of the \"safe driver who needs to drive through a dangerous neighborhood at 2am\" as not deserving to face higher insurance prices, etc. I agree that this person may deserve a break, but the solution to this \"unfair pricing\" is not a ban on such price discrimination but an increase in competition, which has a way of separating safe and unsafe drivers (it's called a \"separating equilibrium\" in economics). Her fear of injustice makes me think that she's perhaps missing the point. High driving insurance rates are not a blow against human rights, even if they capture an imperfect measure of risk, because driving itself is not a human right. Yes, I know it's tough to live without a car in many parts of the US, but people suffering in those circumstances need to think bigger about maybe moving to a better place.\n* Worried about bias in advertisements? Just ban all of them.\n* O'Neill occasionally makes some false claims, e.g., that US employers offered health insurance as a perk to attract scarce workers during WWII. That was mainly because of a government-ordered wage freeze that incentivised firms to offer \"more money\" via perks. In any case, it would be good to look at how other countries run their health systems (I love the Dutch system) before blaming all US failures on WMDs.\n* I'm sympathetic to the lies and distortions that Facebook and other social media spread (with the help of WMDs), but I've gotta give Trump credit for blowing up all the careful attempts to corral, control and manipulate what people see or think (but maybe he had a better way to manipulate). Trump has shown that people are willing to ignore facts to the point where it might take a real WMD blowing up in their neighborhood to take them off auto pilot.\n* When it comes to political manipulations, I worry less about WMDs than the total lack of competition due to gerrymandering. In the 2016 election, 97 percent of representatives were re-elected to the House.\n* Yes, I agree that humans are better at finding and using nuances, but those will be overshadowed as long as there's a profit (or election) to win. * * * Can we push back on those problems? Yes, if we realize how our phones are tracking us, how GPA is not your career, or how \"the old boys network\" actually produced a useful mix of perspectives.\n* Businesses will be especially quick to temper their enthusiasm when they notice that WMDs are not nearly so clever. What worries me more are politicians or bureaucrats who believe a salesman pitching a WMD that will save them time but harm citizens. That's how we got dumb do not fly lists, and other assorted government failures.\n* Although I do not put as much faith in \"government regulation\" as a solution to this problem as I put into competition, I agree with O'Neill that consumers should own their data and companies only get access to it on an opt-in model, but that model will be broken for as long as the EULA requires that you give up lots of data in exchange for access to the \"free\" platform. Yes, Facebook is handy, but do you want Facebook listening to your phone all the time?\n\nBottom Line: I give this book FOUR STARS for its well written, enlightening expose of MWDs. I would have preferred less emphasis on bureaucratic solutions and more on market, competition, and property rights solutions.",
    "…and a book that delivers by delving into the numerous ways that mathematical algorithms impact our lives, sometimes very negatively and often without appeal. All too often the ones who formulate the algorithms view the injustices as just so much collateral damage, sacrificed on the altar of economic efficiency. At the end of the review, I’ll provide an example of my own.\n\nCathy O’Neil has a PhD in math from Harvard, taught at Barnard, decided to make three times the money by working as a “quant” on Wall Street, specifically for the hedge fund D. E. Shaw. Of the numerous wry observations she makes in the book, she compares working at D.E. Shaw to the structure of Al Qaeda. Information was tightly controlled in individual “cells.” No one (probably even the big boys) understood the entire structure which prevented someone “walking” to a rival. The financial meltdown of 2008, when suddenly the quants, and others, realized that a strawberry picker named Alberto Ramirez, making $14,000 a year, really couldn’t afford the $720,000 he financed in Rancho Grande, CA,, and therefore the “Triple A” rating on the bonds issued based on the mortgage was phony, proved to be her “Saul on the road to Damascus moment,” which eventually led to this book. (She doesn’t make the point that the damage done by the quants, in terms of lost homes and jobs, to so many Americans, was far, far greater than Al Qaeda’s wildest aspirations.)\n\nIn her book, O’Neil goes far beyond Wall Street to other segments of our society: colleges, the judicial system, insurance, advertising, employment, teacher evaluations, credit scores, and political campaigns and Facebook.\n\nConsider colleges. It was US News and World Report that dreamed up the idea of ranking colleges based on “objective” quantitative criteria. They convinced others to play along, in particular the colleges themselves. And so, from the perspective of a university President, “…they were at the summit of their careers dedicating enormous energy toward boosting performance in fifteen areas defined by a group of journalists at a second-tier news magazine.” A most important area was totally omitted: “value for money,” a standard criteria for most Amazon Vine reviews. And so, as she says, to meet these journalists’ criteria, the cost of higher education rose 500% between 1985 and 2013. She cites a couple of examples how colleges “gamed” the system. The most interesting was King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia. Its math department had been around TWO years, in 2014, when it came in 7th place in the world, behind Harvard, but ahead of MIT and Cambridge! How? It searched the professional journals for professors with the most citations, one of the criteria in the algorithm, offered the professors $72,000 a year for three weeks of work as “adjunct faculty.” Voila.\n\nIn public school teacher evaluations in the USA, O’Neil cites the example of a well-respected teacher who was fired for being in the bottom 10% in teacher evaluations. How? Apparently the teachers from the PREVIOUS year had falsified the students’ standardized testing results. The following year, when the well-respected teacher did not, it appeared to the algorithm that the students had declined. No appeal or common sense. She was fired.\n\nInsurance is a personal bugaboo with me. O’Neil confirmed what I learned the hard way. A MAJOR factor in determining the price of insurance is an algorithm that determines which customers are unlikely to switch insurance companies – and those customers are charged the most! When I finally figured this out, the hard way, a few years back, the company that famously proclaims that you can “save 15% or more” was actually willing to drop my insurance premium 30% because I was changing, which I still did, to another company that offered the same coverage for 50% less. (I’ll be changing from that company in a couple of years, of course.) (What a racket.)\n\nAnother fascinating section is on how our on-line behavior is monitored, which changes not only the ads we see, but the very news. And how much effort is expended in political campaigns on those few undecided voters in Florida and Ohio. Wow. Truly calls for the abolition of the Electoral College.\n\nFinally, my own example. I once worked for the COO of the most famous hospital in the aforementioned Saudi Arabia. He called me in one day and asked if I could do standard deviations. Thanks to Bill Gates, et al., I assured him I could readily do them. “Then please do them on all the doctors’ salaries, per department”. Again, thanks to Bill, it was done in a day. Why, oh why? It was the COO’s own “algorithm.” When he met monthly with each department Chair, to discuss physician evaluations and salary increases, there would be nothing “personal” involved. He could point to this objective report, and express his concerns about the “standard deviation” of the salaries within the department. And depending on – hum – the circumstances, he could say: I think the standard deviation is “too high” (or, of course, “too low”). The “basis” for giving out a 2 ½% or 5% salary increase. “Clever.”\n\nAs for O’Neil’s book, 5-stars, plus.",
    "Very good book . Informative and an eye opener. Excellent amount of food for thought and ver effective in raising awareness of the potential evils hidden in big data.",
    "A pop science book about algorithms. US bias in the language distracts from the message - apart from 'math' instead of 'maths' for 'mathematics', words like 'maven', 'honor roll' and 'Super PACS' (which should be 'PACs') have little relevance outside the US. Some basic errors in research, too, such as reference to \"a quality computer, like the IBM Selectric\" (page 115) and the reference to \"the British city of Kent\" (page 89) suggest a lack of deep knowledge of the subject, and the description of machine learning (pages 75-77) is superficial, failing to explain the distinction between data mining, machine learning and artifical intelligence in general. Plenty of anecdotes but not much science, some of it wrong. I was surprised to read \"BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by their height in centimetres\" (page 176). By that measure, a 6'6\" man (200 cm) could weight 5 tons (5000 kg) and be 'normal' with a BMI of 25. No wonder so many people are overweight if that's the American way. Of course, BMI is actually weight (in kg) divided by the square of height (in metres). Curiously, until the NIH redefined U.S. BMI cut-offs in 1998, LeBron James (I had to look him up) with a BMI of 26.6 would be 'normal'. Errors like that cast doubt on the rest of the book, and I wonder what else I missed.",
    "Interesting but very American based and many examples were meaningless to me in Britain.",
    "This is an easy to read book with a raft of real world examples across a range of industries from education, finance to ecommerse on where data has been mis-used and negatively impacted customers and employees. It’s an important perspective on how data can be misused and offers ideas on how we need to adapt our control & culture in an increasing data driven world.\nThe author passion for the subject can be felt through the book and although enjoyed it did leave me feeling a little saddened to see so many examples of poorly implemented analytics.\nThe book would have benefitted from a broader perspective and also included success stories to show how data can also be a force for good to simplify and improve our lives. At the end of the day these are tools and it’s how people use them that can produce these WMD’s.\nAlso reminds us of the need to educate the wider community on how data is used and that data asset needs to benefit everyone.",
    "WMD is a well-known book by now, and I have been meanin to read it for some time. It is short and easy to read. Plenty of examples from different industries, starting with finance. Cathy's experience in this and other Big Data and Data Scientist roles helps to give her message credance. She explains the examples well.\n\nIf you are looking for a really in depth text, this is not it. This is meant for everyone and in that respect it is a good book. When I started reading it I thought perhaps it could do with the Michael Lewis touch (Flashboys, Moneyball etc) but when I finished I thought not. It looks like this is the way the future looks, and it is not pretty the way it is right now. Let's hope that the technology and scale leads to greater beneifts to all, and not mass categorisation with a dumb central machine.",
    "It's a bit too much of a cheer for the sidekick if you will. Granted there are people that cannot be put in a category, but saying that models are ridiculous because they don't accomodate for the 1 in a 10000 is a bit much. Statistical significance people! I read until the end of the first case ( teacher got fired because of poorly performing kids).\n\nIt's tough luck being the 1 but it just means you will have to fight harder. It gives people the excuse to blame it on 'generalisation' and allows individuals to scream 'I am unique, you must take under account me as well!!', which in my honest opinion shows a very massive degree of selfishness and narcissism. People are amazing because we adapt and find identity in this adaptation but also respect.\n\nBook is well written though and does have examples. It just doesn't evoke positivity in me."

    "Startups without venture capital is like one hand clapping. For those not familiar with Venture Capital as an industry, its inception and evolution and role in building the U.S. innovation ecosystem, this book is a valuable addition and worth a read.\n\nThat said this book feels like it written by committee, each responsible for a third of the book.\n\nThe first third of the book, a survey of the history of venture capital to the end of the 20th century is a good overview, albeit one with a very parochial view. All of these early histories, this one included, offer a very limited perspective on the role of the military in funding/founding Silicon Valley in the midst of the Cold War. It’s not unexpected as most of those efforts are buried in projects and reports that only now are becoming declassified. But their impact was substantial on the early days of Silicon Valley. To be fair, it would be extremely difficult for academic historians who didn’t have code word clearances to understand this. So far none have.\n\nAs the second third of the book crosses into the 21st century it loses its dispassionate perspective of trying to find meaning and context and instead reads as a paean to Sequoia Capital and Accel. This might be an artifact of the narrative as the book traces the evolution of venture through the lens of individual Venture Capitalists and their firms (Patterson and Swartz, Moritz and Leone/Morritz, et al.). However, I found this section obsequious to the point you’d think the author was an investor in their funds.\n\nThe last third of the book provides valuable insight on the evolution and growth of venture capital in China. It’s one of the few coherent retrospectives about the growth of Chinese VC I’ve read.\n\nFinally, two points worth noting. The first, is that this is not a history of all of venture capital. In the 20th century most VC firms invested in all forms of technology; hardware, software and starting in the 1980’s, life sciences (therapeutics, devices and diagnostics.) But by the beginning of the 21st century most firms specialized. However in reading the book you’d have no idea that Life Science VC’s exist. Yet arguably the companies they’ve funded have provided more value to society than every social media investment ever made.\n\nAs a closing note, and this has nothing to do with the value of the book, is the authors unabashed view that venture capital is just fine as is, don’t screw with it. Yet at the end of the day venture for all it has done in creating an innovation ecosystem, is an unregulated financial asset class without any morals. It’s equally happy funding Apple and Moderna (Covid Vaccines) as it has Juul (addicting teens to tobacco) or Facebook (the Purdue Pharma of social media.)\n\nWorth a read.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author made the history and evolution of Venture Capital very readable and understandable. The book also provides insights into the thinking and personalities of the prime movers of Silicon Valley. As an aside the author illustates how unlikeable Marl Zuckerberg is as when he showed up to a VC meeting in his pajamas. That is what you call chutzpah or is it arrogance? No wonder Sheryl Sandberg quit. She has no chance of helping this guy.",
    "This is an extremely useful book for someone like me, who knew very little about Venture Capital and Silicon Valley. It explains the Valley's history and its business dynamics very clearly, authoritatively and rigorously. I hope the author writes updates in the future -- I'd love to hear him continue describing VC's unfolding story. The best part about Mallaby is his modesty; he acknowledges the randomness of a firm's success and failure, and is neither uncritical nor hypercritical of VC and tech in general. It's so rare and terrific to read someone who presents wonderfully reported topics without drinking the Kool-Aid nor hating the game and/or the players.",
    "This book is probably the best at accurately describing how VCs work, at least based on my experience working with VCs. I strongly believe in the value that VCs provide and I have been somewhat awed by the whole VC ecosystem in Silicon Valley that allows someone like myself, a fresh grad with no industry experience, to receive funding and start a company. This book shows how that VC ecosystem developed over the years and continues to make dreams possible.",
    "Excellent read on the history of venture capital and how it came to be in its current iteration. Highly recommend.",
    "Well written",
    "This book is a tour de force, combining great stories with deep insight, informed by the academic literature and author's own considerable expertise, that does the best job I have seen explaining the various stages in VC and the nature of the unique contribution of VC to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Absolute must read by all entrepreneurs, as well as policy makers and the larger public seeking to understand the dynamics behind disruptive innovation. Also brilliantly written",
    "Deeply researched, this book is a comprehensive and thoroughly enjoyable tale of the history of venture capital. Studded with delightful, often jaw-dropping anecdotes, the book simultaneously spins these fun yarns while it makes a deeper point about the little-examined role VC plays in theories of economic growth and the commercialization of scientific discoveries. Sebastian Mallaby is a master storyteller with a keen eye for the telling detail, a playful sense of humor, and a sharp intellect that cuts through the conventional wisdom to reveal deeper insights.",
    "I have been working in the tech industry for 20 years and learned so much from this fantastic book. Mallaby entertains as much as he informs, bringing the characters he discusses to life with anecdotes and stories peppered throughout. As such, The Power Law is an excellent read, deftly explaining the fascinating history of Venture Capital. It's a must-read if you want to better understand how Silicon Valley became what it is today, what we can learn from that in the rest of the world, how VC has evolved, how Venture Capitalists think and why VC investing is so different from traditional finance, and the impact VC has had on society.",
    "A nice account of the complex dealings in Silicon Valley.\n\nHow there was a kind of equality for the gifted and mostly highly qualified people that new projects needed. Some were also self-taught and had no formal qualifications, but had proved their talents. Looking after them was part of the process.\n\nHe does not mention the bad treatment of those who were not particularly needed, like Amazon warehouse staff. The book also fails to give details of how the three basics - advanced electronics, the package-switching for the internet and the easy-to-use hyperlinks of the World Wide Web - were all pioneered by rather different people. And made with public money and no thought of profit, either for military research or particle physics at CERN, where Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.\n\nNor does he notice that the gigantic profits going to a few people have no clear benefit to the society as a whole. Allowing for a population increased by vast numbers of immigrants, the USA grew no faster after the changes begun by Reagan than it had before.\n\nBut what it does say is interesting and informative. Some of the human stories have the same fascination as the early episodes of Dallas, or even The Sopranos.\n\nDefinitely a book you need to read.",
    "An excellent historical, eye-opening and well-written account of the rising influential role of VC in the US and globally. The book is easy to follow, well-structured and full of amusing anecdotes about the early days of Facebook, Google, Amazon etc before they became world-famous, and the VCs who helped to shape and build their future. A highly enjoyable book!",
    "This is not a good book, it is the best book on investing and what it takes to build a culture of successful investing I have ever read. Well researched, thorough, even-handed, thoughtful and also a good read. Well done Sebastian.",
    "An essential history for anyone working in the VC/Start Up world."

    "When I first became aware of the stock market in 1960, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 679. By the beginning of 2022, the index had topped 36,000. Even discounting inflation, today’s Dow Jones average is five and a half times as high as it was just over 60 years ago. Of course, economic growth accounts for a substantial portion of that increase. But the government’s easy money policies over the past decade have been even more important. The years since the Great Recession of 2007-9 have seen nearly two-thirds of the increase. But, as Christopher Leonard takes pains to point out in The Lords of Easy Money, the central question to ask about this explosive rise is what lawyers are taught to ask: Who benefits? And, unless you have substantial holdings in the stock market or real estate, the answer to that question is, Not us.\n\nSETTING THE STAGE FOR TODAY’S VOLATILE SECURITIES MARKETS\nLeonard sketches out the historical circumstances that led to the Great Recession. Focusing on the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, he describes the draconian measures Fed Chairman Paul Volcker (1927-2019) used to break the back of inflation in the early 1980s. He then follows Volcker’s successor, Alan Greenspan (1926-), through the two decades of his chairmanship (1987-2006). Greenspan’s policies, as the man himself admitted, lay the groundwork for the Great Recession. But the focus in The Lords of Easy Money is squarely on developments within the Fed after the Great Recession. Among the central figures in the book are Greenspan’s three immediate successors: Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and Jerome Powell. But the hero, if that word isn’t too much of a stretch, is a retired member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Thomas Hoenig.\n\nTWO RISKY POLICIES\nThe central thesis of this book is straightforward. During the Great Recession and the years that followed, the Federal Reserve Board adopted unprecedented policies that drowned the US economy in a tidal flood of cash. They did so in two ways, which represented the major components of the easy money policies of the 2010s. First, by dropping the ground-floor interest rate nearly to zero and keeping it there. This policy lasted so long that it even acquired an acronym: ZIRP, for Zero Interest Rate Policy. And, second, by engaging in quantitative easing (QE), which committed the Fed to purchase large quantities of bonds; the effect of this policy was to increase further—and dramatically so—the cash balances held by the nation’s major banks.\n\nFor many years, one man who served from time to time on the Federal Open Market Committee stood opposed to these policies. Thomas Hoenig (1946-), President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was often a lonely voice, one vote out of twelve. It’s worth quoting Leonard at length to understand why.\n\nWHY TOM HOENIG OPPOSED THESE POLICIES\n“Hoenig was fighting against quantitative easing because he knew that it would create historically huge amounts of money, and this money would be delivered first to the big banks on Wall Street. He believed that this money would widen the gap between the very rich and everybody else. It would benefit a very small group of people who owned assets, and it would punish the very large group of people who lived on paychecks and tried to save money. Just as important, this tidal wave of money would encourage every entity on Wall Street to adopt riskier and riskier behavior in a world of cheap debt and heavy lending, potentially creating exactly the kind of ruinous financial bubble that had caused the Global Financial Crisis in the first place.” Many commentators misinterpreted Hoenig’s views as knee-jerk fear of inflation. But that was not a major consideration for him.\n\nLeonard adds, “As it turned out, Hoenig was almost entirely correct in his concerns and his predictions. . . Understanding what the Fed did in November 2010 is the key to understanding the very strange economic decade that followed, when asset prices soared, the stock market boomed, and the American middle class fell further behind.”\n\nWHERE DID ALL THOSE TRILLIONS GO?\nIn Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World, investigative journalist Peter S. Goodman describes the outcome of these policies more dramatically: “In the decade following the financial crisis, the companies that made up the S&P 500, a broad swath of the American stock market, spent $5.3 trillion—or more than half their profits—to buy back their stock, sending their share prices higher. They spent another $3.8 trillion on handing out dividends. Over the course of those ten years, the wealth of American billionaires increased by more than 80 percent. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Americans were still waiting for the recovery.”\n\nSURPRISINGLY, A READABLE ACCOUNT\nFew topics are as boring to the general reader as economic policy. Like contemporary specialists in every field, economists and bankers have a language all their own. When they speak or write about their work, they’re likely to confuse much more than they elucidate. The jargon is often impenetrable. But Christopher Leonard is used to it. In years of reporting on business and economics, he has gained remarkable skill at translating even the most obscure argot into lucid English. At times, the policies involved are so complex that even he (and the reader) falter. Still, nearly throughout, The Lords of Easy Money is remarkably readable. If you want to get a handle on the pivotal role the Federal Reserve Board holds in the world’s economic affairs, this book will do the trick for you.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nThe Lords of Easy Money is Christopher Leonard‘s third book. His previous books were The Meat Racket and Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America. An investigative journalist, Leonard is a graduate of the University of Missouri Journalism School. He currently serves as director of the Missouri School of Journalism Reynolds Journalism Institute.",
    "John Feltner lived in Dallas Texas was laid off and determined to get a job at Rexnord, he drove 15 hours to Milwaukee for an interview. He got the job, but was eventually laid off again because Rexnord decided to move its production line to Mexico. To add insult to injury, Feltner was offered a temporary reprieve so that he could train the Mexicans. He declined. The financial and social woes of the Feltner family are just a microcosm of the state of USA today. What then, is the big picture? That is what this book by Leonard is all about.\n\nIt explains in simple, accessible language, complex economic problems that has mired the American economy for decades. Leonard pins the blame on the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the USA (‘the Fed’). It is accountable to no one – not even Congress – yet it wields all the power that shapes the US economy. According to Leonard, the ZIRP, or ‘Zero Interest Rate Policy’ adopted by the Fed, in a nutshell, has been enriching the top 1% of America’s population, and driving the bottom, and the middle-class like the Feltners, deeper and deeper into financial impoverishment.\n\nIn a fascinating account, Leonard explains the bizarre ZIRP policy that drives investors away from safe investments like Treasury bonds, because of zero interest, and into riskier investments where the returns are higher. The second act of the Fed is the habit of ‘quantitative easing’, the process of printing and pumping money into the economy such that the banks, hedge funds, and investors have too much cash and no where to go (the Treasury bonds have low yield, remember?) so they are all channelled to risky investments. What are they? They are investments in high asset value stocks. The problem is that the high asset values are mostly artificially created.\n\nRexnord, for example, is a company that manufactures engineering goods such as ball bearings for aeroplanes. But, the new management found that by cost-cutting (closing departments and laying off workers), and concentrating on the paper restructuring of its debts then selling them off, the company keeps rolling in profits – without actually expanding its physical business.\n\nWhere will all this lead to, and how will it end? Leonard is not optimistic. If his analysis is correct, America has plenty to worry about. Those who have some money to invest may worry about the bubble. When it bursts, there will be lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth. Leonard ends thus: ‘The long crash of 2008 had evolved into the long crash of 2020. The bills had yet to be paid.’",
    "An insightful book severely compromised by Mr Leonard's frequent digressions into Trump hating, perpetuating the discredited official Coronavirus narrative and election-fraud denial, none of which are really relevant to the subject at hand. Presumably he wants to appease his patrons at The New York Times and Washington Post.",
    "Leonard does a decent job in describing the decisions the Fed made in the free money era. I'm a professional investor, I lived through all these activities, but I still learned something.\n\nI'd prefer fewer anecdotes, more hard data, but that's not really the point of the book.",
    "Absolutely fascinating account of US central bank policies over the last few decades and the distortions these policies create in the markets and society as a whole. Certainly not the conclusion of the author but many people reading this book will invariably come to the same conclusion that I did - bitcoin fixes this!",

    "Gran libro. Perfectamente explica el roll de la FED y cómo imprimir dinero solo nos llevará de una crisis a otra sin saber qué alguna de ellas nos alejará cada vez de valores reales y creará más caos e inestabilidad social y económica. Podría ser que COVID 19 solo evidenció lo débil del sistema financiero y la distancia que se encuentra una recesión verdadera."

    "Bottom Line Up Front: Very well written book that covers an important topic – Burnout in ministry. Scazzero also covers a range of other important topics in Christian leadership (e.g. use of power, navigating endings and beginnings) that the rest of the body of Christian leadership literature is nearly devoid of, making this an important reference work. So why a 4 star instead of a 5 star review? The book comes dangerously close and at one point to the idolatry line in the discussion of marriage (flirting with spousal worship). Additionally, in the same discussion section the book gets a little quirky in a short anecdote regarding nakedness (i.e. literally taking all your clothes off daily in the presence of your spouse for 20 min), hinting at use of this practice as a marriage building daily discipline. Finally, as the book is primarily written for an audience of Christian leaders, I found it light on biblical underpinning. Not devoid, just light. There were many missed opportunities to shine the light of scripture on much of what Scazzero provides, leaving the impression that the book is more an assembly of well-informed Christian opinion and experience rather than a work built solidly on biblical foundations. This necessarily removes some of the authority of the assertions. If you are able to look past these things you will likely rate the book, as many have - a 5 star work, and enjoy it greatly.\n\nAmplifying Remarks follow:\n\nThe basic premise of the book is that many in full (or nearly so) vocational ministry are overworked, burned out, in marriages that are running on fumes, consumed with busyness unable to rest, and physically, emotionally, and spiritually exhausted. Working full time in vocational ministry myself, this is an assertion I see (and have occasionally experienced) being lived out on the front lines of ministry every day. Thus, I feel like this is a book that finds an easy audience, willing to listen. Much of the rest of the book is about unpacking solutions to this root issue. The basic approach is finding and sustaining life and ministry rhythms to replace these unhealthy practices that lead to burnout. Drawing on a number monastic traditions Scazzero makes a case for the practice of spiritual disciplines, (silence, solitude, deep engagement in alone times with God, prayer, rest, sabbath keeping, etc) as helpful in breaking these unhealthy cycles and patterns. The author suggests breaking these cycles by transforming the inner life and allowing this transformed inner life to drive new healthy patterns and outward expressions as Christian leaders lead others from this new place of balance. The book suggests that inner life transformation begins with the practice of four key elements which are:\n\n-Face Your Shadow (Unhealthy practice, perhaps shaped by your family of origin, that often shapes your interactions with others)\n- Lead out of Your Marriage/Singleness (exactly as it sounds)\n- Slow down for Loving Union (Taking time to relax, abide in Christ, and let Him take on the heavy lifting that you have so desperately been trying to control)\n-Practice Sabbath Delight (Again….exactly as it sounds)\n\nOne endearing aspect of this book throughout is that the book doesn’t just mention ideas but rather puts meat to them by laying out several useable and practical suggestions about how to make each a regular pattern in a new transformed inner life. This section is certainly no exception.\n\nI particularly liked the section within the inner life discussion where Scazzero presents the idea of establishing a “Rule of Life”. This “Rule of Life” concept is taken from the practices of the Benedictine Monastic tradition and involves an exercise in finding, giving, and receiving God’s love across the full spectrum of life as viewed through four separate lenses: Prayer, Rest, Relationships, and Work. Very practical and very well presented.\n\nThe chapter on “Finding Sabbath Delight”, is also practical, excellent, and much needed. My own observation (and Scazzero’s) is that the practice of regular sabbath keeping seems to have nearly disappeared from the 21st century Church, especially in North America. Sadly, this has taken a toll on those who lead it. This section of the book, if truly widely practiced, would do much to restore that.\n\nIn part II of the book (The Outer Life) I was most grateful for the author’s inclusion of some practical information on the use of power in ministry and the very thoughtful and practical approaches he outlines to healthy “endings” and “new beginnings”. His approach to these obscure but very important topics, and the manner and lucidity with which he presents them, make it clear that his wise recommendations have been formed in the crucible of highly successful experience – a reward not many can claim. As stated above, these are just topics which you rarely find even mentioned in other books on Christian leadership, so there inclusion here is most helpful.\n\nFinally, the quote that best speaks to what this book is really about: “You can’t live at warp speed, without warping your soul”. Pg. 129.\n\nIn light of that this book is ultimately about a much needed “unwarping the soul” among Church leadership!",
    "We used this book in our Bible study and it is very worth it.",
    "Man, I highly recommend this to anyone in a leadership position! Such a great tool and it is very convicting and challenging!",
    "Loved easy to understand and self-evaluation. Definitely something to read for a leader.",
    "You need to read this book",
    "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PFC9MR0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6\n\nWow is all I can say!\n\nAs a pastor and someone who has been in ministry over 20 years, I often find new materials and studies that completely blow my mind. Many times God uses these materials to convict and grow me in new ways, causing me to re-evaluate my walk with Him, and the way I do ministry. As a church staff, we recently watched this video series, and took several weeks to go through the \"Emotionally Healthy Spirituality\" small group curriculum, and it was life changing.\n\nI don't know that for me there were many areas that I was unaware of, as far as struggles, sins, etc...but God used this study to really help me delve into things that I had put aside, forgotten, or simply didn't want to touch. Peter Scazzero does an amazing job with telling his own story of life and ministry struggles, and in a very relational way, walks with you on the journey to becoming a healthy leader.\n\nI purchased this book for Kindle, after I had been through the group study with our staff, and while many of the concepts are similar, these one deals with \"leader\" specific topics. I cannot recommend this book enough, both for current leaders, church staff, those who are looking to serve in ministry or the workplace, even just an individual who wants to grow in their walk. What an amazing and heart-opening read.\n\nPick up a copy today...better yet, get two, and give one to someone else!",
    "This book is transformational to leadership and supervision of employees and volunteers. It shows leaders how to go deep instead of wide. The concepts are easy to understand, with some quickly actionable items. Other concepts will take time and intentional life choices each day. The work is worth it.",
    "I absolutely recommend this book! It has been one of the most impactful books I've read. It is a difficult read, but if you take your time to really work through it, it will be transformative for you. I recommend going through it with a friend or two, and then discussing after each chapter.",
    "My journey through this book oscillated between finding it very helpful and insightful, while at other times i struggled and even put the book down for long periods.\nOne challenge is that it is written primarily for church leaders. I felt it could have sought to have broader application. At other times the book made\nme feel entirely inadequate as a leader... So had to take breaks to recalibrate myself.\nHowever, there was much that was very helpful. The emphasis on rest (Sabbath), balance and preparing for transition were all very helpful. The book is full of practical examples which, although almost exclusively from church context, do earth the principles in reality.\nIt is a book I will recommend to people and my own team - which is why I give it a good rating inspire if some of my comments above.",
    "Brilliant book. Thank you for writing this book. It is written for people in church leadership, primarily, but as someone who isn't (directly), I took so much away from it. So many helpful illustrations, examples, challenges and new perspectives. Probably my best book I've read this year!",
    "These were bought to use for the leadership team in the church. Something for us to read together and work through on a regular basis.\n\nFor me, it's a similar theme to other stories of the same genre that I've read previously, but as with all books, something always jumps up and grabs you or your attention.\n\nIt's a good read.",
    "This is a life changing book I believe and relationship enhancing one as It did really make a great impact and awakening aspect into my perspective with handling vertical and horizontal relationship as a whole.\nI was enrolled in Fundamentals of Leadership snd this book by Peter Zcazzero was one of our reference. I did appreciate and agreed to all his insights and sharing and I got wowed!\nAs a result, I bought one too for my Sister in law who is as well a Pastor so she could use it for her teachings whenever needed.\nGreat book that everyone should have if intending to have a purposely and life changing relationship towards everyone. Worth the price so to speak.",
    "A friend recommended this book and I'm so glad she did. Very thought provoking and has changed the way i view 'Sabbath delight' i have since purchased 2 copies for some friends"

    "Tim, if you're reading this, I have a great idea for you at the end of this review. No sarcasm, no snark.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am a Tim Ferriss apologist. I've listened to almost every episode of his podcast. Own his books. Have been following him since 4 Hour Work Week came out.\n\nTim's podcast has rewired my brain. My life is measurably better because of what I've learned. Literally. I have hereditary cholesterol problems and my forays into a ketogenic lifestyle dropped my particle count from ~1950 to ~1225. There are many other great things that have come as a result of my exposure to Tim's podcast, too many to list here.\n\nWhen he announced TOOLS OF TITANS, I was ecstatic. I pre-ordered this book in September.\n\nI'm sad to say that I'm non-plussed, borderline disappointed.\n\nOn one hand, I love having a \"totem\" of something that has changed my life so profoundly. To that end, I am happy to own the book.\n\nOn the other hand, it does not deliver on its promise. This is supposedly a \"recipe book\" (according to page xvi in the Foreword).\n\nIt is no such thing.\n\nIf I want to bake an apple pie, I go to the Table of Contents, I look up apple pie, I turn to that page.\n\nYou cannot do that in this book.\n\nTim has amazing things to say about meditation. A few guests on his podcast have amazing things to say about meditation (Sam Harris, Naval Ravikant, Kevin Rose, etc.).\n\nBut there is no central place to which you can turn to find out the collected wisdom of the many guests who have delved into this topic.\n\nThe same goes for investing. The same goes for particular health hacks.\n\nIn fact, there's not even one central place in the book that gives a list of the commonalities between the guests. That's a HUGE missed opportunity.\n\nTHE ADVICE:\n\nMake a second edition. Soon. It doesn't even have to add new content. Just tighten this up and make it so that you can read about certain topics in a centralized place. If there are parts that don't fit, maybe have an author section at the back... but, dang.\n\nFINAL THOUGHT:\nMillionaires become millionaires (in part) because they've learned to say \"no.\" They have the discipline to turn down the good, so that they can pursue (and achieve) the great.\n\nThis book is just too too too much good. It doesn't tell you what is great. It will leave you chasing dozens upon dozens of random tactics and thoughts in a dozen different fields.\n\nIt might teach the tactics and routines and habits of world-class performers, but there's FAR TOO MUCH here to make it valuable in showing YOU how to achieve those heights. And, if there is ONE person that you could model to become like them in their field... there is FAR TOO LITTLE here to actually help you on your way.",
    "I've read so much success literature and most authors managed to squeeze 3 pages into 300.\n\nTim's work 'Tools of Titans' does the opposite and is one of the most - SCRATCH THAT IT IS THE MOST calorically dense advice/insight/tools written works I have ever read.\n\nI know some of the 'Titans' he references (ex: Tony Robbins - long ago my wife an I used to help volunteer staff his programs) I say this not as 'Heck yah! I KNOW these guys' ... No, it is in a wonderful way that I can read something about and from someone I know AND STILL COME AWAY WITH A NEW INSIGHT!\n\nSO HERE IS MY SELF APPOINTED CHALLENGE:\n\nAs I read, re-read, jumped around, highlighted, underlined and feel asleep and woke up thinking about all that I found in Tim's book ... I felt had I MUST do this.\n\nBackground: I have been diagnosed with Parkinson's from exposure to Agent Orange and/or toxic water from Camp Lejeune. I have had multiple TBI. I have had 21 surgeries and ... my cervical spine is exhibiting the same signs as it did prior to my last (and botched) cervical spine surgery. I weigh 292 lbs ... though my caloric intake, according to Myfitnesspal dot come should be showing a 1.5 lb/week loss ... and yet, I have gained 60 some lbs in the past year.\n\n(if you are the impatient type skip the next few paragraphs as this is background info)\n\nMy local Medical doctors shrug and either tell me 'Don't worry about it' - shorthand for dude, you are so SCREWED that ain't gonna be what gets ya!' OR they insist I am overeating despite my willingness to show them my nutrition logs.\n\nI even went to Mayo clinic this past June ... a process that took 3 months to book. My wife and I sat down with the Doc on my first day and he liked at us like 'What the ____ are you doing here?\" He cleared his throat and said \"Well, I'm leaving for Germany in 6 hours to give a speech' (anyone know german cuss words to describe this ?)\n\nSo, somewhat discouraged I shuffled down for my blood draw and then went to scheduling to see what tests I had for the rest of my scheduled week.\n\nHave you ever watched someone squirm when they have to give you really bad news ... but don't know how to say it? That was my experience watching the Lady at Mayo Clinic assigned to give me my week's schedule. The poor woman looked like a 2nd grader that had a seriously full bladder squirming in their seat.\n\nShe kept looking around to see if ANYONE could/would relive her of telling us and on realizing \"Nope, i gotta tell this guy to go poo in his hat' she blurted out \"YOUR NEXT APPOINT FOR THIS WEEK IS SCHEDULED FOR .... AUGUST 2ND\"\n\nThat was on Tuesday June 7th. August was a TEENSY BIT LONGER THAN I WAS PREPARED TO SPEND WAITING IN THEIR WAITING ROOM!\n\nBottom line: Traditional Medicine has written me off. Which is fine ... as I have written them off too!\n\n************** if you were skipping paragraphs please rejoin us here ********************\n\nGood people of the Amazonian reading tribe ... I have to STRIKE THAT ... I MUST DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT\n\nOR ... I WILL DIE.\n\nThat is not hyperbole. That is not exaggeration. I believe this to be fact.\n\nI placed photos of my scale ... and of my medicines (blurry so no label info shows) I take 21 some meds/day. Yes ... wayyyy too many! I am a 'pill-serf'\n\nIF DO NOT CHANGE THE PROCESS OF HOW I FEED, CARE FOR AND PROVIDE FOR THIS PHYSICAL BODY I WILL NOT LIKELY INHABIT IT MUCH LONGER.\n\nTo that end, I pledge I will start blogging and logging my results as I work through Tim's 'Tools of Titans'.\n\n(Talk about go BIG or go home ... yeah? precisely!)\n\nThe blog will be named That Lonesome Road dot ____ (apologies if Amazon thinks this is promotional, I seek to serve not promote and ask you allow me to do this in a way that meets your standards) and I invite any and all of you to join me as I do my all to save my life and insure my Music does not go to my grave unplayed.\n\nI pledge:\n1. I will be brutally honest.\n2. If I feel the desire to hold back from fear of ____ ... then I know I am on the right path.\n3. I will keep an honest record and tell you if what I have done works ... and if not whether I think I was the reason or no.\n4. I am doing this to hold myself accountable NOT seek notoriety. If I sound like a pompous jerk please let me know.\n5. I will do one of the hardest things I rarely do - I will ask for help.\n6. Though the subject is ... well, it ain't Sunshine and Roses ... I pledge to have a sense of humor about this!\n7. I will say Please; Thank You; I am Sorry; Will be on Time; & Will finish what I start. Genuine good manners, Graciousness, and Accountability are very scarce these days. I pledge I will embody that ... or you have my complete permission to take a whiz in my cup of ...\n\nThank you Tim for writing this and capturing these insights.\n\nThank you to all who contributed.\n\nThank you to all who read this - I pray it is of service.\n\nDS",
    "Folks, I'm an admirer of Tim Ferriss and listen to his podcast with interest and really admire his style of conducting his conversations with his guests. However while a podcast a radio program or perhaps even tv/video program is good format for the kind of content that Tim Ferriss and his guests cover, that certainly is not content worthy of a book - particularly if at the back of it the author does not hesitate to call himself a published author. I have lot of respect for Tim Ferriss as a result of his podcasts and content he's covered there, but just to take transcripts of those chats and publish as a book doesn't suit this otherwise worthy/intelligent man.",
    "I am a huge fan of Tim Ferris and I really waited for this book to launch in India and the wait is worth it. if you really wanna learn about the mindset of successful people then you must read this.\nThis book not only tells you how to be successful by financial side but it tells you how to be rich in knowledge and health. you can see some personal recommendations by the persons who are at the top level in this field.\nthis book is different from all the other books, this book is not like you can read continuously in a week or so, this book contains podcasts summaries which you can read each day/week and it has sections divided in it. you can read something of where you are a lack in.\nthe best thing I love about this book that it contains personal book recommendation from the peoples whose podcasts are written there.\nin the end, i just want to say definitely buy and read this book and trust me you gonna love it.",
    "I loved this book.But this is not a book for you if you don't like learning from other people's mistakes.Its one of those books where you love the disclaimer, forward, index and 600 plus pages of everything.\nIn the disclaimer, Tim Ferris tells you to consult a common sense specialist and not to blindly follow the book.While many topics may be controversial and the advice borderline, what cannot be ignored is the unique nature of the book.There is 111 famous men and women in the book sharing their experience with health, wealth and wisdom.A good chance of standing on the shoulders of giants.\nMust read if you have plans to make a billion or two(no harm dreaming)!",
    "First Tim Ferris book that I’ve read and I’m honestly struggling to get into it. Very unstructured with him telling you go to page 344 for this and then page 522 to complete it. If you are into trying a new coffee mixed with 9 minutes of breathing techniques followed by stretches and mantras in the morning this is your book. Thought this book would be gold but it doesn’t let you delve into it enough when you find someone or chapter you like. It really is just highlights of the podcast. Also it is rather contradictive between people on what they do/opinions but I suppose it’s to let you compare and try for yourself.\n\nWas looking forward to reading more about Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tony Robbins etc but it doesn’t go deep enough into it. Save your money and just focus on the podcasts involving such people that does interest you.\n\nGave up on this book half way through due to the nature of it. I wouldn’t recommend it.\nGoing to try the 4 hour Work Week as it’s his biggest title but surely can’t be worse than this book.",
    "I have run my own business for 2 years. I have read hundreds of books, in that time, made loads of mistake, but thankfully grown to do well.\n\nHad I had this book from the start, I would have been where I am now within a year, avoided half the mistakes and saved a lot of time. Really recommend to anyone who wants to gain a range of advice covering business, development and most importantly I think outlook on things.\n\nVery good. If Tony Robbins was the King, Tim Ferriss has become a very able prince."

    "This was a great book and very easy to digest. I gleaned a lot of useful information I otherwise never would have considered.",
    "As I read this book, I found myself agreeing with almost everything. It was a nice format to place the concepts into a digestible structure. However, I didn’t really learn anything new. I did perhaps get some insight on how to execute on some of the things I am passionate about.",
    "This book was very informative and applicable in the understanding of adaptive change in leadership and how it is necessary for change and challenges in the workforce.",
    "This book is very good in explaining the purpose and practice of adaptive leadership. I person looking to build knowledge purpose for adaptive problems could get value from this book.",
    "I was drawn in by the opening lines, \"If you want to help your organization, your community, and your society thrive in a changing world. . . . If you want to mobilize greater progress. . . If you want to strengthen your practice of leadership. . . if you want to help others strengthen their capacity. . . . this book is about possibility\" (p. 1). Talk about a book opener that draws you in head shaking a resounding YES! (grin). The authors continued to say, \"Adaptive leadership is an approach to making progress on the most important challenges you face. . . \" (p. 3).\n\nI loved this book. Practical, clear layout and presentation of materials, challenging, and hopeful. The thing is - this is not about abstraction, this is about personal responsibility, commitment, courage, and action. If you see something that needs to be done, what are you doing about it?!\n\nThe book is organized into 5 parts:\n1. Introduction: purpose and possibility - you are provided with instructions on how to use the book along with the theoretical underpinnings and background\n2. Diagnosis: The system, the adaptive challenge, and the political landscape. Characteristics of an adaptive organization are identified\n3. System Mobilization - Interpretation and Analysis, Interventions, political capital and actions, conflict, and building an adaptive culture\n4. Seeing yourself - knowing yourself, clarify who you are, what you stand for, and your purposes\n5. Deploy yourself - this is the personal responsibility part, connect to your purposes, engage courageously, inspire others, take risks, and thrive.\n\nIt's a wonderful book for self reflection and personal growth; it's a wonderful book for leaders wanting to examine leadership and see their organization anew.",
    "Is it by force?",
    "This book is filled with the deeper insights of leadership, thriving through change, tools and strategies as well as basic humanity and compassion. Deep, well-organized and accessible although dense and rich, Adaptive Leadership is the deep nutrition that will move both you and your organization forward. This is not “pop leadership” like Brendon Burchard, Richard Sheridan or even John Maxwell - it’s a book that will require time, dedication and reflection to digest. So, if you are looking for the cheap seats and pre-fab BS then stay far away. If you are ready to embrace experimentation, ambiguity, deep values and personal and organizational resistance and challenges, then get on board. Easily one of the greatest leadership books ever written. A true ethos and a way of being and maps to get there are what you’ll find here.",
    "This book is a must lead for anyone involved with leadership. The insights in it especially about the difference between adjustment challenges and technical problems are just vital for any leader. I would thoroughly recommend this book and it should be widely read",
    "Seriously. Buy this. An invaluable tool for rethinking leadership and approaching change.",

    "Such a great book for understanding Critical Thinking. Break’s it down into easily digested parts. Loved it.",
    "The authors of this book took a complicated subject and did not simplify but dumbed it down as to make the understanding of logical fallacies, reasoned arguments, and the like ambiguous and useless. If you want to read a book that covers these ideas, from basically the father of logical reasoning, then I suggest: Aristotle for Everybody: Difficult Thought Made Easy by Mortimer Adler. This book was a waste of time and money.",
    "Do you believe you know how to think critically? Think again. This book brings classical instruction to a modern audience. In a very succinct and straightforward way, the author tells you what critical thinking really is and what it is not. Read the text slowly, do the action steps and thought exercises and you'll never approach information or decisions the same way again. The author says, \"Critical thinking is an essential component of human progress. Without questioning authority and common wisdom, the science and progress we have today would be impossible.\" In the age of sound bites and information overload, this is critical (pun intended).",

    "How do you cover 50 years and make everyone happy? Well they did a pretty good job of it. Yes, some of my favorites weren't there or just a brief mention, but this is not a book to pass on. Yes, the text gets a little fluffy, but hey, it's Disney. Great mix of photos with one little quibble. They blurred faces in crowd shots. Probably a legal thing, but have not seen that before.

    "A beautiful book full of gorgeous photos of the parks, both currently and formerly, and some rarely seen photos of the land before it was developed into it's magical state. As someone who has read a lot on the history of Walt Disney World, I was surprised to find even new facts and stories - a must for any fan!",
    "Waited for this book to be back instock. Beautiful book. Great for WDW fans!",
    "I ordered this for a friend who is obsessed with Disney World and he loved it!",
    "This will be the last high value book I order from Amazon. As with The Art of The Mandalorian last year, Amazon are inept at protecting heavy books. Last year they out it in a jiffy bag, this year a standard cardboard envelope, which meant the book arrived with a torn cover!\nThe book itself is beautiful, informative, and as gorgeous as you would expect. Buy it, but not from Amazon.",
    "This book has been much anticipated, I’ve had it on pre order since it was announced. I have to say from first impressions it was definitely worth the wait. The content is well researched (even including footnotes and bibliography) and the photographs are stunning. A true celebration of the last 50 years of Disney World history. As others on here have mentioned my book arrived with a dented corner due it being inadequately packaged - but I have picked this up separately with amazon as it is no reflection of the quality of the book and the contents itself.",
    "This is a Disney 50th Anniversary item bought for a Disney fan. Considering the value of the item I was surprised by the minimal packaging provided and hence the package was damaged. The corners were crumpled which due to the thin packaging, damaged the corners of the dust cover of the book. Very disappointed, I've seen better protective packaging on makeup.",
    "This book is not a patch on the book \"Walt Disney's Disneyland\" by Chris Nichols, although both books are of similar size. If you want a book about the Disney parks , then the Disneyland book is the one to get.\nBoth parks have a lot in common, although Walt Disney World has Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios and water parks as well.\nWhilst the Disneyland book is sumptuously peppered with large (many page-size) photos, the Walt Disney World book is filled with a great many mainly tiny pictures. With the Disneyland book you really get a feel for the atmosphere and the magic. With the Walt Disney World book it's more like reading a comic with text. The magic just doesn't shine through. I know what a magical place Walt Disney World is, and I'm afraid this book doesn't do it justice.",
    "Beautiful book, it's just a shame it arrived damaged, I would have expected such expensive heavy book to be in better packaging than shoved in the standard cardboard wrap."

    "Banaji, Mahzarin, & Greenwald, Anthony (2016). Blindspot: Hidden biases of good people. New York: Bantam Books. The authors developed the IAT, Implicit Assocation Test, which purports to show hidden biases, including “implicit racism.” What it really measures, however, is a surrogate, delayed response time. Even if this is accurately measured, it is not really a surrogate for racism, as it would measure only response and not chosen behavior.\nThe concept of IMPLICIT or Institutional RACISM is wrong, and derives from materialism / Marxism /Communism, and their rejection of individual responsibility and truth, and false/incorrect ideas about human nature and action. “Implicit racism” is alleged to exist when there is no evidence of actual racism, or evidence to the contrary.\nIn my 20s, raised Catholic, I was for my sins condemned to read to the end every book I started, including the works of Karl Marx. I also read about him, and spend long days and nights being lectured to about Marx and his wonders. These friends and “teachers” all predicted the imminent, inevitable, self-destruction of free market capitalism. I was invited to entire weekend discussions devoted to Marx and his works, and his successors, which it was preached and taught as dogma.\nLater, I also came to read great writers who took Marx to pieces and pointed out his dishonesty, broken promises, awful personal life, and inconsistencies or outright lies in his works. I was also insulated against Marxism / Communism /Socialism because of Captive Europe, Europe behind the Iron Curtain, and stories of life in Communist USSR, the satellite countries, Red China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Cuba, and so on. I grew up among friends who themselves and their families has escaped from the horrors of Captive Europe, from such as Lithuania and Poland, and knew its evils first-hand. Communism proved horribly wrong in practice as well as theory. It presented itself always as the more moral option: it promised equality, but delivered poverty and slavery. The capitalism it criticized endlessly was said to be immoral, but was based on the mutually beneficial exchange, and delivered wealth and freedom. One imposed itself by force, while the other offered its benefits. I read the works which praised communism and found them full of lies, deception, and self-deception. One of the great scandals of the 20th Century is the deceptions and self-deception of intellectuals with respect to Communism and Socialism.\nI read The God That Failed, Robert Conquest, Witness, 1984, Animal Farm, Farewell to Catalonia, Solzhenitsyn, Sidney Hook, Hayek (The Road to Serfdom), Leo XIII, and more. Much later, I came to love Michael Novak, who also grew up in my same Western Pennsylvania, such as The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, and “Liberation Theology: But does it liberate?” I watched millions flee or try to flee Communism, and flee to the United States and England. Even Marx himself had fled Germany and found refuge in England, though he never showed gratitude. Voltaire had taught us, long before, that England exemplified freedom in the world. Throughout my early university years—1967-74--- I watched Marxists and their supporters with endless criticism of the US and the West, while they sycophantically praised the USSR, Mao and Red China, and such villains as Castro and “Che,” the latter still idolized and romanticized by youth and adults who wear his picture and thus honor his murders.\nThe Marxists, then as now, find causes of behavior not in individuals but in larger events and qualities, such as economic systems and class. They talked of people being “objectively” wrong, even when well=intentioned. Of course, they rejected free will (although they knew little of its history—ask your Marxist friends to recount and distinguish Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas, or the later Luther, and to explain each’s version of what causes men to do evil, even when they know it to be evil. Ask them about how people “blind themselves” and “harden their hearts.”).\nToday’s Intersectionalists [I prefer “Deer at the Crossroads”], and Post-truth advocates, likewise reject ideas of individual responsibility (except when it comes to Police, Republicans, and CEOs, whom they blame and want to imprison), seeking “the root causes” of poverty, and to change the “system,” rather than individual behavior. To them, as to the Marxists, individual behavior is epiphenomenal, merely a symptom of the “system,” which must first be changed if change is to occur. They claim there is no objective truth (although this would seem, if true, to apply to them as well…yet they are full of such contradictions).\nI remember, from childhood, the motto of the McKeesport Police Department: Before you seek to change the world, first change yourself. Good behavior starts with humility and acceptance of responsibility for one’s own actions.\nToday’s ideas of institutional or implicit racism are unscientific nonsense, but flow directly from the unscientific nonsense of Marxism and its assumptions. Polygraphs (lie detector machines) do not test for truth, but rather for physical phenomena, which are interpreted by the Polygrapher to indicate truthfulness or not. The machine does not and cannot measure whether the person is lying, but only measure physical conditions (See National Academy of Sciences report debunking polygraphs). In much of science, there are attempts to measure what cannot be measured by finding surrogates. In implicit racism theory, Greenwalt and Banaji developed in the 1990s the IAT Test (IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST), which purports to measure racism, sexism, or the like. What it actually measures, however, is the quickness or slowness of response to certain pictures. This was developed in their book BLINDSPOT (The hidden biases of good people). On line, one can take IAT tests, which have become a multi-million dollar industry, just like other unscientific tests (such as Meyers Briggs and its cousins. Read the legal fine print and disclaimers at the Myers Briggs website).\nDon’t forget Lincoln: “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time,…”\nThe IAT tests do not and cannot measure what they purport to measure. Even if they measure correctly that a person had racist thoughts or feelings, that still would not show that the person was racist. We are not responsible for our thoughts or feelings or dreams, but rather for what we do with them. A person can be “born” homosexual, but choose to be celibate. We may be born with predispositions to alcohol, but choose not to drink, and thus avoid “occasions of sin.” We are dealt our cards, on where we are born, but we play our own cards. Poverty does not cause crime: most poor people are not criminals. We are not condemned to smoke, because our parents smoked, or to be violent if those who raised us were violent. We can choose to have, as wrote Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a BAD CHILDHOOD, [but a ] GOOD LIFE.\nThere is often one correct admission even from the implicit (and institutional) racism advocates: it has become increasingly harder to find explicit racism (that is, racism for which there is actual evidence), Implicit racism means racism for which there is no evidence (but we “know” it must be there. How clever they were to hide it so well). When actual racism is discovered, we have ample laws to deal with it. Those who “find” racism everywhere in reality are impelled by false dogma, and not by science or evidence.\nSuch imputations of racism arise from “disparate” results, such as when it is alleged that a group, such as blacks, is more affected, disproportionately to its presence in the population. Blacks commit proportionately more violent crimes, including murder, than whites. Blacks are proportionately more convicted and imprisoned than whites. Some insist that such findings must be the result of racism, “implicit” when it we cannot otherwise find proof. The evidence and studies actually show that, when the nature of the crime and criminal history of the offender are taken into account, racism disappears as an explanatory factor. Rabid students and professors assert that even to allege or discuss such “facts” as the excessive black crime rate is “racist.” They reject science and its methods as racist. In my recent attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, I heard professors and students, on the panels, in the audiences, and in the hallways, make such assertions of implicit racism, and applaud asserters, and jeer if any panelist or questioner suggested that actual evidence was required. They were an intellectual mob.\nWhen the Obama Administration and some Courts find “disparate” conditions, they infer racism, and (at least since the Griggs v Duke Power “disparate impact” 1971 case) shift the burden of proof to employers and others to prove that they are NOT racist. This is wrong and absurd, but infects today’s law. Then court findings and consent decrees are taken as “proof” that there is racism, even though it remains assumed and imputed, not proved.\nThe Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald wrote, in the Wall Street Journal (10-10-2017), “The False “Science” of Implicit Bias,” worth reading, which dissects this madness, although she does not there trace it to its roots in materialism, determinism, and Marxism/Communism. These have taken hold in the American Universities, which power and politics have replaced the honest search for truth.\nIf there is an “institutional” bias, it is in these places against the truth and common sense. Plaintiffs are deemed innocent, and Defendants presumed guilty. This is Red Queen country from Alice in Wonderland.",
    "This book was chosen for a book club discussion. The science was fascinating. The authors did a great job laying the foundation on how the human unconscious brain works. Great to be aware of biases or personal \"blind spots\" in order to lead the life you desire to lead in your conscious mind.",
    "Blind Spots is an interesting romp into the world of unconscious stereotyping, why we do it, and how we can either eradicate (or more likely) work around it. Banaji and Greenwald are two psychologists who have (I think, together) developed tests called Implicit Association Tests (IAT's). These tests cleverly find out whether we make unconscious associations between things (like white people and \"nice\" words, or men and \"leadership\" words). I'll leave it to you to read their explanation of how these tests work - and you can take a few of them in the book - but all of this helps us get at what unconscious biases we have. (This, in contrast to a lot of our talk about discrimination and bias, which focuses only on intentional bias. Here, we are talking about unconscious discrimination and bias.)\n\nAnd what have the authors found in the years of administering IATs and looking at similar literature by others who study unconscious bias? Well, first.... we all have 'em. And second.... we generally have ones we don't want to have, like how Americans and Europeans tend to associate white faces with positive things and black (or non-white) faces with negative things, or how we all (even the elderly) take a dimmer view of the elderly than the young. And the worst part? Most of us show these biases even though our conscious brains are appalled by such associations. (For two good books exploring how our unconscious shapes our thought more than we think, see  Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind  and  The Rational Animal: How Evolution Made Us Smarter Than We Think .)\n\nThe authors go into why we stereotype (we are pattern-seeking creatures), how stereotypes can lead us astray as well as hurt the sterotyped, evidence of how ingrained the tendency to see the world in \"us and them\" terms, and suggestions for how to work around these biases (because ridding ourselves of them may not be an option). The authors back their ideas up with moderately thorough reviews of existing data, which is good, considering that the nature of their argument means that we can't exactly argue back (\"But, I would never discriminate!\"). Their suggestions range from figuring out creative ways to avoid being in the position to discriminate (the symphony who found a way to do \"blind\" auditions for instrumentalists), to the importance of exposing yourself to those who confound stereotypes (reviewing stories of black heroes can mitigate black = negative associations).\n\nI take off one star only for occasional faulty reasoning by the authors. One such example occurred in their discussion of the general public's equation of pit bulls with violence (which statistically does not quite bear out). Their suggestion was that if the statistics don't bear out, the only reason we might treat the next pit bull we see as likely dangerous is sheer dumb fear. Not so! It may be that we have less to lose in treating the next pit bull we see as violent when it is not than we have to lose in not doing so if it is. Not that it is a big deal, but occasional sloppiness in reasoning does persist throughout the book. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants interesting (albeit painful) highlighting of our unconscious tendency toward irrational bias. Even if we just learn about our own blind spots, we might have a tendency to be on the look out for them and maybe improve our decision making. Worth a read!",
    "I love this book! I had to buy it for one of my classes and I ended up loving it! It is so fascinating to learn about the hidden biases in your own mind. Would definitely recommend!",
    "I first heard about the Implicit Association Test (IAT) from Malcolm Gladwell. In one of his works (I can’t recall which one), Gladwell discusses on bias and how ingrained they can be in our minds. He even took the IAT and it showed that he held a negative bias towards African Americans. As the son of a Jamaican woman, Gladwell was stunned by these results. Apparently, though you may see yourself as an independent entity, you are very much a product of the system you grew up in.\n\nIf this is all you know about the IAT, I think you are set. If you want to know more, Blindspot can enlighten you. The IAT was developed authors Banaji and Greenwald.\n\nEveryone has a bias. It is impossible as a human to function without bias. Humans are social creatures. This book dives deep into this idea.\n\nThough interesting, this book was not my favorite. I felt like Gladwell did a better job communicating the power of the IAT and its effects.\n\nIf you want to learn more specifically about the IAT, this is the book for you. I think the IAT is interesting, it is descriptive but not prescriptive. I think the IAT can show us a flaw in society, but not in individual biases.",
    "If you're folloiwng this work then you will know most of what is here, but the framework that is around it and additional references are excellent and informative.",
    "Read this to see how we may be biased without knowing it.",
    "A good book, very worth the read. It does take for granted that you are on board with their methodology - they explain their process well but I would have liked to see it tackle some criticism more head on. Regardless, some very interesting points about how to identify bias.",
    "I liked the book, thought provoking enough and highlights that we all carry bias in every single action we take. Have used some of it n my work practices.",
    "Will make you take a good look at yourself. Very insightful."

    "This book provides a lucid, updated account about what is involved in successfully introducing and getting mainstream acceptance of disruptive innovations in high tech related businesses that can also be applied more broadly as well (e.g. in other industries, non-profits).\n\nI first became aware of Moore’s book “Living on the Fault Line” (see my review of this and “Escape Velocity”) when at CSC Consulting where I also started to hear about his concepts such as the “Technology Adoption Life Cycle.” Given increased recent interest in such topics, it was heartening to discover that Moore had issued a new edition of his initial book which drew me to examine this version. and the book for the first time.\n\nThe book consists of two parts. Part I is about “Discovering the Chasm” the need to gain support for a disruptive innovation vs. just expecting The Field of Dreams (if you build it they will come) can be realized. Part II is about Crossing the Chasm using an analogy to the WWII D-Day invasion where the group has to: target the point of attack, assemble the invasion force, define the battle, and launch the invasion. A conclusion discusses the financial, organizational and R&D aspects of approaching and leaving the chasm behind. He treats how different stakeholders are involved and mobilized (see my review of  Stakeholder Theory: The State of the Art ). Helpful appendices summarize the high-tech market development model (which is business to business and the subject of Moore’s second book “Inside the Tornado”) and a four gears model for engaging consumers in adopting digital innovations (business to consumer).\n\nAt the time of this writing, I was doing some work with a non-profit organization advocating treatment and research advances related to mental health issues. I was struck by the notion that Moore’s model could apply in such non-profit sector situations as well (see my review of Daniel Siegel’s  Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation  based on recent neuroscience). It also appeared to me that these ideas could relate to career entrepreneurship (see my review of the book “Value Proposition Design” by A. Osterwalder et al and another of their books, “Business Model You”).\n\nBecause of my background and interests at the time, my favorite parts had to do with the parts on basic definitions of the technology adoption life cycle and marketing elements such as the diagrams showing “the simplified whole product model” (page 137) and “the competitive positioning compass” (page 167, 189). I was impressed that the revised edition had pertinent references to then current developments such as the evolution of SaaS (Software as a Service) with groups such as when the founders of PeopleSoft overtaken by SAP and Oracle initiated Work Day and contributed to the rise of Cloud Computing. Other cases sited that were particularly relevant to me included the one on Documentum (use in Pharma Regulatory & Safety matters), early targeting of the Mac computer at Corporate Advertising/Art Departments and the graphic appeal of these machines. Moore’s proposed definition of chasm crossing transition roles such as target market segment manager and whole product manager as well as the compensation/reward considerations between them and pioneering salespeople and technologists also stood out for me.\n\nSo, for an update on chasm crossing for disruptive innovations (and its broader application), take a look at Moore’s most recent edition of his excellent first book.",
    "The point of greatest peril in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the transition from an \"early market\" dominated by a few visionary customers to a \"mainstream market\" dominated by a large block of customers who are predominantly pragmatists in orientation, according to Geoffrey Moore in the third edition of this book. The gap between early and mainstream markets is what the author refers to as the \"chasm\", and many entrepreneurial businesses have fallen into it.\n\nThe chasm arises because innovators and early adopters of a new high-tech market have a fundamentally different outlook from that held by mainstream customers. Innovators are the first to try a new technology. They are the enthusiasts who don't care about manuals or user-friendliness or even practical benefits; all they care about is trying out something interesting and different. Visionary early adopters start to care about a new product when they can see that it enables a strategic leap forward, and they tend to be willing to pay for the strategic advantages which they hope the product will bring to them.\n\nMainstream purchasers, on the other hand, want to see that the product is working well and providing productivity improvements for other people like themselves, before they are willing to buy. The problem is that only other mainstream purchasers are \"people like themselves\", as references from visionary early adopters tend to be suspect. Thus a product which does well with innovators and early adopters can fall into the chasm because no mainstream purchasers are willing to be the first \"people like themselves\" to take it on.\n\nThe book, which goes on to describe the steps which need to be taken to cross the chasm, has become a classic since the first edition was published in 1991, but the content has been rewritten in the latest edition to bring it right up to date. The real question is whether, in the current environment of disruptive technologies, the principles outlined in the book continue to apply. Downes and Nunes in their book  Big Bang Disruption: Strategy in the Age of Devastating Innovation  present a very different picture of how innovations start, shoot to prominence, and die out in a very short space of time.\n\nIt seems to me that perhaps there is some similarity between the \"singularity\" early stage of the Big Bang model and the early adopter stage of Moore's model. Many products never make it out of the singularity. Further, perhaps there is no longer a single model that applies to all technology innovations. Undoubtedly there are many products which do follow Moore's model and have to come up with a strategy for crossing the chasm, but perhaps there are other products to which the model does not apply.\n\nIn any event, this is a very useful book for any entrepreneur or marketer in a field of technology.",
    "The book is a dense read, but a critical one. A lot of companies go over the cliff instead of crossing the chasm because they fail to mainstream their products. This challenge is addressed here with a targeted market approach that the author compares to D-Day. The book gets tactical - and sometimes difficult to read - but will give you a blueprint for action as you develop your products and markets.",
    "Good book that explains the product innovation cycle in a clear (albeit simplified) framework. It has a rightful place in the business innovation literature as a \"must read\". Only caveat of course is that it could lull the reader into thinking that this process is easy to manage as this analysis benefits hindsight bias (like almost all business books). One may find that the chasm crossing approach is quite chaotic and difficult to foresee by the entrepreneur as the industry structure is usually still rapidly evolving in the early years.",
    "I work in an industry forum which aims to accelerate adoption of small cell technologies, and this book has really helped explain the two opposing mindsets on the early adopters and the mainstream, and hence why the chasm exists. Reading this has really helped me realize that going mainstream really does require a different approach and message.",
    "Not actually containing anything innovative for people who already work in this area, is does a good job of pulling together a vision of marketing and development strategy for clueless upper management, who won't read this, just give it to their staff. (which is exactly what the book says don't do).",
    "I love marketing books and this one starts well but I found it laboured its point somewhat. Worth a read, especially for people designing new products but not very engaging.",
    "Excellent classic management book - still highly relevant to all start-up businesses."

    "One of the most valuable things I found is the way the book was executed. Is easy,intuitive,and clear in every aspect. The best thing is that you never feel you are learning in a traditional way. amazing!",
    "How good is this book? Well not only should you read this book, but everyone at your company should read this book as well. It is a game changer.\n\nValue Proposition Design is a sequel to the authors' previous book, Business Model Generation.\n\nIf you're not familiar with their previous book, its worth a read, but I'll be honest... Not everyone at your company needs to read their first book. I'm a firm believer in their book, at this point I would rather see a Business Model than a Business plan. So I want the business and technical leadership to read Business Model Generation. But Value Proposition Design is the book I want everyone to read.\n\nThe new book focuses on the most important part of any product, crafting the value proposition; in other words, why a customer should use your product or service. And it does a fantastic job.\n\nIt can be very difficult to get people to start thinking about their product from the customers point of view. But just the templates the authors posted to their website changed how I promoted my ideas. Their book is just incredible. Its a guided tour in how to make great products. It starts with a guide to how to think about your product from the customers point of view and communicate that around your company.\n\nIn fact, you can get that guide for free from their website. It's the first 100 pages of the book.\n\nIf the book just did that it would be worth the cost and time. But their book goes beyond that to discuss how you can actually make that product happen as you test your product with customers, adjust to the slings and arrows of the market.\n\nIn other words, its not just how to think from the customers point of view to create great products, but its how to bring those products through the development pipeline. It's filled with tips and tricks that people have used; expect to keep the book on your desk going forward as you bring your products to market. It's basically a cookbook for making great products.\n\nI can't recommend this book highly enough. Try the first half free from www.strategyzer.com . Then buy it. Your company will be glad you did.",
    "Love this book!! Great information, and I love how the book is designed which is very engaging and I love just reading the book till the end!! It will always come handy the tools that is mentioned in this book!!",
    "The book is well written and the content is great. Whether you are new to the concept or a seasoned value proposition designer, the book provides a great foundation and ways to expand your own value proposition (personal or business). I did not give it a five star because there are some pages where I think a darker font would have been more appropriate for easy reading. Their books, Business Model and Value proposition complement each other and you will get more out of them when you read both books.",
    "Alex Osterwalder & team have created the definitive easy-to/must-uses guide on how to create a compelling value proposition. Yes, definitive. Any business is first and foremost about the customer, even though it seems so many have forgotten that. If you don’t have a compelling value proposition, you don’t need a business model because you won’t have a business.\n\nValue Proposition Design (#VPDesign) clearly teaches how to discover customers’ real needs – the needs they have for and by themselves, not the needs we want them to have or the needs we want to solve…even if they aren’t really the customers’. The VPDesign toolkit – which is easy to follow, use and adopt – makes it difficult to retain your own biases and see reality.\n\nIt’s not just the words. The fabulous visual and symbolic style of the book makes it easy to follow, to use as a handbook and daily tool for prototyping, testing, iterating and creating meaningful and valuable solutions for customers. The icons are memorable and can become part of your team’s lexicon for thinking about customers. Just as in Business Model Generation, this book is a tool to use daily to think about your business – internally and externally. I’ve used the VPDesign extensively with entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and for customers outside the organization and inside the organization.\n\nSo, you MUST get this book (and Business Model Generation) and start using it. It will change how you view your business, your customers – for the better, in ways you can’t even begin to imagine.\n\nIn full disclosure, I helped co-create Alex & Yves’ first book, Business Model Generation and was a pre-reader for Value Proposition Design.",
    "This book is full of meaningless jargon with the overall strategy of getting you to log into their website and sell you their courses. Yes, the graphics are colorful and inviting, but the content is subpar. What a disappointment.",
    "There's no shortage of information on value proposition, typically full of jargon, and inaccessible for many who are not in the business. Strategyzer's book clearly explains how to get to the heart of what matters, so that business owners can put relatable strategies into place. I look forward to recommending this book to clients to assist our work together. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",
    "I had qualms about this book, but I was having some troubles writing my value proposition. A successful, older colleague of mine said he liked this book. I ordered it, read a bit, and I was able to come upon with my value prop. One I am very happy with too.\n\nIt’s a short and succinct one that also appeals to what my buyers want. All in all, I liked this book, found it useful, and I would recommend it.",
    "A really good book, nothing inspirational or new in terms of the fundamentals and underlying approach of the piece however, what is new is the methodology of idea production, tracking and development.\n\nThe online toolkit (which you get a lite version of free after purchasing the book) has some really useful stuff in it and I would encourage any purchaser to use this as well in conjunction with the book as it really enhances your learning trajectory.\n\nThe book itself is short on words and big on ideas. As they say - a picture is worth 1000 words and a lot of the time you're reading something, with the visuals and the guides online new ideas pop into your head as you're reading. I'd encourage all purchasers to sit there with a big pad whilst reading as you're likely to get at least 40 new ideas for your company whilst going through it.\n\nI wouldn't advocate a complete adoption of all the suggestions in the book, some of them are very American and wouldn't go down with a British audience or workforce, but there is a tonne of good stuff there. The Stanford 2016 reading list highlights yet another blinder!\n\n4/5 - brilliant book, well worth a read.",
    "A lot of this is just freely available on the web somewhere or via Twitter, unfortunately. The graphics are probably more appealing than the content, it's cleverly pieced together and everything but fairly straight forward, vague, generic thinking to be honest. Certainly nowhere near as precise as some of the blogs you'll find out there via seasoned startup CEO's and heads of departments that are sharing strong acumen in specific fields. A useful resource you can use across varying departments, include in internal training/appraisal or have graduates/interns read when joining a company.",
    "I brought the original book called \"business model canvas\" and i have used the book in my own business and for client businesses.\n\nThis book in particular narrow down on the value proposition and how to test the products / service against client needs. I did a brief workshop to test out the client pains against the value proposition and the results were very interesting. It gives you food for thought and also gives you scope to test, review, pivot, improve and grow your proposition.\n\nA CD is also available to help guide you thought all the steps.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in improving, testing their product and service lines. Even more valuable if you are starting up from scratch!",
    "This book is overrated. The \"Business Model Generation\" is good and useful, though too expensive for the real content which is the schematic itself.\nThis Value Proposition Design is a good example of how to sell more to the same customer.\n\nValue Proposition Design gets only 3 stars because :\n* For experienced people it is a good recap and a nice refresher. But it is too expensive and has too many useless drawings. The format is not handy at all.\n* For people with no experience it does not explain enough.\n\nHence my 3 stars: ok, but overrated",
    "This book is almost unreadable! It's full of nonsensical jargon and waffle.\nIt's not worthy of a space on my bookshelf and I'd feel guilty if I sold it so, it's on it's way into the bin. Maybe the recycling centre can turn it into something useful."

    "The book is a great blueprint on how to get things done. Unfortunately NYC's infrastructure has declined over the past 50 years and it's doubtful anyone in power has learned from Moses or has his spatial skills. Since the Moses days the government replaced many of the builders, engineers, and transportation professionals with lawyers and public administrators. This disrespect of infrastructure spread elsewhere and may partially explain why our national infrastructure spending has plummeted 60% since the Eisenhower years and 30% over the past several years. As for the author it appears he was initially on a mission to be negative of Moses, but it appears Moses grew on him somewhat. Five stars.\n\nOne star for the chapter titled \"One Mile\" - the stretch of the Cross Bronx traversing East Tremont. The book paints a neighborhood of victims, but makes many mistakes and exclusions of the history and design of this stretch of highway:\n1. The chapter painted a picture of everyone was blindsided in the 1950's when the XBronx was built- this isn't true. There is no mention that the plan for the highway predated Moses- it was by the Regional Plan Association, back in the 1920's and formalized in the 1930's. Most of the building stock in East Tremont is of masonry steel buildings and built around this time. The developers knew the score. They knew a highway would eventually come and they decided to build anyways- it was a business decision. They were reimbursed when their buildings were condemned. The tenants were the ones who were angry when displaced, though many of them may have known that it was going to eventually happen, yet decided to move in anyways.\n2. The author tried to paint East Tremont as a neighborhood that goes back many, many generations. There are some buildings with stone foundations, but once again it appears the bulk of the building stock was built around the time the RPA first came up with the idea for the highway. Pictures of Yankee Stadium (to the south, closer to Manhattan) show the stadium was surrounded by open fields in 1923 and the Grand Concourse in the background of these photos was a building-less road. Most of the Bronx had just converted over from farms and rural lands at the time the RPA initially planned for the Cross Bronx.\n3. The book doesn't mention the highway crosses over a ridge in this area. East Tremont (to the north) and Crotona Park (to the south) sit on the ridge that runs north-south. The tenants led the fight to have the highway rerouted south to the northern edge of Crotona Park. The ridge is higher and wider in Crotona Park and the Bronx River to the east is a 6 to 8% descent from the park. Moses' intent was to minimize the highway descent from the ridge to the river crossing to 3%. The descent from East Tremont to the river is about 4%, which allowed Moses to achieve the 3% with help of cuts and some elevated roadway. The book doesn't mention anything of the terrain nor the reason for choosing the less steep East Tremont path but reports by Columbia and MIT do.\n4. The chapter provides a map of the route Moses built and a proposed route designed by a hired gun engineer the East Tremont tenants hired. The engineer's background was work on FDR's Westchester parkway system which is known for being dangerous. It's loaded up with dangerous \"S\" curves. His proposed plan, to reroute the highway to the northern edge of Crotona Park, also had a dangerous \"S\" curve (reverse curve). \"S\" curves are no longer allowed for interstate design and are outlawed in many municipalities' land use laws. None of the Moses critics nor the author picked up on this major flaw, but the Columbia report did.\n5. The map also shows the proposed route by the hired gun was to travel right through an existing transit station. The transit station would had to be rebuilt. Once again the critics and the author didn't pick up on this major flaw, although it was the author who provided the map.\n6. The MIT and/or Columbia report mentioned there was a study that analyzed the East Tremont Association's hired gun's plan. The study concluded his plan would require as many displaced people as what was eventually built. The book doesn't mention anything about this study.\n7. The takeaway from this chapter is that the highway divides East Tremont. It does not. The map provided by the author appears to show only one cross street (Southern Boulevard) was to remain. In reality all of the cross streets remain. And none of them were elevated. Most of this stretch of highway is in a 30 foot deep cut. You don't see much of East Tremont from the highway and very little of East Tremont sees the highway. The cut is only about 90 to 100 feet across, thus you always see pedestrians walking along the cross streets 30 feet above.\n8. The author failed to mentioned many of the buildings removed for construction were eventually replaced. The highway has many buildings lining it that were built after the completion of the highway.\n9. In 1976 President Jimmy Carter (prior to his presidency) visited Charlotte Street, a few blocks south of East Tremont, and described it as the \"worst\" neighborhood in America. The neighborhood went downhill quickly from blight that crept up from the South Bronx. It is doubtful the people of East Tremont would have stayed put. The author painted a different picture.\n10. The Columbia study mentioned the Cross Bronx has extremely high truck traffic (25% of the traffic). The trucks provide goods to Long Island, Queens, and Brooklyn, but the book doesn't mention this and doesn't mention what the alternative would be to transport goods.\n\nAlso one star for not giving the history of the West Side prior to the West Side Highway. When Moses finished the highway (he didn't the start the highway), it replaced many commercial rail lines and warehouses that blocked Manhattan from the river. The rail lines ran the full length of the west side of Manhattan and the rails brought goods into the city. Even overseas goods came in by these West Side rails. The city implemented heavy levies on goods coming in by ship, thus businessmen had goods unloaded on the NJ side of the Hudson, the goods were transported up the Hudson to Albany by rail where they crossed the Hudson and then they came down the east side of the Hudson to the West side of Manhattan. The RPA plan (once again predated Moses) was to replace the rails with a highway. Thus the RPA planned to replace the trains with trucks (via the Lincoln Tunnel). The author didn't explain any of this and didn't explain how goods would be brought into the city otherwise.\n\nThree stars for blaming Moses for today's city's congestion.The city was already clogged with vehicles by the time Moses arrived, which the author did explained. But the book blames the continuing congestion on Moses, for not designing his expressways to allow for mass transit. The author was inconsistent in that he cherry picked the RPA's role. He didn't explained that Moses' expressways were actually the RPA's plan but then the author cited the RPA's much later recommendation for expressway and bridge design to allow for mass transit. RPA's recommendation came after Moses broke ground. Moses' later expressways, out on Staten Island, appear to be adequate to allow for mass transit construction- the author didn't reveal this. Allowing for above ground mass transit requires more land to condemn thus more money and it would have reduced the number of highways that he could have built, but once again it appears Moses did make the effort out on Staten Island. The author also never explained that the existing mass transit was built (about 115 years ago) in very developed, congested areas without the benefit of prior planning allowing for mass transit. Most of these lines in Manhattan and Brooklyn were built in congestion as heavy as today's if not more so.\n\nThe author made a big error and a big omission regarding the reason Moses developed parkways solely for cars. Many reviewers believed the author painted Moses as a racist for the reason. But Moses had limited funds and he did the most with these funds. Designing the parkways for cars saved him a lot of money and allowed him to have money to spend on other projects. Roadways for heavy buses cost much more- the pavements have to be much thicker and the roadbeds have to be much deeper, plus the maintenance is much, much higher. Per a government study, a single truck or single bus with typical 18,000 lbs. axle loads causes as much damage to the roads and bridges as 9,600 cars. The author failed to explain the enormous costs for roads and bridges designed for buses and trucks.\n\nThe book omitted the RPA's role in the misguided Lower Manhattan and Mid-town Manhattan Expressways plans. The author explained how the idea for the expressways was misguided, which he is completely correct, but he failed to explain it was not Moses' idea, but the RPA's. The RPA prepared a map/plan in 1929 that clearly depicts 4 expressways crossing the width of Manhattan: the Lower Manhattan and Mid-town Expressways, one around 125th Street and the current Trans-Manhattan Expressway. How is it so many Moses' critics can not read a map or plan? Btw, it was lame of the RPA to let Moses take the full blame for their misguided idea.\n\nAnd lastly he painted a picture of Moses being the reason why mass transit declined. The problem with this theory is that Moses has been out of power for 50 years. The theory doesn't explain why nothing has been done with mass transit since. The city has done virtually nothing to connect the outer boroughs with each other. Most of the subways in the outer boroughs are nothing but spokes that lead into Manhattan. Back in the era of private transit companies, the main demand was for transport into Manhattan, yet transit companies still connected the spokes with a cobweb of trolley lines. For various reasons the trolley lines and many of the elevated train lines connecting the spokes were removed. The lethargic government hasn't made any real effort to reconnect these spokes, even though the demand for travel between the outer boroughs has increased. Thus the highways Moses built are clogged all week and weekend long with local traffic. These boroughs need both expanded highways and subways connecting each other, but the city does nothing and the elitist Moses' critics living in Manhattan couldn't care less.\n\nNYC had the best mass transit system in the world 70 to 110 years ago when it was developed and operated by private industry- the author didn't explain this. The Moses' critic types of the day wanted city control of these subways which they got around 1940. Since then the subways have fallen into mediocrity. The suburban rail lines have a similar history- once again nothing has been done in decades to the system since the government takeover of around 1970. Now that Moses is gone our roadways, bridges, and tunnels have also fallen to 50 years of government neglect. Our tunnels and bridges are routinely backed up for 30 minutes during rush hour, the airports are rated as the worst in the nation, the city highway system is consistently clogged, it is vastly undersized, Penn Station and the bus terminals are dumps, and the subway system is poorly maintained, dirty, noisy, poorly lit, and convoluted. The subway system is extremely confusing for out-of-towners. Private industry and Moses had real transportation professionals running everything. Now we have lawyers and public administrators. Very little ever gets done. Things that do get done cost far more and take far longer to complete than they should. And many mistakes are made with planning and design. As a group they have horrible spatial skills and construction knowledge. They have deflected the blame for today's decrepit transportation system to Moses and they have insulated themselves by brainwashing us that it's Moses' fault.",
    "Don't let the 1,000+ pages of Robert Caro's biography of Robert Moses intimidate you. It is immensely entertaining and readable biography, bringing you face to face with one of the most important and least heard of Americans of the 20th Century. Robert Moses' brilliance, arrogance, vision and utter ruthlessness built so much of modern NYC's landscape, that there is perhaps not a single piece of significant modern infrastucture he didn't have a hand in building. As \"Parks Commissioner,\" a position he in essence created via legislation to give him nearly untouchable power which outlasted governors and mayors, he not only built countless parks and returned Central Park to its orginal glory, but created nearly every public beach and park on Long Island and the roadways needed to get New Yorkers to them; most highways, bridges and thoroughfares throughout the city; the UN building, Lincoln Center, Triborough Bridge, Jones Beach, countless public housing projects - the list goes on. You name it, if it was built in NYC in the middle of the 20th Century, Robert Moses was behind it.\n\nCaro's incredibly entertaining biography is more than just the profile of the man, but the era and politics he came up in, the changing of the old Tammany guard, and how modern New York was created. You get intimate portrait of a man obsessed with his own power, and brilliant vignettes of how he charmed, bullied, slandered, intimidated, enriched, blackmailed and conned his contemporaries in ways that would make a Mafia don blanche. While borough presidents, ward heelers, mayors and US presidents came and went, Moses remained the consistent face of all that was good about public service in New York, having provided public much of the infrastructure they believed they needed. It was only very late in his long career that New Yorkers started second guessing this icon's decisions, and realized that his obsession with building highways and bridges instead of public transportation, and his indifference if not hostility to working class neighborhoods, created as many problems as his solutions fixed.\n\nA fascinating and highly entertaining biography which richly deserved its Pulitzer Prize. This is historical biography at its best.",
    "This is a brilliant elucidation and proof of Acton's famous aphorism that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is more perfect in this respect than his monumental and equally fine tomes on Lyndon Johnson who at least had principles and who having got to the top he intended to put into practice before being derailed by Vietnam. He was a truly tragic figure for which admiration and disgust vie in the mind of the reader\n\nThere is no redeeming feature in Caro's depiction of Moses who was a truly vile man through and through and who desired power solely for power's sake. His character for all his ability is comprehensively demolished by this great work. Unfortunately the infrastructure he built and which destroyed so much of value in New York even if it could be demolished would not restore what has been lost.\n\nPerhaps most culpable in this tale is not the way that mayors caved into this demonic ego but the way the vaunted press lapped up everything Moses said and almost never challenged it. Where are America's investigative journalists? Largely comatose. But here I have my one quibble. There is no mention at all of the journalist Jane Jacobs, nor of her influential book,The Death and Life of American Cities, and nor of her considerable role in toppling Moses from his pedestal. This is an odd omission, and we know that she read Caro's hatchet job with relish, commenting that even though she knew Moses was an awful man this book was a shocking revelation. She had opposed his policies but not exposed his vile personality in all its vividness. It took Caro - one man delving deep into documents and sources, -to pull all the threads together to weave a shroud for a vampire. Moses was a monster, a racist, a bully a self-centred egotist, only interested in himself, indifferent to those he demeaned or whose lives he destroyed. It reminds me at least of another who has recently attained great power. Men such as Moses are the American nightmare.",
    "This is the Citizen Kane of biographies. Mr Caro's book has been highly praised, and deservedly so, and regularly included in the \"best of\" books, namely in the worthy 100 best non-fiction books of the XXth Century, made by Time.com. At over 1000 pages is a mamoth of a book, oceanic in every sense. At the same time it is very keen on details, letting us know, for instance, some of the brands the Moses family used in home appliances a the change of the century. It is a crash course also on American politics. And overall it is delivered with a very good prose, sober yet bright, faultless and elegant.\nAnd then, why not five stars?\nI do believe the matter of the book (Robert Moses himself) let down the writer from half of the book onwards. The ascent to glory is superbly told and rivals any novel of business sucess or any movie on the matter. Yet the second half, the way down of Mr Moses, is so petty that the reader feels that the subject of the book is becoming thinner and thinner by the page. And in the end, in the last years of Mr Moses nothing happens - literally.\nAlso, half way through the book, a reader cannot help but noticing what a poor man Robert Moses was - after the brilliant years at University and the ascent to glory and power in New York City, Mr Moses is revealed in his maturity as a undercover racist, misogynist and adulterer man. And also someone with deep troubles to relate with other people - his running for public posts are shameful and, ultimately, how he treated his own brother is simple nasty.\nFurthermore, the man who handled budgets of billion of dollars ended up begging for a menial job and almost living of charity.\nThe after taste is sad and hollow, and after roughly 700 pages the reader is expecting a conclusion at par with the first half. But we're left only thus: expecting. And the feeling is: is that all?",
    "This is a biography of a civil servant in New York from the 1920s onwards, involving people you have mainly never heard of in disputes that are long forgotten. Hardly the ingredients for a palm-moistening page turner you might imagine (especially one of over 1,000 pages). But the reason this massive tome is beloved by politicos is that it is to the activity of politics what \"Liar's Poker\" was to aspirant 1980s investment bankers - the ultimate guide book (although less fun, obviously). Compelling guide to manoeuvring and how to get and apply leverage in the political and bureaucratic worlds.",
    "I came to this after reading Rober Caro's Working and prior to that the 4 volumes to date of his biography of Lyndon B Johnson. I'm not sorry I read it - but it IS very long and it is about someone who was evidently quite remarkable but who is mostly memorable for having built much of the infrastructure of New York. I found the details of some of Moses' manoeuvres were a bit more than I personally found it rewarding to read.\n\nThe story of Moses' fall from power is of great interest; and of press coverage of Moses; and of Moses' character - though I'm not sure I buy into the thesis that power corrupted Moses - the book after all starts with some pretty dodgy doings around the support of swimming and minor athletics at Yale. Moses' character was probably flawed from the off - though this may have become more and more clear with the passage of time and the accumulation of evidence.\n\nSo: I would recommend this work to others, but with just a note of caution.",
    "Long an admirer of Robert A Caro’s biographies of LBJ, I confess I had ignored The Power Broker because at first glance a book about a man who built bridges, roads, parks and civic buildings sounded bland compared to the complex personality of Lyndon Johnson. I was wrong and this book fully deserves its reputation as one of the best biographies ever written. Robert Moses was a peculiar man, initially fascinated by, of all things, the British Civil Service and how it remained incorruptible. He doesn’t appear to have been formally trained in anything but he quickly mastered the tedious aspects of statutes and how they are drafted, power structures and where true control and authority lie. He learned a great deal from Gov Al Smith, to whom he was devoted, but unlike Smith, Moses was not a benign man. Throughout his career his personal power was protected by foresight, and the killer clause. He was never elected to anything (and his one attempt to run for office almost destroyed him by exposing his raw and ruthless personality). He was Park Commissioner because that role gave him the kind of inviolate authority that politicians could only envy. It also meant that the public thought he fought on the side of the angels because everyone likes parks. In his early days he was an idealist, and armed with a letter of passage by the Governor, he tirelessly explored the virgin hinterland of New York, jealously guarded by the Robber Baron families who wanted to exclude the riff-raff from the wilderness and the seaside. He planned Parkways that would enable middle-class Americans to drive to the countryside previously barred to them by the privileged. He built vast and luxurious venues where previously there had been just sand, with building materials and leisure facilities second to none. He understood structural engineering and drove his loyal (and often terrified) staff to produce blueprints and plans and costings in record time. And although he was most active during the Depression years, money never seemed to be a problem. The myriad financial deals and bond issues can become dense at times but they were directly related to the freedom given him by the structure of an ‘Authority’, compared to a municipality, city or state administration. He had no personal interest in money, and coming from a wealthy family had refused a salary. He was ‘money honest’ but as his taste for power grew he became corruptible, fascinated by power for its own sake. The idealist of the early chapters soon turns into something of a monster with huge prejudices against lower class people, blacks and ethnics. When he built his Expressways and Parkways he deliberately made the bridges crossing them too low to permit buses because he just wasn’t interested in people who didn’t drive a car. Ironically, he never learned to drive a car himself and was chauffered everywhere in a luxurious limo that served as his mobile office. As his engineering megalomania grew he evicted thousands of tenants and bulldozed their houses and tenements to make way for another road. The cruelty with which this was done was later exposed and led to his downfall. He drove his engineers and structural crews very hard and the New York bridges he built are his monuments along with the UN Building and the Lincoln Centre. Only very late did it dawn on people that Moses’ roads didn’t reduce congestion at all; they did the opposite, feeding traffic into huge jams and making commuting a nightmare. Cars didn’t just fill roads, they needed to be parked in the City and at the airport. Moses despised trains and buses so mass transit was never part of his plans, as anyone lining up for a cab at JFK can testify. Yet this fascinating man continues to confound the reader. Physically driven, he worked long days then relaxed by diving into the sea and swimming for miles. The atmosphere in his offices was lively and chatty and invigorating and he instilled loyalty as well as affection (and terror). He always defended his subordinants fiercely and was contemptuous of complaints, petitions or legal challenges. He cultivated the press who loved him to the point of dereliction of duty as far as the common good was concerned. For a long time most of the press were in awe of him and he could do no wrong, and the little people he had pushed around had to wait a long time for justice. But he was a mean SOB too, unforgiving and vengeful. Chapter 26 is a fascinating description of his relationship with his older brother, who he destroyed, and his mother, and only a psychiatrist could unravel the darkness there. (Chapter 35 also gives fascinating insights into Moses). But Caro’s skill as a biographer makes us feel sorry for Moses when his downfall finally arrives, at the hands of some maverick reporters and Nelson Rockefeller. At the same time the realisation dawns that his life’s work as a builder of roads and bridges caused far more problems than it resolved, and ultimately his career was devalued. Power was so important to him that to be excluded from it was agony, and he became a ghost haunting a landscape he had built."

    "A shipwreck has tossed you into a turbulent sea. Hold this book close to your chest, it's your life raft. Call to your shipmates as they're struggling to stay afloat, point out the rafts like yours already within their reach.\n\nThe build of your raft gives you the sight-lines and the confidence to lead your friends to shore. There, your raft changes shape. Now it's a guide for joining together and constructing a more seaworthy vessel, one which can weather — better yet, dispel – the catastrophes of climate change.\n\nIn short, easy-to-understand essays — numbered articles illustrated with clever infographics, even cartoons — The Carbon Almanac lays out what’s causing climate change and why it matters. Then the book spells out how to move from information to collective action.\n\nFor example: The list on page 327, headlined “Things To Do Today,” details more than ten quick-start steps to take. The first is to visit a specific page on the book's companion website and discover a group that needs your help. Say you read the article titled “Race, Fairness, and Climate” and want more. A visit to that webpage leads you to the Climate Justice Alliance, with whom you can join forces.\n\nMore than a book and a website, The Carbon Almanac spins off into a kids' version, an educators' guide, a photo book, and several podcasts — including an episode titled “The Carbon Almanac Origin Story.” Then there's The Daily Difference, an email service organizing thousands of fellow subscribers to press for systemic corporate and government change.\n\nThe Carbon Almanac's origin story codes a process which points to a promising future. In all its formats, The Carbon Almanac is the brilliant generosity of volunteers. It demonstrates what people of good will can do when we’re invited to give our time and skill to a worthy effort, when we’re met with warm welcome and sincere appreciation. Having taken part in this project, I've seen how this kind of fellowship opens up our capacity to learn, to co-create, and to lead.\n\nAs comprehensive as the The Carbon Almanac is, you might find something — a perspective, a concern, a sensibility — missing. In that case, use the book as code for leading into that dimension yourself.\n\nHold this book close to your chest — you may hear the earth's heartbeat resonant in your own. You may feel the impulse to safeguard who and what you love within the turbulence of our changing climate.",
    "This book is for you whether you’re passionate about climate change, “Eco-curious” and ready to do more, wondering if climate change is really real or simply, in need of a great gift for someone.\n\nWhen I first heard the title “The Carbon Almanac”, I was skeptical, to be honest, the title threw me off. I was not a “climate change person” and the main reason I looked it up was because a really good friend recommended it.\n\nAs a mom of two young children, life is hectic, and I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading, I was hooked. The book is fascinating and eye opening. After reading, I bought one for my neighbor, my best friend, every member of my family and a coworker.\n\nThis book should be called Everything you need to know about climate change in a digestible, easy to understand format, that gives you hope without sugarcoating reality, shows you why it’s urgent that we take action, provides simple steps you can take to really make a difference, and has amazing free bonus resources online for parents and teachers on how to talk to children about climate change.\n\nThe biggest aha for me was learning that there are SYSTEMS at work that created climate change and that recycling doesn’t have quite the impact I thought it did. I got so into it I’m now a volunteer spreading the word about the most important thing I learned. Collective action–where it matters–is the only thing that can create the systemic change needed to restore the earth for our children and we must act now.",
    "The Carbon Almanac is a breakthrough, collaborative book that offers climate science facts without noise, confusion, or agendas – to help each of us become well-informed about climate change.\n\nI'm part of the group of hundreds of volunteers from 90 countries that have come together with ringleader Seth Godin to produce The Carbon Almanac.\n\nAs I was reading the hundreds of pages in The Carbon Almanac, I realized how powerful this book is as a tool to help us understand truth and create change.\n\nFor example, I was fascinated to learn that the term “carbon footprint” was invented by advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather for British Petroleum. The goal is to shift the spotlight from energy companies to consumers making us feel like hypocrites and not take coordinated action.\n\nCarbon’s influence on our climate is an essential issue of our time. For so many people the problem is utterly overwhelming, and we don’t know where we can help other than to do the things we know are right, like recycle and switch to LED lightbulbs.\n\nBut there is so much more we can do.\n\nAs I dug into the research, I came to realize that the way we can help is to learn as much as possible and to spread the word to people we know. That’s where The Carbon Almanac comes in. I personally purchased 100 copies to give to friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nIt’s not too late.",
    "While there are a lot of mixed messages about sustainability and climate change and companies launching deflection campaigns to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions, this book cuts through a lot of the confusion that has resulted.\n\nThe information within The Carbon Almanac makes things clear about where we have come from but also what our future could be like and how we can take action ourselves, to create systemic change and ensure a better future for our children and theirs.\n\nOur business One Devonshire Place became a friend of The Carbon Almanac because we were concerned about the huge use of plastics in our industry. We are making changes in the way that we work and this book is helping us to move in the right direction.\n\nDr Robert Slater",
    "I thought I knew quite a lot about the climate crisis. I’ve been concerned about the changing climate for more than a decade and I’ve consistently done what I can to reduce my family’s carbon footprint.\n\nAs books have come along about climate change and sustainable economics, I’ve read them to keep myself up to date with the latest thinking. Many however have been quite hard to digest as they’ve clearly been written for academic impact within the scientific / economic / governance community.\n\nThe Carbon Almanac is different. It’s a single source repository of climate facts and data, thoughtfully put together so that anyone can get up to speed, regardless of where they are in their carbon emission reduction journey.\n\nIt breaks down the science into easily digestible language and includes ample further reading and resources for when you want to find out more.\n\nEvery day there are deflection stories in the media, attempting to downplay the crisis and/or renewable energy alternatives. Having read this, I feel far more equipped to debate with the climate sceptics I come across in day-to-day life.\n\nOf all the books I’ve read on the topic to date, this is one of the, if not the, best. It’s helped me see how much more I can do to effect positive change.",
    "This is such a helpful resource that will make having essential conversations about the planet so much fun! It is a 'buy it for yourself and extra copies to give away' book. And the way it was produced - through the collaboration of hundreds of people worldwide - is pretty mind-blowing.\n\nIt has already fed and enlarged my curiosity. It gives me places to look for more information and so many threads to pull on. It will take a long time to exhaust its possibilities and will become very well-thumbed in the process I am sure.\n\nKeep talking. It is not too late.",
    "I've been reading about the climate and the challenges we are facing for years. And while I see that we need collective action, I've had difficulty explaining the concept to people in my life. It's overwhelming, or it can be, and I've had a hard time communicating how I see the world - and how we have the opportunity to come together and create change.\n\nSince I stumbled across this book, I finally feel empowered to have these conversations. It's digestible, and practical and the information is laid out clearly with the help of illustrations, photography and charts. It's a conversation starter - and presents the facts without difficult-to-understand terminology. I'll be purchasing a number of copies to share with my family members who I'd love to have this knowledge. And .. of course.. a couple of copies for leadership within our organization too! Because I know now, even more so, that this is a systems problem.\n\nCannot recommend this book enough. Get one, or get five and hand them out. Finally, we have the tool we need to get the word out, to those that we wish would understand.",
    "This book brings a positive mobilizing energy into the climate conversation.\n\n\"We choose to go the moon ... not because it is easy but because it is hard.\" With that announcement, President JFK launched a concerted effort across the globe. Humans did the difficult, creating new ideas, new technologies, new science so that we could make it happen. As a race, we achieved what we had thought impossible.\n\nThis book is an echo of that kind of global concerted effort. We are a community of humans, facing a common goal, and working together to create solutions. The book is written by a coalition of 300 authors, researchers, artists (many of them my friends) under the guidance of Seth Godin. It is filled with facts, figures and has talking points for everyone:\n- simple ideas for those explorers who are new to the climate discussion, looking for information on how this happened (Climate Change for Rookies)\n- strategies, checklists and tools for those anxious to start doing their part (Its Not Too Late; Things To Do Today)\n- the positive economics of climate related technologies - (E-bikes; Wind Energy; Electric Cars)\n- bigger, meatier (?) articles provide those who have been active in the climate conversation access to additional research, contacts and context so that they can make a bigger difference. (Scenarios; Whose Job Is It)\n\nPersonally, I seek to talk about climate through the lens of hope. I believe that the best idea will come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. To inspire young people that this is still a battle that can be won, we have to ensure we talk about it with optimism. And that will come through clearly in this book: Urgency, but instead of desperation, a chance for us all to collectively put our heads, minds and behaviours together and move towards a world worth leaving for our children and our children's children.\n\nAny respectful discussion on climate is a good discussion. When you get the book and love it, share it forward. Gift a copy to a group of friends. This book is too good to stay sitting on the shelf."

    "Really enjoyed this book. Loved the different perspectives discussed and guidelines for different roles. This is a must read for designers of all types and leaders who want to build a design-centric organization.",
    "There's definitely a lot of useful information here that I'll be sure to implement in future.\n\nIf you are new to the design industry especially, this is an indispensable read/listen. My main criticism is that, if you already have some experience, and you are generally good at your job, much of this stuff is already second-nature to you. There's also a lot of extra padding and waffle — for example, a section on how to get the best technical setup for a video call.\n\nAll that said, there's nothing wrong with brushing up on a few reminders, and there are certainly plenty of good hints and nuggets to be found, so I would still recommend it.",
    "Any design professional looking to make a career move , or move up in their existing company, needs to read this book.\n\nTom Greever has laid out a pathway for those having difficulties, or those making basic mistakes, communicating their design intent. This skill is what differentiates high performers in a company who get the raises and promotions from those struggling to progress in their field.\n\n5/5 stars!!\n6/5 if used as a passive aggressive gift.",
    "Articulating design decisions is so good that I'm upset I didn't read it earlier, Or before starting my career.\n\nThe book changes everything for me going forward. This book is INSANE, the best book for UX I have read. I'm already having results in my meetings and pitching design decisions to stakeholders.",
    "I've been building tech for 20 years and recently became a coach. I have clients at different stages of their careers; some are in UX, others are not.\n\nI'm observing that many of the bootcamps that ux newbies are taking aren't helping them to build this muscle of articulating their design rationale. This leaves them feeling unprepared for interviews or lacking confidence discussing proposals with Engineers and other stakeholders who may bring other ideas and opinions to the table.\n\nI'm using this book to help my clients learn how to communicate their designs but also remind me of all the tricks i've learned along the way and have forgotten about.",
    "This book has the right info I needed at this point in my career and details how I should be communicating with stakeholders, managers, and executives",
    "I can't recommend this book highly enough. I am an Industrial Designer / UX Designer and Professor of Design with over 25 years of experience, and this is the first book that explains how to effectively articulate what we do, why we do what we do, and the value of what we do to our counterparts in other disciplines. It is a valuable resource for entry-level designers, as well as seasoned designers like myself.",
    "I know I'll keep coming back to this book again and again as I move through my career. It's an incredibly relevant and practical resource full of useful examples and templates to help designers communicate better with stakeholders. The author clearly illustrates how 'great design' is only part of the process –– the other part is gaining the necessary support of stakeholders and bringing others on board. The book highlights critical steps designers should take as they navigate meetings (from casual to formal) related to their projects. When these steps are taken, it results in stronger working relationships and trust.",
    "As someone with over 15 years of experience in the design industry I expected this book to establish a vocabulary that can help designers, new and senior alike, articulate why they make decisions, and focus on outcomes so that they can be more intentional in their craft. Instead, I got a glorified self-help book on how to write emails and justify decisions by cowering down. This was completely misleading and quite frankly, a waste of time. No designer worth their salt will need this. I wish I could give negative stars.",
    "The book is very educational/well thought through. A colleague recommended it amd I’m glad she did. Suitable for all design disciplines and Marketing people as well"

    "Abby's book is incredibly well thought out and easy to read! Its full of useful and applicable leadership tips and inspired me to be a better and more unifying leader. 11/10 recommend this book for anybody!!",
    "Abby Wambach’s Wolfpack: how to come together, unleash our power, and change the game had me at, “It’s your time.” p. 7\n\nWhat I really like about this sweet simple concise read is mostly how impactful the guide posts are:\n\n1. Create your own path\n2. Be grateful for what you have ANd demand what you deserve.\n3. Lead now - from wherever you are.\n4. Failure means you're finally IN the game.\n5. Be FOR each other.\n6. Believe in yourself. Demand the ball.\n7. Lead with humanity. Cultivate Leaders.\n8. You're not alone. You've got your pack.\n\nThe final page before the above list leads me to consider although Abby lists what we can create, she leaves the reader with their responsibility for how with others possessing similar values.\n\nP. 92\n\nSo don't just asking yourself, “What do I want to do?” ask yourself: “Who do I want to be?”\n\nThe most important thing I’ve learned is that what you do will never define you for long. Who you are always will.\n\nWe are the Wolves.\nThere is magic inside us.\nThere is power among us.\nLet’s unleash and unite.\nLet’s storm the valleys together, and change the game forever.\n\nThis is a compact short book. Reminds me of Make Your Bed, by Admiral McRaven. This book is a shorter, different autobiographical narrative, but the same enthusiasm to succeed through personal and societal cliffs and valleys with a circle of others we trust.\n\nOverall enjoyed this book. I'd had it on the shelf since March. Felt compelled to #JustDoIt today. Glad I did. Felt a little like a sabbatical from books that usually take days.\n\nAlthough began in print, switched to Audible to be with the author one on one since Ms. Wambach is the narrator. Listening felt a great depth of relationship to her story and how it relates to me, the reader, and my journey.\n\nLike two friends hanging out. Teammates encouraging the other. Might sound weird, but for some authors I listen to this is the image I'm getting from them.\n\nIf you are a man or woman, either or this would be a great book to feel encouraged, tone-setting, an eight-point guidepost to reset for the goal post :)\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀",

    "A great little book, full of simple, intuitive and heartfelt advice and wisdom from a wonderful activist, advocate of equality and phenomenal sportswoman. So much admiration for Abby. Highly recommend this book, particularly for those with daughters. Let’s raise each other up!",
    "If your mind whirls about who and why and how…read this! Then read it again and try it, be brave and do it. Because we’re all waiting for you to show up. For all of us to show up, to ourselves and to the world. This will nudge you in the best way.",

    "The power of the collective, channeling the strength of your inner wolf are all concepts that Abby Wambach explores in such a light and a easy to follow manner; it really is a call for women to come together and lift each other up, to be sure of themselves and to continue demanding all our rights.",
    "Simple clear lessons that all women should read (and men)\nMessages that all make so much sense when Abby writes and explains\nWill be reading this again as a guide on how to live life every day\nThank you Abby",
    "I call this a toilet book because you can pick it up, absorb a chapter in 5 minutes, think and reflect.\n\nI loved it. It spoke my language but from a sporting mindset. I don't do sports book usually because it's a very male perspective. Abby is leading her pack from the front.",
    "I read this the same weekend that I read Untamed. I didn’t now of Abby (being a Scottish non football fan!) but became aware of her from her marriage to Glennon Doyle\n\nThe book is good the message is good - but the book is TINY.\n\nAbby please write more!!"

    "The polemicist Simon Foucher warned that, “we are dogma-prone from our mother’s wombs.” Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s philosophical work, The Black Swan, is truly a masterpiece that addresses this problem. At one point in the book, Taleb asserts that “the ultimate test of whether you like an author is if you’ve reread him”. Considering the fact that I’ve now read this book twice, it’s fair to say that I greatly admire Taleb’s work. Now on to the review.\n\n***\n\nIn “Part 1″, there is an interesting anecdote, that sets the tone for the rest of the book, about Umberto Eco’s library. Eco is a highly respected semiotician, essayist, philosopher, literary critic, and novelist. And he owns a library that reportedly contains over 30,000 books. He isn’t, however, known for being boastful about it. When guests come over to his house he usually gets one of two reactions. The vast majority of guests, according to Taleb, respond with something similar to the following “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” And then there are the people who get the point: “A large personal library is not an ego-boosting appendage, but a research tool.” The point of this story emphasizes a critical theme throughout the book, i.e., we overemphasize what we think we know and downplay how ignorant we really are. An antilibrary (representing things we don’t know) is more valuable to us than are the books we’ve already read (or things we already know).\n\nEarly on we also learn that Taleb classifies himself as a skeptical empiricist. And, you may be wondering, what exactly is a skeptical empiricist? “Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.”\n\nFor further clarification, empiricism is a theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge can only be ascertained exclusively via sensory experience. And skepticism, it’s important to note, comes in many different varieties. Taleb traces his skepticism back to its roots in the Pyrrhonian tradition. However, he is also fond of “Sextus the (Alas) Empirical” (better known as Sextus Empiricus) and David Hume. Taleb, however, is not entirely devoted to promoting rampant philosophical skepticism. He simply wants to be “a practitioner whose principal aim is to not be a sucker in things that matter, period.”\n\nLargely, then, this book is about epistemology, also known as the study of human knowledge. What can we truly know? And what are the limits of human knowledge? I think Taleb focuses one of the fundamental problems of philosophy, which the German Philosopher, Immanuel Kant, also wrote extensively about (although from a different perspective), i.e., what are the limits of our reason? Kant realized that examining human reason is inherently problematic, namely because when humans try to examine metaphysical or even epistemological issues we can never do so outside the bounds of our own reasoning ability. We’re suckers, blinded to reality, because we are trapped in our own human minds!\n\nThroughout the book, Taleb picks on the great thinker of antiquity, Plato. Taleb, however, also gives the impression that he is quite fond of the great philosopher too, despite his shortcomings. What Taleb calls Platonicity is the obsessive focus on the pure and well-defined aspects of reality, while ignoring the messier parts and less tractable structure that exist in reality. Perhaps an example of Platonicity might help clear up this distinction. A Platonified economist, for example, thinks that he can accurately model something as complex as the macroeconomy. Using foolish assumptions, the Platonified economist tries to assume conditions of reality (that don’t really exist) in order to fit her model rather than accepting that reality is far messier than the model. One who is a Platonic thinker, then, could also be classified as a nerd. Nerds, according to Taleb, believe that what cannot be Platonized and formally studied doesn’t exist, or isn’t worth considering.\n\nOne interesting example of Platonicity provided in the book pertains to breast milk. At one point in time, Platonified scientists believed that they had created a formula for a mother’s “milk” that was perfectly identical to a mother’s real milk. Alas, they could then manufacture this milk in a laboratory and make financial gains from it! Despite what appeared to be an identical chemical composition, there was empirical evidence showing increases in various cancers and other health problems in children who drank this fake-milk. Was this a coincidence? Perhaps. But it also could be that the Platonified scientific formula for milk was missing some crucial element of the milk that we cannot see!\n\nPlatoncitity can further be generalized as follows, “it is our tendency to mistake the map for the territory, to focus on well and pure defined “forms,” whether objects, like triangles, or social notions, like utopias (societies built according to some blueprint of what “makes sense”), even nationalities. “ In other words, a Platonified nerd is someone who visits New York City, but has with a map of San Francisco with them, and yet still thinks that their incorrect map will somehow help them. Taleb believes that we have a built-in tendency to trust our maps, even when they’re for the wrong location. Furthermore, we fail to realize that no map is often better than the wrong map.\n\nThe trouble is, according to Taleb, that we encourage nerd knowledge over other forms of knowledge, especially in academia. Nerds focus on what fits in the box, even if the most important things in life fall outside the box. The nerd simply neglects the antilibrary.\n\nAt one point in history it was considered “knowledge” that all swans are white. This was stated as a scientific fact because no black swans had ever been observed. However, this line of reasoning presents an interesting philosophical problem, i.e., “The Problem of Induction“. And the great philosopher, David Hume, wrote in great detail about this problem, although he wasn’t the first to do so.\n\nIn order to further understand this problem let’s consider the following classic inference that led to the problem: All swans we have seen are white, and therefore all swans are white. The problem is that even the observation of a billion white swans does not make that statement unequivocally true. This is because black swans may exist, we just haven’t observed one yet. We have obviously since discovered that black swans do indeed exist. What can we learn here? An over reliance on our observations can lead us astray.\n\nStill confused? Then, let’s consider what we can we learn from a turkey, which hopefully provides further clarification. The uberphilsopher Bertrand Russell illustrated this turkey example quite well.\n\nConsider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving it will incur a revision of belief.\n\nTaleb, then, states, “The turkey problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck.” Probably the most important point to note from the turkey is that our perceived knowledge from learning backwards may not just be worthless, but rather, it may actually be creating negative value by blinding us to future events with dire consequences.\n\nAs such, it’s certainly important to note that a series of corroborative facts is not necessarily evidence. But where does that leave us in terms of how we can know things? Well, Taleb further argues that we can know things that are wrong, but not necessarily correct (think Karl Popper’s falsifiability). This he calls negative empiricism. The sight of one black swan, then, can certify that not all swans are white, but the observation of a trillion white swans doesn’t give us any certifiable claims.\n\nStrangely, however, we humans have a tendency to ignore the possibility of silent evidence and look to confirm our theories, rather than challenge them.\n\nOne of the central tenets of the book is the distinction between “Mediocristan” and “Extremistan”, which are terms for different types of domains.. When you’re dealing with a domain that’s in Mediocristan, then your data will fit a Gaussian distribution (a bell curve). In Extremistan, however, you’re not dealing with data that is normally distributed. A single observation in Extremistan can have an incredible impact on the total. Think of the following example. If we took the average height of a million humans and then, say, added the tallest person in the world to the sample, the average wouldn’t be affected in a significant way. Height is normally distributed. Now imagine we did the same thing with wealth. Adding the richest person in the world to a sample of a million people would greatly affect the average. The distribution of height, then, falls within the domain of Mediocristan and things like wealth in Extremistan.\n\nOne of Taleb’s main points is that we often try to use the model that works in Mediocristan in Extremistan. Taleb states, however, that almost all social matters belong to Extremistan and that the casino is the only human venture where probabilities are known and almost computable. But even casinos aren’t immune to Extremistan — think about it.\n\nAnother interesting concept from the book is the “toxicity of knowledge.” Too much information can be toxic especially when it inflates the confidence in an “expert” prediction. More information is not always better; more is sometimes better, but not always. And we often blindly listen to experts in fields where there can be no experts.\n\nIf you follow Taleb’s argument, then reading the newspaper may actually decrease, rather than increase, your knowledge of the world. The Black Swan, however, will not only increase your understanding of the world, but it will make you wiser as well. For that reason, I can assure you that I will be rereading this book yet again at some point in the future.",
    "\"All swans are white\" was an unassailable truth up until the discovery of Australia — it was something everyone knew to be a fact. But it was neither true nor a fact. All it took was the sighting of one black swan in the new southern continent to turn the Old World upside down on its head. Taleb, a cagey Lebanese-born philosopher and thinker, has grabbed onto the \"black swan\" as a synecdoche for an abruptly appearing, totally unexpected event which has a great impact on the world, but for which the world conjures up ex post facto explanations which makes it all sound reasonable and predictable. Sure, antiseptic procedures for doctors sound reasonable today, but the black swan Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was imprisoned in a mental institution by the head of his hospital, even after his procedures had saved over a hundred-thousand women in Vienna from dying in childbirth! I have made a vocation of seeking out such black swan innovators, both those like Semmelweis whose contributions grace history books and some whom I have been fortunate to meet and or converse with, such as Immanuel Velikovsky, Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Joseph Newman, Andrew Joseph Galambos, Doyle Philip Henderson, and Kaisu Viikari. Those that I have met only through books constitute a longer list, and I will mention their names in case you wish to look up their contributions as outliers in their unique fields of innovation and discovery: Alfred Korzybski, Rudolf Steiner, Gregor Mendel, Owen Barfield, Anastasia, Barbara McClintock, Carlos Castaneda, Jane Roberts, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Watzlawick, Gregory Bateson, Richard Feynman, Robert Axelrod, and Thomas Paine, among others. It is only fitting that I add the author of this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, to the list of black swans I have met through books because his coined phrase black swan will echo down the halls of time, much as Tom Kuhn's word paradigm which he rescued from obscurity and pumped new life into in 1962.\nIn New Orleans in the Fall of 2005, my wife and I lived through the Black Swan known as Katrina. It appeared overnight and left in its wake a devastated metropolitan area. How did we react to Katrina? We restored our home on the West Bank and our fourplex apartments in New Orleans. I had ridden out Hurricane Betsy about 40 years before Katrina and seen the devastation left behind then, and I had heard of the Great Flood of 1927, about 40 years before Betsy. Knowing something about batting averages, it seems to me that the City of New Orleans needs a catastrophe about every 40 years. The first generation after the catastrophe remembers it and expects another catastrophe like it every year. The second generation only hears about it and never expects one, but the new third generation forty years later gets shook up by a new and unexpected catastrophe and the cycle starts over. I doubt that Taleb would accept my simple baseball metaphor of batting average for predicting a city's experience with catastrophes, but I offer it in the absence of any other explanation. It can bring a certain measure of comfort to those who might otherwise spend Spring through Fall of every year worrying about another Katrina.\nHere's how Taleb describes the dynamics of Black Swans and what might qualify as a Black Swan:\n[page viii] Just imagine how little your understanding of the world on the eve of the events of 1914 would have helped you guess what was to happen next. (Don't cheat by using the explanations drilled into your cranium by your dull high school teacher.) How about the rise of Hitler and the subsequent war? How about the precipitous demise of the Soviet bloc? How about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism? How about the spread of the Internet? How about the market crash of 1987 (and the more unexpected recovery)? Fads, epidemics, fashion, ideas, the emergence of art genres and schools. All follow these Black Swan dynamics. Literally, just about everything of significance around you might qualify.\nThis combination of low predictability and large impact makes the Black Swan a great puzzle; but that is not yet the core concern of this book. Add to this phenomenon the fact that we tend to act as if it does not exist! I don't mean just you, your cousin Joey, and me, but almost all \"social scientists\" who, for over a century, have operated under the false belief that their tools could measure uncertainty.\nTaleb's forté is the world of finance and economics, and his advice is that no advice from anyone can predict Black Swans. He even gives you a way of discovering this truth he offers, an operation that many of you can easily perform to ascertain how oblivious the best informed experts in the world are to Black Swans.\n[page xviii] . . . the applications of the sciences of uncertainty to real-world problems has had ridiculous effects; I have been privileged to see it in finance and economics. Go ask your portfolio manager for his definition of \"risk,\" and odds are that he will supply you with a measure that excludes the possibility of the Black Swan — hence one that has no better predictive value for assessing the total risks than astrology (we will see how they dress up the intellectual fraud with mathematics). This problem is endemic in social matters.\nDo you begin to feel as if a rug has been pulled out from under you, causing you to lose your level of comfort in the world? If not, you have not yet understood the problem, and you may gently pull yourself away from this review, dear Reader, and return to your favorite illusory world where Black Swans don't exist, where the world is uniform, slowly changing, and where manufacturing gasoline pumps will always be a prosperous business to invest in. You and I live in a world where no Black Swan will suddenly pop up to make oil a useless black goo best left underground.\nTaleb begins the meat of the book talking about Umberto Eco's Antilibrary, which he defines as the unread books on the shelves of Eco's 30,000 volume library, the research volumes. Like my visitors, people would come into Eco's home and notice the size of his library and ask him how many of the books he's read, as if that were the sole reason for owning a library, to read every book. That concept of antilibrary goes to the heart of Taleb's profession as he deems himself to be a skeptical empiricist.\n[page 2] Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.\nBefore we actually reach the first page of Chapter One, we know all about Taleb in a thumbnail sketchy way so that we are well-prepared for the main course which will flesh out the menu explanations he has shared with us during his impressive Prologue. I don't know about you, but I wanted to order and digest every meal on his menu and was well-satisfied with my dining experience with him as I closed the book.\nI cannot tell all the many things I learned in this book, nor do I intend to try. We live in a world full of people who believe that eventually computers will figure out everything and predict everything which is going to happen. These are people who have not read or digested the material of this book, which is indeed an eponymous Black Swan among books and as such will likely be unread and misunderstood when read. Gregory Bateson, a Black Swan among thinkers and an eminent cyberneticist, was asked once by a student, \"Professor Bateson, how will we know when computers have reached the level of human intelligence?\" Bateson thought for a minute and answered, \"We will ask the computer a question, and it will answer, 'That reminds me of a story.'\" As Taleb writes on page xxvi of his Prologue, \"Ideas come and go. Stories stay.\" Computers will never answer any questions with stories, and thus will never provide anything lasting, but Nassim Nicholas Taleb has provided a monument to his skeptical empiricism which will stand for all time to come. He explains to us what it means to be human in an inhuman world and how to survive given the reality of Black Swans. To learn more you can read Bobby Matherne's DIGESTWORLD Issue#11c.",
    "an interesting concept and worth reading as thought provoking. However, I think the writing could have been more concise and less ponderous. The same message and information delivered in fewer pages. Some passages are a bit laborious.",
    "Brilliant",
    "A great read for mathematically inclined bourgeoisie, but for us peasants it can be a little dense and convoluted. Presenting big ideas in a logical fashion that seem to carry weight in the day to day life of the \"everyman\", this book offers more of a perspective enhancement than it does a practical means to acheive to the improbable yet high-yielding outcomes it spends a great deal of time exploring. Nonetheless, Taleb exudes personality on every page - like a punk-rock statistician of sorts - and the book is surprisingly easy to read even during the numerous instances where the \"get to the point\" vibe sets in.",
    "I enjoyed the book, and it has a lot of very good interesting ideas, but I found it a challenging read. Quite pithy, but some concepts take effort and time to unpack, not being quite genius level. There are several realizations to take away, and I have used examples from the book in discussions and explanations with friends and co-workers. The book challenges many common assumptions, esp. about likelihood and risk. In short: many good ideas, and worth the effort. Amazing number of cross references to other books.",
    "Wer meint, die Welt sei berechenbar und die Materialisation der Gausschen-Glockenkurve sei das Mass der Dinge könnte sich irren. Taleb ist ohne Zweifel einer der wenigen \"Genial-Bekloppten\" des Planeten und ein \"Nerd\" der Premiumklasse. Die Aufbereitung des Themas \"Wahrscheinlichkeit\" ist ohne Beispiel und sollte jeden berühren, der sich von rein akademischer Stochastik verschaukelt fühlt. In Zeiten, wo Klimabesorgte mathematische Gewissheit in Gauss-Funktionen suchen eine echte Alternative in Perspektive. Ein sogenanntes \"le must\"😉 Ein Punkt Abzug für seine biographischen selbszentrierten Knallerbsen."

    "Great shape!",
    "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is a businessman, investor, and an author best known for his Rich Dad series. He talks about why financial literacy is important, as well as ways readers can be financially educated, and showing the way to become financially secure. He is confident about his writing while being informative and inspirational. He states “Anybody can be rich if they have the correct financial literacy.” He gives hope to his readers to be financially successful, as he even encouraged me to change the way I spend my money while reading this book.\n\nAs a teenager, there are a lot of pieces of information that I never heard of that made me think deeply. Although this book’s audiences are parents or adults who want to be financially successful and to educate their children to be so too, it is a must read for all teenagers, both male and female, because financial education is something all people have to learn when they start to manage their own money. It is even ironic that most schools don’t teach financial literacy because it is a skill set all people have to know. A few people might use their chemistry knowledge they learned in high school, but everybody would have to manage money. (money is what we need to live!)\n\nLike I said previously, there was a large number of things I did not know, some I thought were controversial to some people. One of them was his claim that told the readers that rich people don’t work hard for money, they make money work for them.\n\nI was told by many people, including my parents and teachers, that if you put in a tremendous amount of effort in your work, then money will someday come to you. This made sense because I thought this “work hard for money” principle made up the whole society. However, Robert Kiyosaki’s claim throughout the book was that rich people made money work for them instead of working for money.\n\nHis claim made absolutely no sense to me especially because I grew up my entire life watching my dad go through tough labor, trying to earn enough money to support the family. Back in Japan where I used to live, I saw many businessmen riding on a train while wearing the same black suits, boringly attached to their smartphones during the morning rush. From my perspective, it seemed like they were repeating the same thing every day and they were just tired of working so much. I see many college students studying really hard to get a certain degree so that they can secure a decent job. Growing up around these people, I naturally thought working hard was the key to financial success, what made rich people rich. However, his claim of “making money work for them” just turned the world upside down for me.\n\nIn each chapter, there were one or two topics that made me confused or simply couldn’t understand since the ideas were so new to me. For example, the concept of asset versus liability is the most confusing but important information, therefore one should focus extra hard when reading those sections. While reading this book, I suggest readers to be open-minded, have the will to listen, and don’t reject everything he says. I understand that some concepts he teaches are new to most people, but most of them will be clear as the book moves on.\n\nDespite the fact that the original copy being published in 1997, there are many skills, philosophy, knowledge, and principle in this book that still apply up to this date. I can definitely say that this book is not outdated and this book has the potential to help change many people’s lives. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great way to start your journey in becoming rich! I highly recommend picking up this book especially if you are a high school or college student.",
    "Many valuable lessons in Rich Dad, Poor Dad help get people on better financial footing. The sections on income tax were very enlightening. It encourages everyone to have at least one business, even it is a home / hobby business, in order to avoid income taxes. The rich don't pay income taxes! Those tips alone were worth the price of the book.\nReview by Becky Brinkley, author of Diary of an Early Retiree: How You Can Do It Step by Step",
    "Great product",
    "My whole family read this book and applied it to our own financial planning and budgeting.

Nonetheless, I didn't have all of the information captured in this book. If I had I would have been more successful and would have likely built a sizeable and strong multifamily property portfolio.

    "To be frank, this COULD serve well as your first ever book in real estate investing as many of the lessons here could easily apply to single family homes in addition to small-multifamily properties. That said, Brandon Turner's \"The Book on Rental Property Investing\" is still the best first book. As someone who personally is getting ready to step up my game from the 2x single-family properties I own into the world of multifamily, this book was super-helpful. So much great advice here and well-worth the cover price. I'd argue that their calculators on how to estimate maintenance and CapEx costs alone is worth the cost of admission. Truly an essential read for anyone like me who is ready to take that next step in their rental property journey.",

They provide real examples of pro forma with the spread sheets to back it up. Very specific accounting and tax information is also provided. I really appreciated the real life examples and anecdotes that made it obvious these guys really do \"walk the walk\". And lastly, very refreshing they did not use the latest common book format of constantly repeated the same couple things over and over just to increase page count. Every page of this book added valuable information.",

  "reviews": [
    "Robert Cialdini is the person who may have a greater influence on the theory and practice of the principles of persuasion for the next ten years. Robert Cialdini is honest and ethical.",
    "This topic is just fascinating - the hidden pushes and pulls that affect our decision making, even when we believe we are reasoning. One such example (p.146) is the 1974 Canadian study that found politicians who were more attractive got 2.5 times the number of votes. Despite the evidence of favoritism, 73% of Canadian voters denied \"in the strongest possible terms\" that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14% even admitted the possibility! (See the study by Efran & Patterson, 1976 and another by Budesheim & DePaola, 1994.)\n\nThe book does a wonderful job of keeping the subject light despite that it is chock full of references to studies. There are even cartoons are scattered throughout the chapters. Pictures from real life also are mixed in. Included are \"defenses\" that are meant to help us avoid the pitfalls, but I'm not sure they'll be entirely helpful or not because I personally thought a lot of these tactics would be very obvious to me. Summaries of the chapters are included, which serve as good refreshers if it's been a while since you've read the book (and need to write an Amazon review :] ).\n\nI think even anyone with a healthy dose of cynicism or business sense will read this and be surprised that these tactics work. One such example is of Detroit's Joe Girard, deemed greatest car salesman by Guinness Book of World Records for selling an average of 5 cars per day, who describes a technique he used: every month he sent a holiday greeting card (for Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving, whatever) to each of his 13,000 customers, with nothing but the words \"I like you\" and his signed name. (p.150) \"Could a statement of liking so impersonal, obviously designed to sell cars, really work?: Joe Girard thought so, and a man as successful as he was at what he did deserves our attention.\" It was at least one of the techniques he used to earn himself hundreds of thousands of dollars per year as a car salesman.\n\nThere's only one bit I came across in this entire book that I disagreed with, and it was from the chapter on authority, in which the author claims that normally authority figures (specifically and namely included are politicians and doctors) have earned the right to have \"the word\" on subjects they speak on. Politicians? Ha! Doctors? Like the ones who vouched for smoking being healthy when cigarettes came out? Think again.  Trust Us We're Experts: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles with Your Future  Other than that one tiny bit that caught my eye, the rest of the book is very informative and even fun to read.\n\nI'll leave you with one unbelievable example from the very beginning that tells how a shop owner accidentally relieved herself of the trouble of selling a certain variety of turquoise jewelry. She left a note instructing her employee to reduce them to 1/2 price. The employee misread and raised the price by 2 instead; the pieces sold almost immediately. This is due to the fact that people without better knowledge of a particular good will use the price alone to determine the quality or value of that good. This also worked for Chivas Regal Scotch Whiskey, which was a struggling brand until it's owners decided to raise its price substantially above its competitors!",
    "\"Influence\" by Robert Cialdini is one of the most wonderful and influential books I've ever read! Other books have been written on the topic, but Cialdini's is the best and most influential of them all.\n\n\"Influence\" deals with the study of persuasion, compliance, and change - a subject that has application for every area of life. Cialdini presents the latest research on influence in a compelling way, clearly stating the 6 principles of influence and providing wonderful illustrations of each principle from advertising, psychology and other fields. If we understood these 6 principles better, we would be less subject to manipulation from others (for example, the manipulation to buy things we don't need or to buy more than we need). We might, in turn, also be able to understand how to influence others for good.\n\nThe 6 principles of influence are:\n\n1. The Rule of Reciprocation: \"We should try to repay in kind what another person has provided us.\"\n\n2. Commitment and Consistency: \"Once we make a choice or take a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.\"\n\n3. Social Proof: \"We determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct.\"\n\n4. Liking: \"We most prefer to say yes to the requests of people we know and like.\"\n\n5. Authority - we have a deep-seated sense of duty to authority\n\n6. Scarcity - something is more valuable when it is less available\n\nI find that in my own life, these 6 principles are remarkably powerful and have the ability to explain a lot of the behavior I observe as a father, teacher, and priest. We would all benefit from memorizing and mastering these six principles. They are simple but extremely powerful. My daughter read this book when she was 14 or 15, and I had to wrestle with her to get it back because she loved it so much! I only hope she doesn't begin using the principles against me!\n\nOne of the best parts of the book is the wonderful examples of each principle that Cialdini provides. An experiment to demonstrate the principle of authority, conducted by Stanley Milgram, is the classic example. In this experiment, two volunteers show up to help with an experiment, purportedly to test the effect of punishment on learning and memory. A researcher in a lab coat with a clipboard explains the experiment to the volunteers and that one is to take the role of the Teacher, who will administer increasingly higher levels of electric shock to the other volunteer, the Learner. Every time the Learner got a question incorrect, the Teacher was to administer a higher level of shock. However, the real experiment was to test how willing the Teacher was to administer pain to the innocent Learner, who was not really another volunteer but an actor pretending to be in increasing stages of pain. The results shocked everyone, for Milgram discovered that about two-thirds of the subjects were willing to administer the highest level of electric shock. The reason? Their deep-seated duty to authority.\n\nInfluence is filled with many such fascinating and useful examples of how our lives are influenced by others. I highly recommend the book to all readers, for influence is something common to us all, for good or for evil.",
    "Really wanted to put a higher grade to this book but:\n1/ Book presentation is quite bad. It is not a competition to put so much content in one page. Poor presentation is surprising on a book on persuasion!\n2/ Overall it is very dry.\n\nIt is really a pity as content is very informative and examples are often entertaining. With a bit of editing work, I would have put 4 stars.\n\nI went through the entire book and was happy when I finished it. I found out this book thanks to Scott Adams.",
    "Das Buch gibt einen sehr guten Einblick in die menschliche Denkweise. Die vielen plastischen Beispiele helfen das zu verstehen und zu verinnerlichen. Lieferzeit war über ein Monat und das Buch wurde fünf Tage später als versprochen geliefert. Der Händler bietet sehr rudimentäres Track & Trace an. Allerdings war der Preis dafür attratktiv.",
    "If you are in the business of selling something or convincing others to take action, this book is invaluable. You will need to re-read it and make notes to get the full benefit of the book. Many internet gurus cite this book and it's easy to see why!",
    "Really good book. Makes you aware of a lot of things, even if you don't actively use them yourself - helps you be aware of people using the same tactics against you. Very important skills to learn. I would highly recommend this book for everyone. It's written in an interesting way that makes you want to actually keep reading.",
    "A must for all sales professionals, or anybody who would want to be more persuasive (which is everybody!!). This book has concrete examples, scientifically proven, on how people react depending on each situations. A two thumbs up recommendation."

    "Good read. Life lesson",
    "Florence Shinn was really onto something with her Theo philosophical way of living and trusting in God the Giver - God the Gift wanting us to ask and have faith that in time our prayers will be answered by CHRIST. One must live in the present and be positive with imaging and relationships. She shows us how Jesus wants to be faithful his grace will pour down upon us. This book has changed my entire way of living life for the better.",
    "1 of the most impactful Books I have read, I highly recommend this to anyone on a journey of seeking to tap into our highest being.",
    "I appreciated her enthusiasm and motivation and testimonies and the way she has such surety of everything she wrote in her book. It was a nice perspective to consider.",
    "I learned a little more about having faith, acting in faith in God in the universe in order to manifest. Everything starts with a thought. Stay positive.",

    "Enjoyable book with good tips for public speaking skills",
    "Very entertaining but sometimes difficult to read. More time could be spent on teach \"how\" to implement different techniques. It provides several illustrations, but this is no doubt an art.",
    "This book was instructive for anyone wanting to improve their speaking ability. The reference to prior Ted talk speakers gives someone an opportunity to watch the Ted talk and gain added knowledge through visual observation",
    "I'll preface this by saying that books written by business coaches/consultants usually annoy the heck out of me, as they are generally filled with narcissistic self-references and do a horrendous job summarizing actual scientific findings. To some extent, this book does the same. But while other such books usually garner 1-star reviews from me, \"Talk Like Ted\" has its redeeming qualities. As many others have noted, this could have been a much, much shorter book; as such, I recommend taking what you need from it and skipping the rest, as it's easy to get the point of each chapter by the first one-third of it. I liked the main point each chapter provides, but I felt like they fell short on application. For example, in Chapter 1, Gallo repeats over and over again the importance of passion, but does nothing to provide guidance on how the reader can find such passion. I guess this reflects his lack of knowledge of the science behind such principles. Despite all of the shortcomings of this book, though, I do believe a reader can sort through it for things to apply to one's own presentation opportunities. At the very least, while nothing in this book is cutting edge knowledge, it does contain enough reminders that can escape our consciousness after a while.",
    "Reluctantly, I confess that my intent to improve my speaking/communication skills coupled with my interest in joining one of the local Toastmasters inspired me to purchase Talk Like Ted; The 9 Public Speaking Secrets of The World’s Top Minds by Carmine Gallo. Additionally, this book purchase is inspired by a circumstance where someone who I admire diplomatically gave me some shocking but helpful feedback when they expressed how they can see me soar even more as a person if I could find a way to align my speaking style with my writing voice. Anyhow the following are some of the detailed features of Talk Like Ted; a public speaking profile about Colin Powells (pages 92-94 under Have A Conversation), a snapshot of a Pink Concert (pages 156-157 under Deliver Jaw Dropping Moments), and the 18 minute rule as it ties into creativity (pages 188-189). The book also features various arenas with pop culture subjects as it ties into the area of speaking ( a feature of Bono from U2 on page 218, the feature of 32,000 Barbie dolls on pages 220-221, and a discussion on kinesthetic touch with a person (Dr. Elliott Krane on page 235) using a blowtorch during their TED talk etc.).",
    "The author interviews the top TED speakers and they share what they have learned and how to tell great stories.",
    "Is good for just one time",
    "Gallo's in-depth analysis of the best speakers of our time is a superb resource sure to up your public speaking game. Last fall I drew heavily on it while preparing and delivering a Veterans Day presentation for two local middle schools. \"Tell stories\" and \"use emotionally potent examples\" served as my guiding principles, and they made everything easier to remember, more fun to deliver, and more pleasurable for the audience to receive.\n\nThis isn't a basic how-to for novice speakers, but it doesn't claim to be. For comprehensive coverage of the nuts and bolts basics, consider Carnegie's timeless classic, The Art of Public Speaking (its copyright is expired, and so can be found online for free), or for more concise coverage of the same, consider my  The Best Public Speaking Book: How to Conquer Nervousness, Polish Your Authentic Stage Self, Develop & Deliver Dynamite Presentations . (When I revise The Best Public Speaking Book, Gallo will be cited for sure!)\n\nThanks for the excellent book, Gallo! You and Brian Tracy have helped take my public speaking game to the next level, and Talk Like Ted is a resource I anticipate revisiting many times.",
    "I came across this book preparing for my first ever inspirational speech. 6 months prior to the date (!!!!!) I was already starting to freak out about meeting 40-odd teenagers. Teenagers, who were (not) expecting to be inspired and convinced, that WORK is actually good (!!??!!) for them... I saw stretched out necks from the back row and complete silence, when I lowered my voice. I saw eyes, following every single movement of my hands. Needless to say, I sold my story.\n\nThis book inspired me and helped me fully prepare for that and many other presentations along the way. A MUST read to anyone who talks to people.",
    "I love watching TED talks and I have been watching TED talks for well over 10 years. I always marvel at some of the best presentations given on the platform. How the speaker was able to make the audience laugh on cue or have the room filled with silence yet everyone is leaning forward full engaged.\n\nTo succeed in the corporate world, one must learn the act of presentations. How to tell stories that move people. The book gives great anecdotes regarding the prep or behind the scenes of some of these world famous TED talks. Would highly recommend this book for any keen to improve their communication, story telling and presentation skills .",
    "I had a presentation to build for work and watched a few TED talks for inspiration. Then I saw this book…..\n\nIt’s fantastic. Walks you simply through how a great talk should be structured, flow and be presented, based around the best talks there have been.\n\nThus, my presentation I had built with PowerPoint originally now looks nothing like the finished product, which I delivered with great success. The confidence this book gave me to present in front of people is immeasurable. So if you ever need to stand up in front of people to present, and that just maybe team meetings at work, or in a promotion interview then take a look at this book. You won’t regret it.",
    "I have taken several courses on public speaking, speaking to inspire and others, and this one book blew them all away. When you sit down to read this, make sure you’ve got a highlighter and notepad as you’ll be making changes to everything you do to present your ideas. I can’t wait to read it again and get even more from it.",
    "I have an utter fear of public speaking - like, how on earth am I supposed to entertain and inform people for 20 minutes?! Turns out there's a formula that works! This book has been invaluable in helping me to craft my talks (which have all been really well received!) and help me to get my head around the whole experience.\n\nI found it particularly helpful to break down the parts of a talks that I've found brilliant in the past - decipher why it was brilliant and start to hone my own stories. Would fully recommend it to just about anyone who's interested in nailing public speaking."

    "The book has a good condition as it is described. It's like almost new. Shipping was quick. It was arrived eariler than expected.",
    "I bought this book to better understand \"the economy.\" I'll be honest, I was completely ignorant. I was a biology major in college and never took a single class in humanities or business. At 35 years old, I'm realizing how big of a mistake that was. Nonetheless, this is an AMAZING textbook! After reading each chapter and doing every single practice problem and quiz, I now know economics better than, I would say, 99% of the population--that's speculation, of course, and maybe even a bit exaggerated but, hopefully, you get what I'm saying. Enlightened doesn't begin to describe the way I feel. I honestly feel like I know how the world works; it's even allowed me to better understand how the media--as well as those in politics--have no idea what they are doing; and how \"good intentions\" can sometimes have disastrous outcomes. The biggest thing this book helped me realize, though, is that so many of us go around thinking we know way more than we actually do. (I was most certainly one of those people.)\n\nIncentives are very real; the law of supply and demand is very real; and the only way for any of us to truly understand how the world works and how we can \"fix\" it, first and foremost, we must educate ourselves. This book is an excellent starting point!!!\n\nLast words: I think EVERYONE should read both a philosophy textbook (to better understand from where our values and principles come) and an economics textbook (to better understand how the world works--as opposed to how we *think* it works).",
    "The books were just as described. I am very satisfied.",
    "Economics is, unfortunately, one of the most politicized academic disciplines. Unlike the natural sciences and most of the other social sciences, there is often little concensus even among experts as to what can be considered sound theory. This is particularly the case in the field of macroeconomics.\n\nThat said, Mankiw does his best to present a fair and balanced approach to both micro- and macroeconomics. He leans to the right politically, having served under George W. Bush and worked for Mitt Romney, but you will seldom find such a well written textbook. This is an excellent place to begin your study of economics.",
    "Had all the pages, although some of the first few were basically ripped out when I got them, so they were constantly falling out. No writing in the book though. It did it’s job. Did not try the mindtap code because I didn’t need it.",
    "This is one of the best Economics textbook ever published, I got it in the mail today, it arrived on time, thank you Amazon.",
    "A great book well put together and easy to use.",
    "The author does a good job of presenting the material. I like how the book will introduce an idea, show an accompanying graph to illustrate the idea, and then the author will fully explain every feature of the graph. He provides his rationale for every supposition made, so that there is no ambiguity in your understanding of each topic.\n\nHowever, I don't think the book is as objective as it should be. I think the author included a fair bit of normative economics in here, when an intro to economics textbook should be comprised of positive statements, mostly. Let students form their own ideas about economic theory -- just provide them with the facts. I feel like the author was trying to push his political/economic opinions onto the reader, especially in the first few chapters.",
    "Pirate copy of book!! Smell like curry",
    "Book in perfect condition, fast shipping. Very satisfied!",
    "Formidable. Facile à comprendre.",
    "This introduction book covers widely issues, which might not be useful for economics courses only. The cases example is more useful for observation in daily life rather than in classroom."

We have now included this in our program for all our leaders.",
    "overall a good read. Only negative, it seems designed to get you to use their larger program which would be a large purchase. But I did think it was worth it overall.",
    "I liked the simplicity of the message- this was a quick read. As with Wickman’s other books about the EOS- (Traction and Get a Grip), there are useful forms included and helpful lists and exercises to lead and manage others. This book will be most useful for entrepreneurs who want to be great leaders and managers of people in their organizations, and likely don’t have HR professionals on staff to advise them. The only reason I didn’t rank this a 5 is that I am a tough rater, and this didn’t include any new information for me- it covers the basics, so is a good refresher for some who already know these principles.",
    "I wish more people read this before becoming a boss. It was a good book",
    "Great book with great insight fir a new manager!",
    "Like many of the other books related to the Entreprenuerial Operating System (EOS), it contains a lot of the same information. So if you have read Traction, Rocket Fuel, etc. you will find a lot is repeated. That said, as a new integrator in a small company that has been implimenting the EOS system over the last few years, I'm a big fan of the EOS model and think a few more dollars for another book to help round out your EOS tool set is well worth it. Our company's visionary and I have started discussing chapter by chapter the contents of this book.",
    "Clean, concise and stimulating. The book is direct in its approach, focusing on engagement and execution. Well written and powerful",
    "Great leadership book!",
    "O ponto negativo do livro é que é em inglês, então quem não tem intimidade com a língua pode não aproveitar muito, porém não precisa ser fluente, o livro não usa termos técnicos e já seguindo a linha de Gino Wickman, ele usa uma linguagem simples e objetiva, o que facilita a leitura para os que tem inglês intermediário e avançado.\n\nO livro já começa quebrando uma barreira minha sobre o termo chefe, eu que não gostava muito de ser chamado assim, passei a ter simpatia, originário do holandês. “Baas” é usado para a pessoa que está liderando como uma forma de respeito. Mas veja que ele é usado pelo liderado e não pelo líder. Você pode se chamar de gerente, diretor, presidente, mas não de chefe, isso cabe ao seu liderado te identificar como tal.\n\nLeitura para todos os gestores. Iniciantes irão tirar ótimos aprendizados. Experientes se não tiver aprendizados, com certeza gostarão da leitura para reforçar alguns valores e encontrar um pouco de combustível para realizar essa desafiadora missão de liderar.\n\nÓtima leitura!!!",

Renault was controlled by the French government which was problematic in and of itself. As leader of both companies Mr. Ghosn was trying to ride two wild horses. His interaction with Arab cultures allowed Mr. Ghosn to be highly (if not quite legally) compensated as an outstanding leader. Fascinating and fast paced read about how it all came tumbling down. His escape from Japan in the music box is well portrayed. I hope there will be a sequel or a movie.",

    "A well researched and written account of Ghosn’s rise and fall in the auto industry. Not a biography but an interesting telling of how the once capable captain of industry becoming wanted fugitive. The writers are no judgements but telling the story as it is. The narrative is so riveting the book reads and flows like a novel, but many lessons about the corporate executives, their motivation, greed and ambitions are related effortlessly and seamlessly. A most ennoble read."

    "Parker Palmer’s graceful little book LET YOUR LIFE SPEAK is the best work I’ve ever read on discernment and vocation.\n\nIn six chapters and just under 120 elegantly written pages, Palmer presses home the point that vocation emerges from within us and that we must listen carefully to our own lives if we are to discover it. Taking on someone else’s concept of calling or subjecting ourselves to an external and alien set of values and objectives will do violence to ourselves and to our usefulness—Palmer would probably avoid the word—to our community and our world. Throughout, the author’s rooting in Quaker patterns and rhythms is evident, but this book is anything but sectarian and will be welcomed—indeed, has been welcomed, for it was published in the year 2000—by readers of many faiths and perhaps of none.\n\nChapter I, ‘Listening to Life’, argues that one’s life is worthy of study and profoundly worth listening to. ‘The soul is like a wild animal—tough, resilient, savvy, self-sufficient, and yet exceedingly shy. If we want to see a wild animal, the last thing we should do is go crashing through the woods, shouting for the creature to come out. But if we are willing to walk quietly into the woods and sit silently for an hour or two at the base of a tree, the creature we are waiting for may well emerge, and out of the corner of an eye we will catch a glimpse of the precious wildness we seek.’\n\nIn his second chapter (‘Now I Become Myself’), Palmer initiates in earnest the autobiographical transparency that he will sustain through the book, lending to his lines an authenticity that is arguably their most compelling feature. After having tried and failed over several episodes to forge a sense of vocational and personal identity, Parker writes that ‘(t)today I understand vocation quite differently—not as a goal to be achieved but as a gift to be received. Discovering vocation does not mean scrambling toward some prize just beyond my reach but accepting the treasure of true self I already possess. Vocation does not come from a voice “out there” calling me to become something I am not. It comes from a voice “in here” calling me to be the person I was born to be, to fulfill the original selfhood given me at birth by God.’\n\nThe author urge us not to ‘wear other people’s faces’ and to realize that ‘(t)he deepest vocational question is not “What ought I to do with my life?” It is the more elemental and demanding “Who am I? What is my nature?”.’\n\nYet Palmer does not imagine that this discovery of one’s true self occurs often without pain. ‘Most of us’, he avers, ‘arrive at a sense of self and vocation only after a long journey through alien lands … before we come to that center, full of light, we must travel in the dark. Darkness is not the whole of the story—every pilgrimage has passages of loveliness and joy—but it is the part of the story most often left untold.’ This ultimate qualifier is another item that, to this reader’s ears, lends the ring of truth to Palmer’s adventure. I say this because my own journeying after true vocation has, like Palmer’s, led me through both sunlight and darkness, yet I cannot say that any of the miles traveled has been entirely dark, entirely bleak, and certainly not entirely regrettable. Unlike many more mechanical treatments of the topic, Palmer’s notion of vocational discovery leads him to value the path rather than merely the destination.\n\nOne finds, in this second and longest of Palmer’s chapters, refreshingly important roles to be played by fear, failure, and ordinariness. In my view, this makes LET YOUR LIFE SPEAK accessible to those of us who resonate with Palmer’s journey but could never write so elegantly of our own.\n\nChapter III is titled ‘When Way Closes’. The missing article is not a typo, but rather a nod to the Quaker sense of ‘Way’. In the discourse of the Friends, we learn, ‘way opens’ and ‘way closes’. Palmer traces a givenness to vocation, a created anchoring in our persons that does not make all things possible. Instead, the way each of us is both opens doors and closes doors. Sometimes the closing brings embarrassment and shame.\n\n‘It would be nice if our limits did not reveal themselves in such embarrassing ways as getting fired from a job. But if you are like me and don’t readily admit your limits, embarrassment may be the only way to get your attention. I go on full alert only when I am blocked or get derailed or flat-out fail. Then, finally, I may be forced to face my nature and find out whether I can make something of both my gifts and my limitations.’\n\nPalmer develops the role played by our limitations by counterposing the ‘oughts’ that we often heed in our vocational adventure to the ‘ecology of life’ in which we find a proper place to stand and to be. In this third chapter, this Christian reader finds the theological undergirding to Palmer’s prose that the author often touches upon only lightly. It is, for Palmer, the ‘God of reality’ who ‘dwells quietly in the root system of the very nature of things’. He speaks easily of ‘one’s created nature’. When one finally comes to rest within this ecology burnout is not the inevitable outcome of passionate labor. Rather, ‘(w)hen the gift I give to the other is integral to my own nature, when it comes from a place of organic reality within me, it will renew itself—and me—even as I give it away.’\n\n‘All the Way Down’ (Chapter IV) suggests that an excruciating read lies just ahead and the title does not deceive, for in this fourth chapter Palmer sketches out for us his two debilitating experiences of depression. Neither reducing nor simplifying the causes of depression—in fact he calls the thing a ‘mystery’—Palmer managed in his own suffering to find his way to viewing depression as his friend. It took him all the way down to where it was safe to stand. Following upon his previous description of ‘the God of reality’, Parker borrows Tillich’s description of God as the ground of being: ’I had always imagined God to be in the same general direction was everything else I valued: up … I had to be forced underground before I could understand that the way to God is not up but down.’\n\nThankfully, Palmer does not write prescriptively about the ways (plural) into depression nor the ways (again, note the plural) out. His own recovery remains something of a mystery, captured in the magnificent poem with which he graces the conclusion of Chapter IV. Yet for him, his submission to the vocational ‘oughts’ by which he permitted himself for years to be hounded prepared the way down in the darkness. There he found not only God, but himself as well.\n\nChapter V (‘Leading from Within’) now turns outward to the damage and the health that a leader can bring to the wider community and, indeed, to the world. We project both shadows and light onto the world. ‘A good leader is intensely aware of the interplay of inner shadow and light, lest the act of leadership do more harm than good.’\n\nIn this chapter, any hint that vocation is essentially a narcissistic pursuit evaporates. For Palmer, vocation begins within but eventually projects itself onto one’s world. He writes insightfully of the ways leaders fashion a community from misguided starting points and, happily, also via the freedom that comes from authentic vocation. Let me single out at some length a few of Parker’s words on fear as motivator:\n\n‘As one who is no stranger to fear, I have had to read those words with care so as not to twist them into a discouraging counsel of perfection. “Be not afraid” does not mean we cannot have fear. Everyone has fear, and people who embrace the call to leadership often find fear abounding. Instead, the words say we do not need to be the fear we have. We do not have to lead from a place of fear, thereby engendering a world in which fear is multiplied.\n\nWe have places of fear inside of us, but we have other places as well—places with names like trust and hope and faith. We can choose to lead from one of those places, to stand on ground that is not riddled with the fault lines of fear, to move toward others from a place of promise instead of anxiety. As we stand in one of those places, fear may remain close at hand and our spirits may still tremble. But now we stand on ground that will support us, ground from which we may lead others towards a more trustworthy, more hopeful, more faithful way of being in the world.’\n\nThis reviewer—like Palmer, no stranger to fear—thrills to such a sound and realistic assessment of the kind of ‘fearlessness’ that embraces reality and yet dares to lead, unparalyzed.\n\nIn his concluding chapter (VI, ‘There is a Season’), Palmer departs from his now familiar approach to speak of how ‘the quest for selfhood and vocation’ follow the recurring patterns and rhythms of the four seasons. This chapter alone would justify keeping Let Your Life Speak within arm’s reach, to be read and re-read at the calendar’s and the seasons’ turnings.\n\nOne can hardly read Palmer’s exceedingly transparent work on vocation and then write for others about it without a bit of transparency of his own. After twelve years of leadership in a relatively prominent position—at least for the proportions of this review’s little world—I recently hit the wall at the end of a particularly grueling vocational mile. This is not without its emotional violence, its sense of failure and disillusionment, its return to the root considerations of vocational identity, and its forceful requirement to look again and to look within for wisdom about next steps. For me, each page of Palmer’s LET YOUR LIFE SPEAK brought both balm and direction. Many brought exhilaration as well.\n\nI offer this review in hopes that Palmer will be a bit more widely read for those, like me, who find a wise mentor the doctor’s very order.",
    "Review on \"Let Your Life Speak\" by Parker Palmer\n\nParker Palmer's book, Let Your Life Speak: Listening for the Voice of Vocation (2000) is an incredible self-reflection on the concept of vocation. Drawing on his own experiences, Palmer offers an intimate and honest analysis of his personal story in finding fulfillment, which will aid the reader in determining his or her own course in life. With the sage advice that only comes from a traveler who has trekked the way before, Palmer acts as a guide to vocation by showing the way with the wisdom gained from the walk on his own path.\n\nInstead of the traditional understanding of vocation as some outward call, Palmer advocates that vocation is really a voice and a vision that comes from within. He writes that \"Before you tell your life what you intend to do with it, listen for what it intends to do with you\" (p. 3). This idea of listening to self, care of self, and inner self is not only illustrated through the life of the author but also in quotes and vignettes of spiritual and social leaders like Henri Nouwen, Fredrick Buechner, Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, and Rosa Parks. Likewise, Palmer draws on his education and community organizer background as well as his Quaker faith and poetry to highlight these lessons. With complete transparency, vulnerability, and humility, Palmer explains how living in the \"true self\" is ultimately not some sort of desire for self-preservation, but actually a means to individual and communal renewal. The self is always connected to the social, and when the element of vocation is introduced, they come together in service. It is in the intertwining of personal awareness, spiritual formation, and community consciousness that one's life may speak the loudest and with greatest impact.\n\nParker Palmer's proclamation in Let Your Life Speak will help identify several critical elements needed for someone trying to define their Focused Life. The first of which is that of identity. A common question of self-reflection is to ask `who am I?' Palmer however contends that a better question to ask is `Whose am I?' While the first can resemble some narcissistic tendencies and inflation of ego, the latter recognizes the supremacy of God and His ownership in our lives. Since vocational callings come from within, we often find purpose out of the passions and gifts granted to us from the Creator. Secondly, Palmer differentiates the need for living out of authenticity rather than what others think ought to be. Addressing the pressures that are often placed on us by well-meaning outsiders, Palmer explains how these masks of expectation tend to be in conflict with the authentic self.\n\nFinally, anyone studying the concepts of a Focused Life will surely come across literature emphasizing the need to build upon strengths. While this practice is certainly true for someone to become highly productive, Palmer states that, \"life is not only about strengths and virtues; it is also about my liabilities and my limits, my trespasses and my shadow. An inevitable though often ignored dimension of the quest for `wholeness' is that we must embrace what we dislike or find shameful about ourselves as well as what we are confident and proud of\"(p. 6-7). This holistic approach to self-awareness will yield a deeper understanding of not only capabilities but also act as the criteria needed for decision making and weighing opportunities.\n\nThis book resonated with me on several levels. Parker Palmer is certainly a change agent for the Kingdom that has helped thousands of people find meaning in vocation. A surprisingly connecting topic was Palmer's honest contemplation of his battle with depression. While I have never experienced depression myself, I have had several friends and family members struggle through the despair depression brings. Palmer's two insights for handling depression, first to speak to its importance and second, the rejection of simple \"religious\" and \"scientific\" answers, will benefit any future counseling I do in this manner. In addition, Palmer's last chapter, \"There is a Season: From Language to Life\" combined the metaphors of life as a journey and seedbed, to the natural cycle of seasons. In discussing autumn, Palmer compares growth with the paradox of the hidden wholeness that accompanies death. In order for new life to begin, the old must first pass away. In terms of winter, Palmer writes that the cold and snowy season is gift, reminding us for the need of rest and dormancy in order to have a healthy life. The dialogue around humus and humility for vibrant life in spring was incredibly encouraging. Palmer writes that \"spring teaches me to look more careful for the green stems of possibility: for the intuitive hunch that may turn into larger insight\" (p. 104).\n\nStill yet, the section that struck me most in Let Your Life Speak, was chapter four \"Leading from Within\". Palmer essential states that leadership is example. Considering the interdependence in community, Palmer writes \"if it is true that we are made for community, then leadership is everyone's vocation, and it can be an evasion to insist that it is not\" (p. 74). In addition, Palmer promotes authentic leadership that comes from the heart as well as an understanding of spirituality along with technical abilities. In the final portion of the chapter on leadership and vocation, Palmer cautions about the five bestiary monsters to avoid or conquer by \"getting into\". It is these five monsters that wish to address in my personal integration of life and ministry. The first shadow-casting monster is that of insecurity. One of the biggest lies the Enemy attacks us with is the question of identity and by playing to our insecurities. The serpent tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden with a question of both. Therefore as mentioned already, the identity of a ministry leader and anyone living with a Focused Life must define their reality and personality in Jesus Christ. The second monster is that of a battleground. Instead of caving to the competitive nature of flawed humans, I seek to advance a cooperative, creative and collaborative style of leadership. Rather than competing with one another, my team members will complete each other. The third monster to slay is that of \"functional atheism\" or the false belief that ultimate responsibility rests with the leader. I was warned young in my ministry calling from a wise mentor that `if I take the blame for failures in ministry I may one day take credit for the success in ministry\". This of course is contrary to the servant model Jesus emphasized. Even the Son said he can do nothing apart from the Father and that he only does what he sees the Father doing (cf. John 5:19). The fourth monster is the fear of chaos. I feel that as an apostolically inclined ministry leader, I tend to be more entrepreneurial in nature and therefore more accepting of chaos. I know that for anyone or any organization to grow, change is required. This often assumes some sort of innovation and chaos. Finally, the fifth monster is the paradox in the denial of death. Again, as was covered in the discussion on fall and winter seasons, death is required for new life, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus.",
    "This is a delightful and insightful book. The warmth of the author's heart shines through his wise words. It was a revelation to me that our \"Way\" forward is revealed as much in the doors that close behind us as those that open in front of us. Like Dr Palmer, I have found that the doors that have shown me my own Way have always done so by closing behind me. The only issue for me is that the book isn't available as a regular book, but only as Used or on Kindle. I prefer my \"work books\" to be in paper rather than on screen. However, I give it 5 Stars anyway.",
    "This book seemed promising in the beginning, but ended up delivering little. Still, it contains some interesting points and take-aways.",
    "Bought this preloved product. As described although an older hardback version it is in good condition & much cheaper. Palmer shares honestly his deep reflections on how he has journied through His life searching for his vocation. Helpful to anyone wrestling with find a purpose & meaning to their life.",
    "Wonderful book with deep wisdom and insights into the spiritual life and vocation. I wish I had read this book years ago before my own discernment process as it integrates so many questions of identity, calling, gifts and listening to the Inner Teacher that would have helped me along the way. But now in my 40s I find it just as inspiring as I consider where and what I am being called to now. I like all of Parker Palmer's books and his blog but so far this is my favorite. Very good.",
    "I am profoundly grateful for the honesty and clarity with which Parker Palmer explores how to listen to your life."

    "I’m working on starting my business and this literally helped with everything from the process of business to marketing and sales. Negative reviews where weird I guess they wasted their money on an mba and when they saw this book they got mad because they wasted so much time and money lol. Get this book!",
    "\"You dropped 150 grand on an education you could have gotten for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.\" Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting\n\nIn The Personal MBA Josh Kaufman makes a very compelling case (as does Will Hunting) that for people considering an MBA, the economics aren't that great. For many graduate students (not just Business majors), it feels like a Casino: everyone takes the tests, and gets primed, then takes out a huge loan from the bank (often a six-figure amount) hoping that when they come out the other side, there will be an awesome, high-paying job waiting for them. It's a financial transaction, not really an educational one. In fact, much of the education gleaned from an Master in Business Administration is theoretical and marginally updated from the projects and Case Studies done in Bachelor of Business and Economics programs; after all, how can you possibly sit in a classroom and `learn' how to be a Manager, or an Executive? Of course you can't. But the schools are more than willing to let you try, as long as the cheques clear.\n\nProvided those cheques do clear (in many states in the US, the juice, as they say, is running the day you take your first class, not after you graduate), students can expect a marginally better income (in this economy? yuck) awaiting them on the other side; it turns out they're getting a crash course in finance after all! Ouch.\n\nIn the beginning of The Personal MBA, Kaufman reveals something striking: research shows there is little evidence that getting an MBA has any correlation with long term success in Business. Top tier Business programs make sure that they only accept brilliant students, which is why many go on to greatness. Business schools make it their business to take credit for other people's work-namely, your undergraduate degree, and your having studied for the GMAT. In a perfect world, you'd be better off, studying for the GMAT, applying to Harvard Business, getting accepted, and then refusing to attend (and pay the exorbitant tuition, and 2 years of your life), then bragging on your CV that you were accepted at Harvard, and applying for a plum job with a Fortune 500 company, ready to put you through the Management training program.\n\nWhy doesn't anybody do that? Because the MBA itself acts as a signal to help simplify the recruiter's job: he or she doesn't want to read 5,000 CVs. Reading 50 is a lot faster. It's that simple. Which 50 get the job doesn't really matter. When the eventual 20-something is hired, he or she will proceed to the actual training program, and begin to be molded into the perfect Hewlett Packard / Cisco/ Apple/ GE/ Nike/Starbucks Manager. That's right: real companies don't hire college grads and just plop them in a management or executive role. They have training programs. They have quarterly reviews. They promote you based on progress, not based on your GPA.\n\nWhere else did you think you would learn how to be a Manager?\n\nUnfortunately there's no way around it. Since MBA students are required to pass the GMAT first, a fundamental understanding of business and finance is required before you set foot on a real campus. If the Personal MBA (book, and accompanying website) is going to attempt to replace an actual MBA, they must put the reader through the paces of very fundamental Business Concepts.\n\nBusiness and Finance majors (like myself) will find much of this familiar, but that shouldn't take away from Kaufman's impressive achievement here. He's taken 2 years of Education and compressed it into a fantastic 400 page reference material. Kaufman will hold up the six-figure MBA and declare that by buying this book you're effectively saving $99,982, but of course, you're not getting a piece of paper either.\n\nSo for anyone who didn't graduate in Economics of Business,this book is a great summary of the definitions and concepts that took us about 4 years to get through. And it's pretty much the same material (minus countless case studies and Powerpoint presentations) you'd get from top-tier business programs.\n\nSo what do I suggest for young career-minded readers?\n\nThe point of an MBA, traditionally, was not for a 19 or 20 year old to `train' to be a manager (whatever that means) but for a middle-manager to train to be a leader in his current company. An ideal situation would be to get a job (any job) with a great company and work your way up, and eventually have your boss pay for your education. The company will consider the investment in human capital worth it if they see potential in you, and will also have you promise to stay with the company for at least a few years upon graduation, so they can benefit from their investment.\n\nEducation is great. If I didn't believe that, I sure wouldn't have started a blog about it. But so is avoiding foolish six-figure debt. Consult your boss, and consult this book before proceeding.\n\n(PS. Yes, I've graduated from a post-secondary International Business program. That one came with a five-figure student loan, not six.)\n\nMore reviews like this on 21tiger",
    "Of the many reviews I have written here, writing a review for this text was among the most difficult because \"The Personal MBA\" has a large target market consisting of a wide variety of potential readers, and the vast majority of reviews here are very positive. Because of this situation, I fall back on my review philosophy, which is to write as objectively as possible, taking into account the claims of the author in terms of their goals, as well as comparing to other materials in the marketplace. What is not necessarily fair is to write solely based on my knowledge or experience, which often times does not match the backgrounds of the target audience.\n\nAdmittedly, this text is very well written. The writing style and organization of Kaufman contributes greatly to readability, and I enjoyed this aspect of this book. Many business works have a lot of fluff, and in general most of this text provides substance that will be appreciated by many readers. In addition, the history behind this book is interesting in that it came about as a natural step after the author created a heavily visited blog listing books and resources he had found valuable in his studies, so readers can be assured that this text was not written from an ivory tower perspective but resulted directly from reader interest.\n\nThe author writes at length in his first chapter as to why this book should be read. It is not easy summarizing this chapter in a few short sentences, but Kaufman mentions that what he provides here is \"a set of foundational business concepts that you can use to get things done. Reading this book will give you a firm foundation of business knowledge you can use to make things happen. Once you master the fundamentals, you can accomplish even the most challenging business goals with surprising ease.\" Later, the author calls this text \"a self-directed crash course in business\", and provides an extensive discourse as to why the traditional MBA does not provide significant value.\n\nNeither the author nor myself has an MBA, although we have both gone to business school (and I also have a graduate degree). While I cannot speak for the author, in my opinion there is substantial material in this text to provide to the business neophyte. However, I was unfortunately not overly impressed with the material Kaufman provides after chapter 6, which is midway through the book. The author makes up on this aspect to some extent by providing an appendix entitled \"How to Continue Your Business Studies\" that lists dozens of texts in a variety of business topics, although this list serves as a reminder that, as communicated in the introduction, what the author provides here is an introductory text.\n\nIf you do not have time to read this whole text, I recommend reading chapter 2, entitled \"Value Creation\" on creating value for customers. The summary that the author provides on the \"Twelve Standard Forms of Value\" (product, service, shared resource, subscription, resale, lease, agency, audience aggregation, loan, option, insurance, capital), for example, is very well done. The \"Ten Ways to Evaluate a Market\" is also especially well done. The author obviously summarizes and synthesizes material from disparate sources very well, but the reader needs to be aware that much of the content provided is just that, a CliffsNotes-styled survey of what the author has determined is fundamental to studying business.\n\nFrom the perspective of a consultant, be aware however that this material is sometimes overly summarized and synthesized. For example, in his 3-chapter presentation on understanding systems, analyzing systems, and improving systems, many important topics are glossed over, and unless the reader understands the substance that is waiting for them within the reading lists the author provides, they may minimize the importance or complexity of the topics. For example, the definition that the author provides for \"Return on Investment (ROI)\" is limited to \"simply dividing the amount of money you collect by the amount of money you spent, then subtracting by 1.00.\"\n\nHowever, there would be no need for texts such as \"The Consultant's Scorecard: Tracking Results and Bottom-Line Impact of Consulting Projects\", by Jack Phillips (see my review), where several ROI calculations are detailed at length, if this calculation were so simple. Fortunately, Kaufman points the reader in the right direction, and presents in an entertaining manner, and so this book is recommended to anyone new to business topics, especially aspiring entrepreneurs. One of the best features of this text are the many quotes from other sources that introduce each of the subtopics in the 12 chapters provided here, and for this reason alone this book is worth a read.",
    "Succinct and full of extremely useful information. The best thing about it is that you get all the genuine meat without having to trawl through a lot of inane guff that you would have to do if you did a full MBA (I know because I dropped out of my MBA as there was far too much irrelevant material).",
    "As in the title, my first pick being this book is off to a great start. I loved how everything is sliced into sub-chapters making it so easy to understand. I've used the recommended business books from the book and Josh Kaufman as to what to go to next. So enjoying reading two hours a day ....",
    "The most important business book I have ever read. The insights on systems thinking has changed my life in the business world as well my personal life",
    "The book is the bibliography which is extensive enough to keep you busy for at least six months to a year of reading material.\nEverything included is purposeful, and while there isn't much of any depth, this is more like what you'd get from an actual MBA. A big picture view and the memory/awareness of what to consider and whether to look it up when the time comes around.\n\nThe title is somewhat misleading. You will not master the \"art\" of business, but it will surely get you started.\n\nThis book is a great overview of many business topics and will help you identify which topics you need to learn more about.",
    "Most of the praise for this book comes from people who say, \"Well, I don't know what I'm talking about, but…\". Is it possible to learn something from this book? Yes. Is it a well-written book? No. Is it well-researched? No. Does it prove contentious points, or even reason them through thoroughly? No. This book is the equivalent of meeting some old drunk in a bar, who says, to you: \"Getting an MBA is a scam, let me tell you something, boy…\""

    "4 stars",
    "Super quick read, couldn't get enough of the knowledge. I have so many notes taken from the book and already gave started living most of the stuff it taught",
    "In my opinion, if a personal finance book is going to really have quality knowledge I think its got to have the core principles. Pay yourself first, get out of debt, emergency fund, retirement, etc. These are all fundamental in wealth building and this book does a great job in each chapter of breaking it down in such a way that the common man or woman with their daily lifestyle can adapt to and incorporate. While like other books it does seem to get repetitive and I often think to myself, \"Oh great! Another Dave Ramsey or Robert Kiyosaki telling me the same thing blah blah blah\" this one stands out because the entire premise of the book is to make everything automatic. Direct deposit a portion of your pay to your retirement, set it up so that when you give up budgeting on the 3rd month or week because lets be honest we all do, you will still be saving money that is out of sight and out of mind. While portions of the book may be repeated knowledge to some, it is an eye opener for others, at 25 yrs old I am happy to be learning these lessons now as opposed to during the next recession. Growing up in an area where in 08' seemed like every kids parent's were losing their jobs (my parents as well) it really is a scary thought thinking back to that time. Fear is what it took me to start reading financial books and this one I will throw up there with the top of them, especially in the 21st century. Read this book, you will think a lot, you will be anxious but motivated, but most of all you will be educated, and you will thank yourself later.",
    "I liked how David placed activities within the chapters which allowed me to see where I was financially and what steps I needed to put in place!",
    "What I like about this book is the many tips as to how to manage your earnings and savings wisely. For instance, consolidating your credit card debt, investing in your 401k or similar plan, paying yourself first, etc. However, what I dislike is the notion of investing to enjoy your retirement. A true fact about getting older and needing to rely on a source of income but why having to wait then to enjoy life until then? What about a concept of getting financially independent in a few years to enjoy our lives in our thirties or forties? Why wait until our 60's?\n\nOverall it's been great to read this book and in sure I'll apply some of its principles.",
    "This is the first personal finance book I ever read. It gave me the basic financial roadmap for my life and gave me the motivation to get started asap. Highly recommend!",
    "Was really excited about this book. Started reading and it's just for Americans. There are good points made but there's constant mentions of the 401(k) plan, different US investment providers etc. The 'Now make it automatic' chapter is one of the most dullest book chapters that I've read in my entire life!!\nAll this and I've only just passed the half way mark of this book. I better go and return 'Start Late, Finish Rich'.",
    "Lots of useful information if you live in America, but most of the information was not relevant to the uk. Managed to take away a few tips. However, I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone living outside of America.",
    "I read this book in 2 sessions, as it was so easy to read and understand. The principles are worth following, and I have already implemented 3 \"automatic\" rules in order to simplify my finances. This is a case of \"why didn't I think of that - it was so easy\".",
    "It's a good book for beginners but not so much for people with solid money habits. Plus, it's not so useful for people in the UK, since the material is focused on US products.",
    "Every young adult should be given this for Christmas. It's the best gift you can give to a friend or family member. And it's never too late to start, for a little saved regularly means a little more fun later in life when you'll want to enjoy the last chapters of your life. David nows needs to update Start Late, Finish Rich."

The author kept the terminology simple & very easy to remember and take action. I recommended this book to my 20 yr old daughter in college. Had I had this information at 20 yrs old, I would have been much more savvy with my money earlier in life! I'm very thankful for this book which has totally inspired me to get and keep my finances in order! Thank You so much Jackie Koski!! You're a godsend! :))",
    "Like everyone else has said, it's a great book! Very readable. It is well suited to someone just starting out on their own. It has a lot of specific information about common things you have to do once you are on your own. However, even for us oldsters, there is a lot of reference material. There are many helpful URLs and phone numbers. Great index and appendix of websites by type too!",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! Great lessons to be learned, even by those of us who are <a-hem...> a bit older than recent grads! The chapters are concise, the writing flows so nicely, it's engaging and funny. Who knew money management could be so much fun? Ms. Koski has a gift and her daughter is surely a lucky young lady in so many respects!! Kudos to the author!! I will definitely be sharing this book with my own daugther as well as neices and nephews!!",
    "I liked the book overall; and think that it is an excellent book for individuals beginning their career and wanting to stay financially stable. Great sound advice for young people, as well as older adults. It's an excellent road map to follow and a great reference book dealing with life's necessities."

Good for newbies as well as those well versed in economics that want to pick up some additional examples, illustration, or just ideas on how to better communicate.",
    "This easy-to-read book is critical for anyone trying to understand common-sense economics. The author exposes many assumptions and fallacies that many of us probably don’t realize are problematic, and he backs up his case with real world examples. A terrific read."

    "This is a great way to learn Real Estate. It's from a company that makes textbooks for schools including colleges. Almost every card has an example as well. It wonderful that you can put the cards on a ring. read them then go on to more. Must start from the beginning. Glad I purchased this. Good investment.",
    "Let's go ahead and state the obvious - they aren't \"up-to-date\" cards, however, they're still worth buying! The content is really good and mostly still accurate, I think Barrons would do itself well to update them soon and im sure they will at some point. Most of the vocabulary and definitions are the same, they also keep the cards \"neutral\" and tell you to reference your states TREC website for more accurate answers. They've given you a general overview of national real estate laws and practices, if you want more specific details for YOUR particular state, reference your course work or get a book that's specific to where you are! Simple.\n\nThe cards themselves are very nice and laminated, they are but thinned out but my no means will they water if you bend them. Key ring comes taped in a nice little\nBox at then end and the cards themselves go up to 479 or 489 or something so it doesn't end evenly. If that's throwing you off, you have bugger problems that need to be addressed. For $15 (at the time I bought them) they are a great little buy and worth keeping around even after you passed your exams etc!\n\nAgain these cards are 5 years old and a lot of things have changed especially in 2020 but its up to you to keep up with those changes if you plan on being an agent, it's your fiduciary duty! :)",
    "These card are from 2015 information could definitely be updated as for as verbiage. I’m having a great time studying and most of the information is relevant to me it’s a very effective study method just wish it was more current",
    "If you are in real estate school these are a must have. They helped me pass my real estate test",
    "Not good for canadian real estate"

    "This book certainly has changed the way I look at listening, or rather, the way I listen to what I read and whom I listen to.\n\nFor me, it was very ear opening (instead of eye opening). I’ve learned a lot and now I need to really ponder over it all and apply.\n\nThere could be so much more to say about this book, but rather than hearing it from me, you can read it and get so much more out of it.\n\n*Note: regarding language use, it’s a pretty clean book. I honestly only remember one cuss word in the entire book. There might be 2 or 3, but I really only remember one and it was closer to the end of the book.",
    "Just buy it. Don’t even think twice about it. It’s a great addition to your personal growth arsenal. You won’t regret it.",
    "The author gets brutally honest at times and makes you stop and think about all of the failed connections you may have, and reasons for it. There were a number of areas where I could see myself making these mistakes (sometimes daily) and realizing how I suffered, and those around me suffered. There are great points made about how a lack of listening affects our day-to-day lives, and how technology may be the cause of cultural declines. If you can't manage to listen to what the author has written, and take moments to soul search the areas of your life, this might not be the book for you.",
    "I really loved reading this book, so clearly written and concise and so, so relevant in this noisy world where everyone is self absorbed. Practical and filled with heartwarming anectodes, it makes for a great summer read",
    "I had high hopes that this book would actually give me tactics for being a better listener, but it is just moralizing and fingerwagging. Bummer.",
    "This book’s most important lesson may be a collection of tenets you must believe to be an effective listener: (1) People are unpredictable — everyone you know or meet. (2) What you know is different from what they know. (3) There is more to the story than first appears. Kate Murphy then effectively exposes what you can *do* with those truths — how to commit to listening and its magical (though scientifically explained) ability to enrich you through learning and building close relationships. Read the book with a pen in hand — there’s no 1-pager cheat-sheet at the end.\n\nThat said, brace yourself for a certain preachiness that infuses every chapter. I wish that the book centralized all the critiques of the modern world (social media, addictive phones, political climate, etc.), so that the other chapters could more purely focus on the intersection of listening and *timeless* characteristics of the human experience (distractability, building of intimacy, a beautiful question, etc.). Instead, you’ll have to muscle through the sense that the author keeps touching on those critiques since she thinks you JUST DO NOT GET IT YET.\n\nI also think there’s an important topic the author missed, or only brushes against: How to engender an environment where you will be listened to. It’s true that listening itself will have this impact — a great way for a person to say with genuine curiosity, “How was your day?”, is to first have that very conversation about *their* day. But you can’t rely on others to bring the same focus and intent to conversations as you will after reading this book. Is there any evidence out in the world of how to help someone *else* shift into “listener” mode? After all, the author makes the case that the best conversations — and even business or academic partnerships — involve *all* participants being listeners.\n\nThat said, this is an important work. I’ve looked for accessible best practices for listening, and this is the first I’ve found, and it’s new. I celebrate and thank Kate Murphy for her inspiration and her legwork to give me a framework and tactics to become a better human.",
    "You're Not Listening is a book I originally bought in its audio format. On its original play, I was convinced I would have to listen to the book again. On the second listen, I was convinced I had to buy the book.\n\nKate Murphy wrote a really good--short--book that will teach all of its readers so much about what we gain from listening--or not.\n\nMurphy manages this by using her role as a journalist and the many conversations she's had (listened to) with a variety of people that range from a priest in San Juan, Texas to a multitude of Ivy college figures on the subject of listening.\n\n*Readers be warn: the book touches on the importance of listening, though does not necessarily tell you how to become a great listener. While this book is really good, you can probably knock it down in a day or two (I originally was surprised when I saw the hardcover after listening to the audio two times, I was expecting a larger book).\n\nAdditional grievance: sometimes it feels like Murphy is trying too hard to picture the simple conversations with the people in her book because the start and endings read like the beginning and conclusions of magazine articles.",
    "A very well written, clear and thorough account of how good listening has taken a back seat in our society. While it's not the only culprit, technology plays a huge role and the author brings this up repeatedly throughout the book. I found myself taking lots of notes in order to practice and improve this important skill!",
    "I am looking forward to reading this but want to make the author and publisher aware that this U.K. printing has been badly messed up by the printer. Dust jacket is misprinted/misaligned and the interior cover is upside-down relative to the content. This is a real shame, it’s a mess.",
    "This is a simple book with an obvious and important point. It is especially useful for people who have brilliant minds but do not know that their own brains are accelerating faster than their companions' speech, and thus, get themselves distracted by their own thoughts and stopped listening to their friends. If they are professionals, this is something they should overcome because listening well will make them better professionals. Michael Caine once said to his director that his part in one scene just required him to stand around doing nothing. His director corrected him. He said, ''You're not doing nothing. When you're doing nothing, you are watching, and listening, and thinking'.",
    "I have got a lot out of reading this book. I’ve talked about it to friends and it had made me much more aware of my thought processes and tendency to cap stories.\n\nMy only reservation is that it seemed to run out of steam, got a bit repetitive and then ended abruptly to make way for pages and pages of footnotes.",
    "Great book enjoyed reading it & made you aware that hearing is not the same as listening.\nHearing is passive. Listening is active.",
    "This is a good book if you are interested in human behaviour and the act of listening\nI would recommend it to anyone who feels like they are either not being listened to, or you’re prone to not listening properly"

Because the abnormality was lying underneath, in the foundation of the iceberg, everybody went about their day not knowing something tragic was getting ready to happen. All changes aren't bad, some changes are great and pushes us closer to our destiny. We can lose a lot just because we don't want to accept change, which will come whether we want it or not!",
    "Excellent book for facing change:\nI work as a psychiatrist with persons with intellectual developmental disorder(IDD) (earlier called mental handicap) and their families. The chief challenge of my work is to bring a positive approach to training efforts by the parents. As parents with a ‘special child’ parents face many challenges in bringing up and in planning for the child’s future. This responsibility is not what parents wanted, when the child was born into their family. The needs of ‘special child’ requires parents to think completely differently about a number of areas like day to day care, training the child, schooling, health care, planning for the future etc. It is these challenges that require you to take up the challenges and find new ways of succeed.\nThe central theme of my work, is to EMPOWER YOUR CHILD AND YOUR FAMILY TO FACE THE CHALLENGES.\nIt is in this context, that the book ‘Our iceberg is melting’ has a special meaning to you and your family.\nMost parents pass through life denying the ‘special’ needs of your child. From the book, parents learn to accept the situation, by accepting your child’s ‘special’ needs that they can be of greatest help to him/her.\nThe book introduces the 8 principles of problem solving, which is useful to parents in a slightly modified form, as below.\n1. Recognise the special needs of your child and importance of training\n2. Pull together all members of your family\n3. Develop a vision for your child and a Strategy\n4. Reach out professionals for help and support\n5. Acquire skills to train your child\n6. Plan for Short-term gains\n7. Don't give up\n8. Make effort continuous and regular.",
    "I have not read the book yet, but it looks interesting!",
    "The book is for all parties involved in a cultural change. A quick read. I could identify with almost each character when thinking about the change my company went through.",
    "This book illustrates very cleverly the ways in which organisations should respond to necessary change. I read it a long time ago and wanted a new copy. I've lost count of the No-No penguins I've encountered; the anti- change types who try to put everyone off because they feel threatened, but the book shows how the team can succeed by working together and using their respective strengths effectively. A great book - if you're introducing a change, buy it for everyone in the company and ask them to read it before you start- that way your team will know why it's important to work with it and won't be so scared.",
    "Written like a fable, but it really gets to the root of the difficulties of changing institutional 'traditional' practice. The characters will remind you of people you work with for sure! How to bring them on board and willing to change is the crux of the book. Lovely to read and definitely not heavy duty, but very thought provoking just the same.",
    "Putting change management insights into a fable format is a stroke of genius. As human beings we have a mind for stories. We learn and remember stories more quickly and easily than facts and figures. The steps of change outlined in the book will now stay with me in a way that they fundamentally would not have done if I had simply read the list of steps a few times.\n\nI would thoroughly recommend this book to all, even those not considering business management!",
    "This is a book to turn the hearts of the reluctant, those who can't see the need to change. But don't get it for them, get it for your team.\nIf you share this cute penguin fable with you team, you will enable conversations which can flow into the kinds of change management projects which will work both for the team and your whole organisation. Amongst other things, I learnt new ideas for getting on message despite differences in the team, and thus being better able to win over those you need to persuade to change. It isn't a book heavy in change management theory. It's not a 'how-to'. It simply describes a generalised eight step process to change - you must identify how each of the steps works out in your situation. That's why it's a book to share, discuss over a beer, and brainstorm your way out of stagnation to something more productive.",
    "Enjoyed the book and the pictures. Took a few hours and the leadership messages come through. Enjoyable ready and thought provoking if you are embarking on change of team / location or ways of working."

    "Mr. Maxwell is a very readable and personable author. His style is rich in well chosen quotes, however, the quotes I found that were the real gold nuggets were his own. It was not laid out in the manner I expected where the rules would form something of a outline and then broken down in detail. Instead the rules got lost in the weeds of detail. But if you press on and read to the conclusion, you'll find this book more of an inspiring journey.",
    "Loved it",
    "I have read many of John Maxwell's books on leadership and personal development. His writings have impacted my life in a big way, and this book is no exception. I think this is the best book he has written.\n\nIf you really want to grow spiritually and as a leader, you will benefit greatly from this book.\n\nIn Chapter 1, Maxwell deals with the law of intentionality - growth doesn't just happen. Some people don't realize they have to pursue growth, they may not realize how to grow, or they may be waiting for some big event in their life to propel them and inspire them to begin to grow. Some people are afraid to grow.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Maxwell covers the law of awareness - you need to know yourself before you grow yourself. You need to know where you want to be before you can get there. This chapter deals with finding your passion and purpose for life. God created all of us for a purpose.\n\nIn Chapter 3, Maxwell writes about the law of mirror. We have to see ourselves properly before we can grow. This chapter tells us how to develop a healthy image of ourselves. As a Christian, I believe this comes from realizing how God views me. Practical tips such as learning to defeat negative thoughts about yourself, comparing yourself to others, and living to add value to others are discussed.\n\nIn Chapter 4, Maxwell deals with the law of reflection. We have to discipline ourselves to reflect on where we are and what we are doing in order to grow. This chapter deals with the importance of being a good thinker.\n\nChapter 5 is about the law of consistency. This chapter is about disciplining yourself to follow a routine and being determined not to quit.\n\nChapter 6 is about the law of environment. Growth thrives in the right surroundings. Change depends on our choices. We must choose to surround ourselves with the right people to grow.\n\nChapter 7 is about the law of design. Maxwell talks about developing strategies to induce growth. Here, he talks about systems to put in place to make growth happen.\n\nChapter 8 is about the law of pain. This is maybe the best chapter in the book. As we learn to manage bad experiences right, growth happens. Our greatest gains come from our deepest pains. Don't feel sorry for yourself - embrace problems and see them as an opportunity to grow. A bend in the road is not the end of the road!\n\nChapter 9 is about the law of the ladder. As we climb the ladder of personal character, growth takes place. Most leadership failures are character failures. Instead of focusing on competence, we should focus on character. Instead of worrying so much about how good we look on the outside, we should concentrate on looking good on the inside. The application part of this chapter is very helpful as Maxwell has us compare the amount of time we have spent in the last year on making the outside look good compared to making the inside look good.\n\nChapter 10 is about the law of the rubber band. You cannot grow unless you are stretched. Comfort is the enemy of growth and we must be willing to step out of our comfort zones. Don't be satisfied with being average. Embrace change and don't be afraid of it.\n\nChapter 11 is about the law of the trade off. You have to give some things up to grow up. Give up instant gratification for personal growth. Give up security for significance.\n\nChapter 12 is about the law of curiosity. We grow by asking questions. We must learn to cultivate curiosity. If you know all the answers, you're not asking the right questions. Every day we should seek to learn something new. He has us to rethink the phrase, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" This can be a dangerous philosophy to personal growth. We must be willing to think outside the box.\n\nChapter 13 is about the law of modeling. We grow as we follow the example of good models. Seek out a personal mentor to help you grow.\n\nChapter 14 is about the law of expansion. There is no finish line to growth - we never stop.\n\nChapter 15 is about the law of contribution. As we grow, we are enabled to help others grow. We should think of ourselves as rivers, not reservoirs. We shouldn't just always take in - we ought to be giving out. This is a very helpful and practical chapter.\n\nGet this book and read it! You will benefit greatly.",

    "Right my family member said that the author delivers in this book in a powerful manner and they have implemented\nsome of the things they read in the book in their own life and will continue to do so for the future. I will say when I asked them if they were enjoying the book the words they used were OMG it is a fantastic read..... for that reason I will be making a purchase myself next week so I will let you know my view, got some growths of my own that I need to get on with.",
    "I've only just finished this book but I already know I'm going to be reading it again. John Maxwell is one of my favourite teachers. The guidelines he provides on the laws surrounding personal growth are indeed invaluable - everything from being intentional about your personal growth to using it to make a meaningful contribution to the world. As with everything John does, this book is down to earth, practical and an excellent resource if you want more from yourself and from life.",
    "Well written.",
    "It's a great book indeed, as you read it you can see that the author as a lot of experience...Moreover this book as a lot of concepts from other self books so it's very condensed you don't need too many self helps books get this one and reflect on the concepts...",
    "Have read many of john Maxwells books the most noteable one being 21 laws of leadership,all of his books are easy to read and need to be put into practice to reap the full benifits from them.\nHave only just started into the first three laws and believe the long terms benefits will be ongoing and rewarding.\nThis book would not be for those who are not willing to put something into it,as with all things we rarely get something for nothing,no quick fixes."

    "“Setting aside just 15 minutes a day will enable you to read up to two dozen books in a year. Keep it up and you will have read 1,000 books in your lifetime. That’s the equivalent of going through college five times.” I found this motivating quotation in “Books Are Tremendous” by Charlie “Tremendous” Jones.\n\nBut…here’s a crazy idea (whether you’re back at the office or still in your bunker): every Monday morning, before you look at your email—invest 15 minutes in reading.\n\nOption #1: I’m not asking you to do this every day—just every Monday. So here is a “Thank God It’s Monday” book with 52 mini-chapters.\n\nOption #2: Or, delegate your reading and ask team members (on a rotation basis) to give a five-minute chapter summary of this book at your weekly staff meeting.\n\nDon’t allow the mini-chapters (four pages or less each) to delude you into thinking this is light-weight content. The 52 short chapters are readable, to-the-point, and packed with promise for thoughtful implementers.\n\nStarting next Monday, what if…you invested 15 minutes to read and think about Chapter 1, “What Exactly Should CEOs and CHROs Change?” Even if you’re not the CEO or the Chief HR Officer, you will learn (and remember) the six changes recommended by Gallup, including #3, “Millennials and Generation Z don’t want bosses—they want coaches.” Sneak peek: it’s time to retire the old-style boss who leads by command and control.\n\nWith your 15-minutes-every-Monday discipline, look at what awaits you for the next 52 weeks:\n2) Why Organizational Change Is So Hard\n3) Two Non-Negotiable Traits for Leaders\n10) Hiring Star Employees\n21) The Five Coaching Conversations\n25) Make “My Development” the Reason Employees Stay\n30) The Five Traits of Great Managers\n47) Gig Work: The New Employer-Employee Relationship\n\nBased on roundtable interviews with CHROs from 300 of the world’s largest organizations, the content covers Strategy, Culture, Employment Brand, Boss to Coach, and the Future of Work.\n\nThe robust appendix (pages 189-378) includes major sections on: “Leading With Your Strengths: A Guide to the 34 Clifton Strengths Themes,” (including one unique code to take the online assessment), “Q12: The 12 Elements of Great Management,” and “The Relationship Between Engagement at Work and Organizational Outcomes,” plus more.\n\n“The Future of Work” section, Chapters 32 to 41, addresses diversity and inclusion topics—and the critical “lever” of the manager, a discussion of the gender gap, women in the workplace (work-life flexibility, etc.) and for us old guys, “Are Boomers a Burden?” Breaking News: “74% of Americans plan to work past age 65.”\n\nYou have my permission to start with Chapter 26, “Moneyball for Workplaces: 12 Elements of Team Success.” Here are three:\n• I know what is expected of me at work.\n• In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.\n• There is someone at work who encourages my development.\n\nWhy this book? Gallup’s extensive research (extensive!) has concluded this:\n\n“Of all the codes Gallup has been asked to crack dating back 80 years to our founder, George Gallup, the single most profound, distinct and clarifying finding—ever—is probably this one: 70% of the variance in team engagement is determined solely by the manager.”\n\nThey add, “Usually, there isn’t a single lever to create change. In this case, there is: It’s the manager.”",
    "had to read for work, good book",
    "I am giving this book four stars because it was not what I expected from the description and the writing style was choppy.\n\nPros:\nEasy to read, short uncomplicated ‘chapters’ (when looking them independently)\nComes with code for Clifton Strengths Assessment (which can be up to $50 to take online or via the Gallup app)\n\nCons:\nSome “chapters” aren’t even one page long- for me personally the information felt disjointed and had to follow in an actionable way\nSecond part of the book is devoted to understanding Clifton Strenghts results so if you’ve done this work already or read their comparable books this is all repeat\n\nNot a ‘must have’ for my library, but interesting insight. If you read /research less on the topics discussed you might find this more interesting or valuable.",
    "It’s the Manager should have been a revolutionary book that finally recognizes the realities of work and employee engagement. While its good to have a friend at work, its better to be working for a person and team that cares about you, encourages you and raises your overall performance. After years of treating managers as a figure in an XL spreadsheet — cutting their numbers, re-engineering their authority away and currently planning to strip away their brains with AI, the truth comes out. People work for people and work better when they work with better people — starting with their manager aka immediate supervisor.\n\nThis premise which should help lead a change in the way we think about people and teams in the post digital world, deserves a cleaner, more compelling and clearer explaination that this book. It’s the Manager is a compendium of mini-blog posts that ramble more than 600 pages covering 52 insights developed from the latest Gallup Survey.\n\nSkip this book, its too fragmented to do more than give you factoid-stories that do not move an organization forward. Read the reviews and resulting articles instead, share those with your manager as that is what we all need.\n\nThe authors had a tremendous opportunity to define work in the AI, Machine Learning Automation world and blew it big time.\nNot recommended",
    "Today all companies must adapt and grow; and for this there is nothing better than doing it from the development and growth of its own employees. In this sense, the authors say it best with the following sentence: “If you give every team member in your company a great manager -a great coach- one who cares about their development and growth, you have successfully engineered an organization with unlimited potential.”",
    "Solid research here. I wish more leaders would read this book.",
    "Our organization recently switched to Gallup for our employee opinion survey. This book was very helpful in finding solutions for those problems, and for being the best manager I can be. I’ve been lending it around the office, too! It’s a very easy read, too.",
    "Manager development is a skill so frequently missed by firms who complain about turnover. This book provided clear, actionable ideas to improve performance and culture.",
    "I bought this book because I needed practical knowledge on staff engagement, tips that I can put to use immediately after putting the book down. I always believed staff engagement starts from the first day of onboarding. This book did not disappoint. I also like the fact that the book is designed in such a way that you can look at the table of contents, find the problem you are facing or topic you are interested in, then jump right in instead of reading cover to cover.",
    "A must read book for every manager!\nIt’s totally actionable! Makes me rethink and redesign my everyday activities, definitely worth it !!",
    "La investigación está bien por el hecho de inducar el grado de interes de los jovenes por el trabajo",
    "Es exactamente lo que buscaba",
    "Excelente lectura para Identificar tus fortalezas como manager y como potencializarlas"

    "So many books have been written about the \"art of conversation,\" or \"small talk,\" and so many people feel almost completely inadequate about the whole notion of trying to make conversation, that I felt compelled to offer my take on the subject.\nI have never had a problem talking to people - in fact, I have always heard, all my life, that I am very outgoing and friendly.\nBut I have also felt completely stymied, on occasion - especially when meeting someone new - with not being able to think of anything to say, and it becomes very uncomfortable to be in that situation. That this could ever happen to someone who virtually never has any problem with talking to people was puzzling, to say the least.\nOur immediate reaction whenever this happens is to think that we, ourselves, have some sort of problem. We invariably equate our not being able to think of something to say with being shy.\nBut I have discovered that this is actually a reaction to what another person has said, or more to the point, has not said, rather than an inherent condition.\nOne particular incident was so troubling to me, I attempted to analyze exactly what happened, and figure out what may have caused it.\nBut it was very instructive to me when that happened. I learned from that episode that actions from one person trigger counter-actions from another, and they are an automatic reaction.\nThis was a classic case of cause-and-effect, and I will never forget the impact this episode had on me.\nIt taught me something that I had never had occasion to even think about before.\nBeing at a loss for words is something that many people have experienced at one time or another. However, I am here to tell you: Cheer up! It's almost surely not your fault, at all!\nOne thing to always keep in mind: Conversation is a two-way street. It is not possible to talk to yourself.\nWell, it actually is, but you will definitely get some strange looks if you do.\nBut the point is that it takes two... just like the song says, \"It Takes Two To Tango.\"\nHowever, there is another angle to the problem of having conversation with someone you don't know, which is completely out of our hands:\nThere is a very serious mental health issue which afflicts over 17 million American adults, called \"Social Anxiety,\" or \"Social Phobia.\"\nWe encounter the victims of this insidious condition all the time, but do not realize it when it happens. It's something most people have never even heard of, and know absolutely nothing about.\nThis condition renders its victims unable to conduct what we would regard as \"normal\" conversation, in that they can't express themselves fluently, and can only speak in short sentences of just a few words. But they otherwise outwardly appear to be perfectly normal.\nThe problem arises when we attempt to interact with them, inasmuch as we have no idea that we're trying to talk to someone who almost literally can't speak. Their distress is usually pretty apparent right away. Instead of an immediate response, you often receive a lengthy pause, followed by an answer of, at most, three or four words. And that answer will frequently consist of yes, no, or I don't know, but never with a descriptive sentence.\nBut having asked them a question, we can't just abruptly turn and walk away - although we both would be much better off to do exactly that. It becomes extremely awkward, because the more questions you ask, in an effort to try to communicate with them, the less able they are to answer you.\nThere is no way to predict when you will run into someone with this condition, and in fact, they seem to gravitate to places that one would expect them to avoid - where people are gathered to mix and mingle, and who certainly expect to be able to talk to each other.\nIt's only when we make an attempt to engage someone with this condition in actual conversation that we discover that there is a problem.\nSometimes, when attempting to talk to someone we may have just met, we find that we can't think of anything to say. Very often, this has nothing whatsoever to do with your inability to think of something interesting to say, but has everything to do with the fact that you are trying to talk to a person who cannot, or will not talk.\nThis occurs more frequently than we could even imagine.\nUsually, it happens after we have made an opening comment to someone we don't already know, to which they respond with stone silence. And we're not even sure exactly what we said.\nWhen we speak to someone, to be met with silence is such a rude, insulting act, that it assaults the senses, and makes it impossible to think of anything appropriate to say.\nThe game of verbal interaction out in public has rules, even though they are silent, and not chiseled in stone. It's something that people just automatically expect other people to understand, and play by.\nOf course, this only has to happen once, and you feel totally rejected.\nWe just naturally assume that they have heard us, and are deliberately ignoring us, for whatever reason.\nIt is so surprising, and so unexpected, you immediately become convinced that you have just \"laid an egg,\" or said something that they have deemed offensive, and so you clamp your mouth shut, and think of yourself as being incurably shy.\nExcept you're not shy at all. You'd know it for sure, if you really were.\nIf you have no trouble talking to friends or family, you probably don't have a problem at all, even though you might think you do.\nYou think the problem is that you are unable to talk to strangers, and this, to you, is proof positive.\nIn hindsight, what is so amazing about this whole scenario is that we just automatically assume that we are the problem; that we somehow are at fault, and not once do we even consider that the real cause of the problem is that the person we are attempting to converse with is not capable of communicating.\nEspecially if they appear to be someone of some substantial standing in the group - which happens much more frequently than you might ever suspect.\nIt just doesn't seem reasonable that someone who appears to cast a commanding presence, and gives the impression that they are someone to definitely be contended with, could possibly have any sort of problem with talking.\nBut you might be very much surprised.\nSometimes, we will ask a question of someone, and they do not respond, but instead, seem to look very condescendingly at us, and we feel intimidated. We interpret this as a superior attitude, and we feel knocked down in importance, and reduced in stature, at least inwardly.\nBut what is actually happening is that this person is not capable of coming up with any sort of answer to our question or remark. They don't respond, because they can't.\nIt is very possible that the glaring look they send our way is pure anger, that we have unwittingly exposed their Achilles heel. Just by asking them a question, we put them on the spot to answer, and they are unable to do so.\nIf you were afflicted with Social Anxiety, you definitely would know it. You would not be asking anybody any questions, about anything, and you certainly would not be buying books that professed to cure your \"shyness\" out in the public arena.\nBut there has to be a reason that this happened to you at this particular time and place... and there is.\nYou have encountered someone who does have Social Anxiety, and have asked them a question.\nThink about it: Usually, when we experience what we think of as an \"awkward silence,\" it is right after we have said something to someone we don't know, and they do not immediately respond. A strange silence hovers in the air, and we feel as though we could sink into our shoes.\nWe feel sure we have said something terrible, even though we have no idea what it might have been - but the cold silence we are receiving is devastating.\nIn the space of just a few seconds, a \"cat and mouse\" game is being played out. Normally, the person asking the question controls the direction of the conversation. But just as soon as the person being asked the question responds with silence, that control is wrenched away from the person asking the question, and he is put on the defensive.\nThis is the moment when the control shifts from the one asking the question, to the person who is expected to respond, but does not. The questioner almost always automatically assumes that they are at fault, and feels extremely vulnerable.\nBut the important thing to keep in mind is that you asked a question, but did not receive an answer, and why do you suppose that happened?\nIf you examine what has just transpired, it is that you have said something that normally would have elicited a response. You expected a response, and yet no response has been forthcoming - only dead silence.\nThis is completely unexpected, and catches you totally flat-footed!\nBut this didn't happen because you said something that was embarrassing, or out of line.\nThis happened because the person you were addressing was not capable of responding to your question or comment.\nDon't you get it? You spoke to him, expecting a reply, but you might as well have been speaking a foreign language, because all you got from him was a hard glare, and total silence.\nHe can't function. He can't respond to your comment or question, no matter what it is.\nHe's not being rude - although that's the impression you get - he just can't do any better.\nTo answer your comment or question would have required him to have come up with a stream-of-consciousness reply, explaining his opinion and the reasoning behind his answers, but his mental condition will not permit him to do so.\nAnd so he says nothing. Hence, the \"awkward silence.\"\nAnd you are left \"twisting in the wind,\" or hung out to dry, feeling as though you have dropped the ball, and blown a social encounter, and failed to keep the conversation going. And it's all your fault.\nBut it's not your fault at all. In fact, you are the true victim here.\nActually, though, you are not really a victim, since you do not have a mental issue. You are merely the unfortunate recipient of circumstance.\nThe biggest and most important lesson to learn from all of this is simply to not be shocked or surprised. Even though most of us definitely are surprised when this sort of thing happens, the main thing is just to be aware that this condition definitely does exist in the world, and we could very well find ourselves confronted with this scenario again, at some point in the future, and to not let it confound us, and make us doubt ourselves.\nWe feel a sense of personal responsibility whenever the dreaded \"awkward silence\" occurs, but it is not our fault, at all. When you receive silence as a response to a question or comment you make, it is not possible to salvage any sensible outcome from the exchange, because an exchange never actually happened in the first place.\nAny comment or question deserves a response, and lacking that response, there is actually nothing to say, except to frankly, walk away.\nBut realizing that we are not at fault is the first requirement in calming our fears about being inadequate in socializing with others.\nThe point is that the problems that other people have are also projected onto us, insofar as we are continually interacting with other people every day, and have to suffer through whatever might ensue, once we are locked into an attempt to converse with them.\nIn other words, what you see is not always what you get. We meet someone who seems to be perfectly normal, but once we start trying to communicate with them, discover that they are virtually totally incapable of carrying on a conversation.\nHow desperately sad!\nEven though anyone suffering from this condition certainly deserves compassion, once we realize that this is the case, it is futile to continue to attempt to have any sort of meaningful conversation, as confusing as that is to realize.\nAnd so, nothing has been resolved; the whole conversation is just left hanging, with no closure, but you are obviously at the end of the encounter, and you are left to just sort of saunter away, in some other direction.\nThis is actually separate and apart from the very real problem that many people have about making small talk at social gatherings. It is not easy, for many people. Much of it is due to a lack of self-confidence, which can't be easily cured with a few well-practiced sentences, or lines from a book.\nBut that lack of confidence is only exacerbated when we, in all innocence and sincerity, approach someone and ask them a question, only to be met with a wall of silence. This serves to shatter any feelings of competence we might have in being out in the great social wilderness, but it happens all the time, and contributes in no small part to the feelings we may have about being shy when meeting new people.\nIf we can understand that the problem is not because of any shyness we may have, but actually because of the inability of the person we are attempting to converse with to respond, our fears will disappear.\nConfidence only comes with experience. Sometimes, being out in the social jungle is like a soldier negotiating a mine field: There is disaster almost anywhere you step.\nBut even beyond the normal travails that present themselves at social gatherings, in trying to mix and mingle, we find that very often we are attempting to have a conversation, and trying to put our most charming foot forward, with someone who has no ability to reciprocate.\nMeaning that they can't speak, almost at all, beyond a three or four word sentence.\nAnd even that won't necessarily relate to whatever you may have just said.\nThe net result of this is that we come away confused, and at a complete loss to understand, and think of it as somehow being all our own fault.\nWhat is so devastating to our ego is that we interpret their actions as rejection. But it is actually an inability on their part to formulate any sort of response, due to an unfortunate mental block.\nThe point is that in meeting this totally unexpected silence in attempting to have a conversation with someone, is not in any way an indication that you have any sort of \"shyness\" problem, but only indicates that you are attempting to converse with someone who is not able to reciprocate.\nThis invariably comes as a total surprise, and leaves us momentarily stunned, and unable to think of anything to say.\nWhat it all boils down to is that we can very easily be blind-sided into assuming that someone who appears to be completely normal actually is normal, and capable of interacting normally in social events.\nBut we often find that the book's cover does not accurately reflect the book's content.\nSlowly, comes the dawn: We finally begin to realize that we actually don't have any problem at all in talking to other people, but that there are people who we attempt to talk to who simply can't reciprocate, and it's not our fault at all.\nIf someone can't as much as answer your question, we really don't have anything to respond to, do we?\nTo actually witness something as profoundly troubling as this is, and to realize that this person has no chance whatsoever, to simply experience the joy of having one-on-one conversation, such as most of us take for granted every day of our life, is tragic. They are relegated to virtual silence - although they may very well be able to talk with their own family or with friends, who are aware of their condition.\nJust to satisfy your own mind, and to prove to yourself that everything I have just said is true, all you need to do is make a few additional attempts to converse with this person, and you will invariably receive the same evasive response. Maybe not immediately, but if it's someone you are apt to come in contact with again in the future, you will have an opportunity to test it out.\nBut this time you won't be caught so completely unprepared.\nIt can't be stated emphatically enough that your own mental health is precious, and needs to be safeguarded at all times, to the best of your ability.\nIt is very difficult to imagine the harm to our psyche that can be caused by a seemingly innocent social contact.\nThe big thing to remember is that all of this disruption was created, almost always, by one individual. If we can get over the idea that we have some sort of problem, and realize that one person caused all the confusion, and that we have virtually no trouble getting along with the vast majority of other people we come in contact with, we will feel very comfortable in our own skin, and have perfectly good relationships with almost everybody we meet.\nBut what is so astonishing about this is that they often seem for all the world to be a completely normal person, sometimes even appearing to be someone with above-average intelligence.\nThis can only serve to further complicate our sometimes already shaky faith in our own social abilities, which is extremely unfortunate, since it is all so unnecessary.\nDid you ever stop to think of just what the difference is between talking to people you know, versus someone you've just met? With your friends, you know what to expect. You know that they are capable of communicating, and will answer your questions easily. But a stranger is an unknown quantity: You have no assurance that they will respond appropriately to anything you say. And in fact, when they do not respond to an overture you may have made, you feel that you must have said something wrong, or they would have responded in the way you expected.\nWhat you don't realize is that they are not able to respond appropriately. In fact, they can't respond at all.\nBy contrast, if someone is \"easy to talk to,\" even though we may have just met them, they seem as comfortable as an old friend.\nAnd so, we attach all the wrong reasons to things that happen, and tend to blame ourselves.\nPerhaps the most important lesson to be learned about getting along in public conversation, and even with people you think you know, is that looks can be very deceiving. Somebody may look for all the world to be just a regular, average Joe or Jane, but until you determine that they can actually carry on a conversation, you simply do not know for sure.\nBut it is relatively easy to find out: Just asking a few tentative questions, to see how they respond, and whether they can actually even converse at all, is all it takes. If they seem voluble and glib, at least you know they can speak.\nIt doesn't even matter what the question is about: You're just looking to see how much they are able to talk.\nYou don't have to mentally prepare any dialog in your head; just any thought that comes to mind will suffice. Most conversations start out with the most mundane of comments, and build from there, if there is in fact any conversation to be made from it.\nBut you must be prepared to discover that you might not get any sort of answer that makes any sense, and that is the purpose of asking the question in the first place.\nActually, every conversation boils down to simply asking a question, and answering a question.\nIt's not rocket science. People have been doing it for thousands of years. If you can't ask someone a question, and be able to count on them answering your question to your satisfaction, then there is definitely a problem, but the problem is not with you.\nOne word of caution: If you should happen to find yourself involved in a social organization where you encounter frequent and multiple examples of what I have just described, you must realize that you are outnumbered, and you are in jeopardy of harm to your own sanity.\nThis is not an exaggeration. Whether you remain involved is your decision, but I can tell you, it's not worth it.",
    "I outlined it and have used it in many settings. I like her personal account of struggling with shyness and a lack of desire to do small talk. I bought a copy for my sons! One of them has really grown in this area and asked great questions...in part due to this book.",
    "This book demystifies small talk by making it a practical skill that can be practiced, startling with the people you already see regularly.",
    "Lots of good advice for someone like me who considers themselves an introvert. Will definitely be having to reread and reference to hone those skills.",
    "It is a well-written book, but the contents are highly repetitive and redundant. The contents in the book can be covered in 8-page double-column magazine pages or a 1-hour TED talk. Instead, the author wrote 200 pages on small talk technics for communication.\n\nAs an engineering nerd, I am pretty bad at small talks and communication skills. So, I have learned lots of knowledge from this book. However, a more concise and consistent version of the book would be enough.\n\nAt last, no references are added to the book, making the book less convincing. The author has mentioned lots of personal antidotes, but the \"I have a friend...\" phrase is neither impressive nor vivid at all. The author also introduces lots of gazes, expressions, postures, and other psychological hacks without introducing the source, which is a steal (slight plagiarism) for me.",
    "I heard the author interviewed on the \"Teach the Geek\" podcast and she was impressive in relating her career pivot from engineer to conversational skills coach. This book sounded like a foundational tool in her seminars and was modestly priced for Kindle, so I got it. It's a quick read and gets the points across, so I can see it working well as a literal takeaway from her course. If you don't quail at the thought of small talk, then this is probably a three star book. If you feel defeated interacting with people and like some structure or plan in dealing with such situations, then this book is probably worthwhile for you. I enjoy chatting, but also enjoyed the book, so four stars from me.",
    "I would put this book in the category of \"professional self help\". Because of my desire to further my career, I have strayed away from the enjoyment of fiction and my David Baldacci obsession to this genre. I received this book on Saturday, 5/27/18, and finished it within two days. It is a very short read, around ~200 pages, large print, small pages, and has several comic-style strips, and long lists taking up space, making it a quick read (~3 hours).\n\nAs far as content goes, the book actually does deliver. It has some very detailed advice regarding speaking to people from starting a conversation, continuing a conversation, transitions, topics of conversation, etc. The reason I knocked off one star is because each category the author gives taxonomies (IE: The 5 types of conversation killers), but does not go on to direct the reader on how to correct this behavior. One other pitfall I found in the book is the amount of \"confidence building\" or \"ego stroking\" the author conveys, although I understand the audience and reason for this, it is a little too much at times.\n\nOverall I think this book is great, especially for people who experience anxiety with social situations as I do. With that being said, the book does not do the work for you, but it does prepare you on how to effectively make social situations more successful. I even gave it to my intern, who is a recent college grad, and has been open about her anxiety at professional mixers, and she found it very helpful. Some of the advice can easily be implemented very successfully the same day as reading, which I found to give me a big confidence boost.",

    "Develops ideas at but does not provide insightful in-depth examples to use in real life. Examples given are impractical and cannot be used in real life - hard to decide whether its laziness or lack of knowledge on the author side for such poor examples.",
    "There's a cheat list for you to prepare you in any social situations. There's no excuse for me now to not have enough things to talk about with absolutely anyone. Practice, practice, practice.",

    "Got an older version of this book which just started reading..and is great and so helpful!..so ordered a spare 2nd hand copy :) 😊👍",
    "After a light hearted beginning, book settles into being an interesting and helpful read. Would recommend to anyone uneasy in public situations, workplace or social gatherings."

    "Dr Dalton-Smith's discussion of the seven types of rest was eye opening for me and I thoroughly benefited from the first part of the book. The second part was not as captivating for me as the first; hence, my rating of four. I would recommend this book.",
    "Nothing disliked",
    "I absolutely love this book. I’ve boughten some as gifts. As someone who is delivered from going, going and going this book really opened my eyes. It’s a book that I know I can read in different seasons of my life just to refresh and remember how important rest is and the different types of rest.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this book. I believe it’s a book that everyone can benefit from. It makes you really revaluate what’s truly important and to remember how to value time.\n\nThis book has helped me embrace rest as well as peace on a different level. I feel like it was the cheat code I needed.",
    "7 types of rest. It all sounds so intriguing and impossible but she doesn’t leave you to find rest alone. She sticks with you and helps you for an additional 30 days of seeking rest to choose your best life. Truly amazing and easy read.",
    "I heard about this book during an interview on Spirit 105.3 and I was intrigued! The author explores 7 different types of rest. If we don't get the correct type that we need, we will continue to be tired or feel empty. Fabulous book!",
    "I was losing it I felt like one more step I will go off the deep in I was overwhelmed with the cares of life, trying to handle ministry, my elder mother, handle to jobs. But when I read this book I see how God desire for us to receive the best of life and its starts with the gift of Rest. I thank God for Dr. Saundra Dalton-Smith.",
    "I enjoyed this book so much, and found it so helpful, that I bought copies for friends for Christmas. I wasn't really sure what to expect but, being busy and tired during the Christmas season, the title caught my eye. It proved to be much more than I was expecting!\n\nMost of us think we are \"resting\" when we are sleeping. Too many times we think that we don't have time for adequate rest or we may misinterpret setting aside the time as selfish. The author addresses these concerns. If you're like me, you will see yourself in many of the excuses as well as the case studies. This book expands the idea of rest well beyond sleeping, physical stillness, or \"down-time.\" It is divided into short, easy-to-read and understand chapters which explain, give examples of, and encourage self-introspection into physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, social, sensory, and creative rest.\n\nWhile the author writes from an obvious Christian perspective, there is nothing overbearing or nonscientific in her writing. Being a physician, she has witnessed and testifies to evidence and to numerous case studies of consequences of deficiency in the various forms of rest. She actually incorporates scientific/medical evidence to support her claims and observations. Overall. the author does a masterful job in blending the tones of a best friend, your physician, and a spiritual mentor into one helpful conversation and motivational tool. I was especially encouraged by the second half of the book where Dr, Dalton-Smith goes into more details explaining the gifts we receive as we observe a more rested life...gifts including: boundaries, reflection, freedom, acceptance, and productivity. I also like the additional resources including the Personal Rest Deficit Assessment Tool and the link to a Thirty Day Sacred Rest Challenge.\n\nI definitely recommend this book for personal study and reflection, self-help, and spiritual growth. Also makes a great gift!",
    "This was recommended to me by a therapist. It is terrible. No practical ideas about rest, just banging on and shoving Christianity down the readers throat. I couldn’t even finish it.",
    "I have valued the practical applications of the ideas of this book! It breaks down the 7 types of rest, signs that indicate which rest you may be lacking, and has a writing style that is accessible and easy to engage with!",
    "There are a lot of references to the Christian god throughout the book. If that doesn’t bother you, then there’s a fair amount of good material.",
    "I was expecting this book to be medical- and science-based and offering practical solutions but definitely did not expect to read about Christianity on every page. It should have been mentioned in the book's summary or at least somewhere so that readers who do not follow Christianity or any religion are aware of it before buying this book.. unfortunately I could neither enjoy this book nor learn anything from it, not to mention finish reading it. Very sad!",
    "great read. Goes to the experience of a medical professionals breakdown and the experience and journey of encountering sacred rest through seven different themes. Simple reading with enjoyable content and personal experience in between. There's also additional information to help assess yourself when it comes to stress and where you seem to be rest deficient. The practical applications are very simple to follow through. It's you need to read it from a doctor's perspective in their personal life"

    "Every African American should own this book to reverse the economics in your community. Lots of important history here that you won't learn in school! This should be given out for birthdays, Christmas and just because! A must have!",
    "The thing that strikes me most regarding Powernomics by Dr. Anderson is his insight into politics, of which he played a integral role,is one often not expressed to the Black constituency. His basic premise for much of the book is:\n1)Pool Black resources; allow the Black dollar to \"bounce\" a number of times in the Black community before it exits. He uses other ethnic groups that don't by from Black businesses nor hire Black employees as an example of how they pool retain the power of their money.\n2)The original intent of Affirmative action programs were initiated to undo the social/economic inequalities created by chattel slavery; creating a permanent underclass. After the various programs were introduce, other \"minorities\" who have not received the structural inequalities to the extent of African americans, and who were considered white when immigrating to the US edged out the AA and monies. This effectively put them on the bottom of receiving programs that were initially intended for them.\n3)African Americans/Blacks must look out for Blacks and not be afraid to requires quid pro quo of politicians for their vote like every other constituency except according to Anderson, Blacks; they are just happy to vote.\n4)Refuse to treat any other group better than they treat you as a group.\n\nI agree with Dr. Anderson on most things, but a few things to mention where I think he missed it in Powernomics. 1)His critique of Booker T Washington, seems misplaced. Washington, advocated for exactly what Powernomics proclaims; entrepreneurship and economic development. He was Garvey's mentor, though not directly, inspiring him to come to the US. The historical Booker T. would have been better than the gossip Booker T. of what people thought of him. 2)I would have expected a more cited book. Some of the things mentioned don't mention a citation, especially when they are controversial and thought to be wrong. There are some citations, but with the numerous claims made, more are definitely warranted. 3)He mentions routinely the Willie Lynch Letter which has been proven to be a forged letter of the 20th century. This is problematic in that some of the conclusions that people may make according to this letter may provide a false state of the condition of Black America.\n\nThis is a good book and I am glad to have purchased it. I will re read it, put it together with some other books for my own communities liberation.\n\nAnother book that does some of Powernomics with a 1/4 less is Black Economics: Solutions for Economic and Community Empowerment by Jawanza Kunjufu. Also Blueprint for Black Power by Amos Wilson, which goes in the other direction in terms of pages(800+).\n\nIn all this is a good book and it is definitely great to start you off in Black Economics/pooling your resources. The political bloc portion may be a little difficult in that we seemed to be in bed with the whole of all minorites, but it seems necessary to start acting as \"group\" to have our needs addressed. It will be interesting to see how he implements his plans, inspite of the backlash from other groups and the various betrayals associated with embarking upon such a monumental task.",
    "Although nothing new here it reads a lot like malcolms o.a.a.u. model,focusing on economic,social and political group power.He advocates community control of schools,churches and businesses(he vividly points out the failure of intergration) practicing ethno-aggregation or control of our own resources(creating our own monopolies)to put blacks in a better position to compete with and/or beat other racial groups. again these ideas are not new.He argues that blacks haven't progressed(economically anyway) much since the late 19th century and since we now occupy a third place position in the U.S. this program or ideas could be the answer for the few exceptional black men whom are RESPONSIBLE!!! enough to put into implementation.",
    "His first book was a masterpiece and a must read I expect this one will be the same",
    "Modern day Joseph. There's so much truth in here, it's a wonder why churches don't preach from it. Wasn't it the church that taught us tell the truth and shame the devil? Dr. Anderson really had me questioning: Why are we afraid to demand reparations, respect, and government resources? Why is it okay for other groups, but not for us? Why aren't our spiritual leaders healing us from the trauma of slavery, Jim Crow, and government mandated ignorance and poverty and brainwashing? Why aren't black educators teaching the truth about how slavery drove the industrial revolution and the debt America refuses to acknowledge it still owes its black citizens. I love how he proves his point with illustrations. I had to pause and reflect many times on the truth made known to me by reading this book. I realized how just how brainwashed I was. Before this book, I had little idea of how responsible (culpable really) government was for the present and past plight of black people. I believed that racism was prejudice. And I never considered that black people have a good reason (damn good reason) to be prejudiced against white people, for example, the hispanics taking over black music and trying to replace blacks as the majority minority; how many times have blacks been pushed to the bottom of the ladder? I have to admit that reading the book made me not want to be black. Who wants to be on a team that won't play or plays to just play, not win? I'm mad I have to sit out and lose by default because my team is brainwashed to not play together. And I have kids that need a community that loves them enough to protect them. I feel like being black means I'm unprotected, and who's helping me protect my kids? I believe Dr. Anderson's assessment of our social and economic situation. I'd have real hope if our churches believed it too. But I'm still going to do my part to empower the next generation.",
    "What I took from this is that the author makes the case for why Integration has not worked and will never work, along with the very negative and unintended consequences of the outcomes of the Civil Rights Movement and government programs that became all inclusive of all 'minority groups' when they should have been directed only to and specifically to African-American descendants of slavery. The author proposes how Black America can take back their neighborhoods and build communities with unified purpose and economic benefit. My only disappointment is the author failed to even acknowledge or cover the need for Black families to be actual and real family units versus what appears to exist in today's society - many (not all) Black women have many children with different men; many (but not all) black men impregnate many different women and with little regard for parental responsibilities, thus creating immediately broken homes. This should really have been step 1 in his Powernomics Plan, imho.",

    "Most people can't negotiate at all. They think they can but that's because they haven't defined what it means to win in a negotation. For instance I have a friend who is an aggressive and competitive negotiator who almost always wants to win and for his opponent to lose (WIN - lose). His problem is that he almost always loses but doesn't consider it a loss since he moves the goal posts or he starts to play another game. He goes from a game of business negotiation, loses, then makes it a moral issue where he believes he wins. In fact he loses that too. To top it all off he is also very emotional so he argues from emotion, not logic.\nThis book would help him. He could see that in most of his big moralistic wins he actually lost and lost big. He would have seen that he was in an inferior position when it came to leverage. Often times he had a lot to lose and a lot to win but since his goal was to win 100% he often lost that much. He came away with nothing. If armed with this book he would know better and would try to get as much as he could in his inferior position. He would be negotiating with logic and not emotion. He would define \"winning\" in a different way.\nHowever we need not dwell on my friend. Let me tell you what I took away from this book. I learned that figuring out a person's negotiating style and determining who had the leverage were the most important things. If I come across a compromising person with a lot of leverage I become an aggressive negotiator and I try to get as much as possible without losing the deal. If somebody is a weak negotiator I am ruthless regardless of their leverage. If I have all the leverage and nothing to lose I'll be aggressive again. I compromise when I know I have little to know leverage but I never give up that fact to the person I'm negotiating with. Lastly, I always try to make the deal be perceived as a win-win no matter what I was thinking. They get some of what they want but I got most of all I want.\nHowever, I have learned more about negotiating since this book so let me tell you that this is not the end-all, be-all of negotiating books. Read others, take seminars, research different approaches and you'll get better and better. This book gives an amazing foundation for you. It's taught in some law school negotiation classes and it's on a lot of business school class syllabi. It will frame your thinking on negotiations and teach you to be logical instead of emotional.\nThe book is practical, logical and can be applied the same day you read it. If you read one business book this year read this one. The other is just noise (unless it's another classic in negotiating.)",
    "This book was part of the required reading for my business school negotiation class. It is full of good tips and techniques to help you reach a deal that is beneficial for both you and your negotiating partner. It is all about being fair while firm for the things that you really care about.",
    "This is an excellent book on negotiation. These are some things I liked about the book:\n\n1) It makes for an entertaining read. Shell uses interesting stories and examples to illustrate his points, so the book never feels too theoretical or academic.\n\n2) It is comprehensive and great for beginners. Part I covers the six foundations of effective negotiation, while Part II goes through each step of the negotiation process in detail. There is even a lengthy chapter on ethics.\n\n3) It provides negotiation advice that is tailored to both the negotiation context (e.g. where your relationship with the other party is important vs where it is not) and the individual negotiator's natural inclinations (there is a test included in the book to help you determine what type of negotiator you are). The latter is particular helpful because most books on negotiation simply teach a particular negotiating style, without considering that a person's personality might prevent him from effectively adopting a particular style.\n\n4) It is well-written and systematically organised. While each chapter is quite long, they are broken down into bite-size chunks through liberal use of headings. This makes it easy to read the book over many brief sittings (as I did). There are also point-form summaries at the end of each section and/or useful diagrams that recap what has been taught.\n\n5) It is intelligent and substantial. Shell brings in insights from psychology (he draws heavily on Cialdini's work) and his job as a negotiation teacher at Wharton Business School, so I never felt like I was reading fluff. And even where Shell's points are not original, he manages to \"value-add\" by presenting them in a framework that makes them easier to understand and implement.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in negotiation.",
    "I actually found this to be a pretty interesting read, which I think is saying something about a negotiation book.\n\nI picked this up to help with my career in general - I didn't have any upcoming negotiations I was worried about, but I do have to negotiate on behalf of myself and my employer fairly frequently, and it's an area I've looked to improve at. I wasn't expecting to really learn that much about it from a book, but Shell lays things out in a simple and easy-to-follow way that makes sense and is easy to remember. There are plenty of tips, not just about how to negotiate but how to develop your own negotiation style. And while he clearly favors some styles over others, he's upfront about this and still manages to give advice for those who choose to go a different route.\n\nI haven't had a chance to put my new knowledge to the test yet, but at the very least I feel confident that the next negotiation I step into, I'll know how to prepare and what to look for. And if I don't feel confident at the time, this book includes an appendix to help you organize negotiation prep ahead of time as well.",
    "The author explains the psychological, ethical and philosophical motivations behind negotiation strategies. And asks the reader to look honestly at their own personality before deciding how to craft a negotiation.\n\nThe book is packed full of insightful examples, from securing a discount on a tie to buying mineral deposits on another continent.\n\nThe author writes in a confident manner that clearly comes from years of negotiating experience, researching a wide-range of negotiations and teaching others to negotiate.\n\nVery helpful text.",
    "Great book. Wish it was reprinted as better than nearly all other negotiation theory books. Buy if you have an engineering mindset.",
    "The first couple of chapters of this book seem a bit weak, and I don't see much value in the 'what kind of negotiating style do you have' personality test. However, get past this first hurdle, and the rest of the book is a practical goldmine in terms of real negotiating experience and advice for different situations.",
    "Come la maggior parte dei libri su questi argomenti, leggendoli viene anche da dire: \"ma è ovvio\", però chissà perché non facciamo mai quello che \"poi\" ci pare ovvio. Ad ogni modo scrittura scorrevole e ricca di esempi. Un test curioso sullo stile di negoziazione. Insomma, se vi intriga l'argomento negoziazione, ve lo consiglio... dal basso della mia esperienza :)",
    "Buone premesse, buon quadro teorico ed esempi illuminanti. Di approccio - per i miei gusti - troppo anglosassone perché nella realtà non è sempre facile “incasellare” situazioni e/o comportamenti umani in una matrice. L’aspetto tarnsculturale della mediazione sarebbe stato da approfondire. Tutto sommato una buona lettura."

    "I wanted a book that explains how to value stocks. I didn’t want a book that glosses over how it’s done. Perhaps it didn’t need over 800 pages, and there’s repetition. Readers like me who’ve never had a finance class may have to read it slowly. Occasionally values in tables appear without explaining formulas used. The formulas and rigor increases with each new chapter. The biggest drawback is offering for sale an expensive spreadsheet sold separately rather than included. I’ll try making my own after reading the whole book.",
    "Overall, this is a very useful book. It's intended for people already familiar with basic accounting principles and financial statement analysis. By reading the book the reader can learn the parts of the financial statement to focus on to spot malfeasance. My only complaint is that some chapters are a bit repetitive and some of the examples of real-world financial chicanery are dated.",

Various economic sectors are reported for a comprehensive visioning of different aspects in valuation processing ( bank, insurance, industrial, etc) .

Hard cover\nExist also a version with possibility of accessing to excel spreadsheets.",
    "\"Growth=ROIC×Investment Rate\" \"... Since the three variables are tied together mathematically, you can describe the company's performance with any two variables.\"\n\nWhy it's wrong - \"performance\" isn't something mystical but a behavior (it's in *reality*: isn't it?). The organizational processes that result in the behavior of \"growth\" are tied to behavior: your model is going to be wrong (it might even eliminate the indicators that aren't easily measured). This makes your assumption a very broad topic with plenty of room for changes - so the behavior is not describing what is happening for the measurable organizational objectives you still identify.",
    "This is the premier book on valuation for investors, managers and board members. A thorough presentation of DCF applications in context of various companies and markets. Not a quick read but each example contains a ton of scenarios that show the effects of the theory presented making the analysis come to life. Excellent book!!!",
    "I'm giving it a 5 because it is a thorough resource and it's not too difficult to follow. I like the language and approach in this book vs Damodarans, although I like studying his content too.\n\nI took business as my undergrad over 10 years ago, haven't been studying anything related since then. With that as my base, I'm able to understand and apply the content in this book with a moderate effort- there's a lot of nuance and relating the terminology used from one source is often very different from the terminology in other sources.\n\nA lot of specifics are included, I'm mainly interested in the value of businesses for investment purposes. For that, this is quite comprehensive, it explains how mainly growth, return on invested capital and free cash flow drive the future success of an enterprise. Many methods are included to elaborate on these elements and how to use them to calculate a businesses value.\n\nI do wish the book was streamlined a bit better. I find myself flipping all throughout the book for content I'd expect to see more grouped in one area.\n\nBottom line it is a solid book/resource on understanding and applying valuation principles to businesses.",

    "The Valuation guide and the workbook are extensive in words but short on practicality validation.\n\nMy biggest disappointment is the lack of Excel working for me to test my knowledge.\n\nThe preface says the Excel spreadsheet model is available via Web download.\n\nIt is a false claim. It is not available.\n\nExcel is available only when you buy another book, twice the price, to get the access code.\n\nI am disappointed. Not Wiley standard.\n\nCompared with Aswath Damodaran's Valuation book, this Wiley's book falls flat.\n\nAll of Aswath's books, including Excel Working on valuations, are free to download.",
    "Esto es culpa de Amazon que no protege los paquetes cuando son frágiles como es debido...\nPara compras de libros recomiendo buscar otras plataformas especializadas es libros ya que te lo envían con más cariño",
    "Feels like the book is not an original copy. It is in black & white (I have the ebook to which is in colour), and pages are stuck together, etc.\n\nThe actual book is good but printing quality is really low"

    "This book builds on \"Crucial Conversations\" by the same authors, so read and practice with \"CC\" first.\n\n\"Crucial Accountability\" extends \"Crucial Conversations\" methods into cases where things have already gone wrong: blown deadlines, broken rules, and other bad behavior.

I found that practicing \"Crucial Accountability\" also helped me get a much better grasp of the lessons from the prior book.",

This book, as it’s counterpart, is useful in business, personal life and life in general.",
    "Really loved the first couple chapters. Although it seemed too many at times having examples of both work and personal issues helped to frame the concepts well. For me it seemed this book lost a little horsepower after the first few chapters. The concept of accountability comes from an authoritarian view rather than one of mutual benefit. I wish a few more chapters could have been written on personal accountability as I think one needs to master this before attempting to hold others accountable.\n\nGood read overall. I would recommend.",

This one I did finish and my thoughts are better due this book and promoting positive thinking. It is perfect for a book club too as that is how I got to read it all so quickly. A certified five star book.",
    "Good book. Easy reading. Good reminders of the importance of positivity.",
    "I loved the great easily digestible content and as a sports fan all of the sports references were really helpful. I wish I would have had this book over the years to help encourage teams to be more positive.\n\nI've only recently found Jon Gordon and am in love with his books. Just a great author!",
    "i really liked this book. i used it for my team and we all read it and it helped us look in the positive side of life",
    " Jon Gordon has done it again with \"The Power of a Positive Team.\" He has taken his encouraging words of positivity, love, caring, and team work and bundled them into a book that speaks volumes. There are so many tidbits and words of wisdom that anyone who is a member of a team can benefit from reading. You say you aren't part of a team? What about your family, your work, your friends? We are all part of a team and this book is for you.\n\nSome favorite parts:\n\"When you walk into the office, or the meeting, or into the school, hospital, or locker room, you have a decision to make. Are you going to be a germ to your team or a big dose of Vitamin C?\"\n\"[Teams] give up because the obstacle seems more powerful than them and they don't have the faith to keep moving forward. But you don't have to give up. You don't have to let fear win. You can know that all things are possible to a team that believes.\"\n\nNear the end of the book, Jon talks about the Greek word Meraki: to do something with love, soul, and creativity; to leave a piece of yourself in your work; to leave something behind. Thank you Jon Gordon for this piece of work and for your meraki.",
    "This is a great read! So helpful to any leader and for team development. Highly recommend!",
    "I was fortunate to receive a pre-launch copy of The Power of a Positive Team.\n\nJon places a number of examples of the traits that positive teams exhibit. He also sets the book up to be used by teams as a \"self-study\" or guide to becoming a positive team.\n\nA couple of my favorite quotes from this book are:\n\n1. \"Positive teams confront the reality of challenging situations and work together to overcome them.\"\n\n2. \"It’s a purpose beyond oneself that truly drives and energizes people and teams.\"\n\n3. \"Don’t run from the difficult conversation. Don’t be scared of feedback. It is not meant to define you. It’s meant to help refine you so you can do your job better for your team.\"\n\nIf you lead a team at school, sports, business, or simply your family at home, this book is for you.",
    "So, everyone who knows me, knows that I am a HUGE Jon Gordon fan. I have read all of his books and I believe that they are amazing. I have been thankful to be a part of not one, not two, but three of his book launches. I have to tell you that this book “speaks” to me. Those that have worked with me and several that worked for me know that I am all about the team and making sure they are balanced in assignments, home life and general well being. This book helps to reiterate that and gives helpful tips and ideas for the how.\n\nI truly recommend that if you are part of a team and you want to help yourself to be a better team mate then read this book!!! #positiveteambook",
    "I had a chance to read an advance copy of the soon to be released \"The Power of a Positive Team\" by @jongordon11 and it is a homerun! If you work with a team of any kind you need to read this book.",
    "Costo - beneficio excelente.",
    "I really enjoy Jon Gordon's books. Easy to read yet have practical applications.",
    "Jai adoré ce livre !! Tout les gens qui sont soir coach, leader d'une équipe, prof, etc devraient lire ce livre !!!",
    "A great read for anyone with a team struggling to stay positive!"

    "In a PM library, Teresa's CDH book should rank #2 on the most-wanted list (Marty Cagan's Inspired is #1).\nGiven the vastly increasing set of resources and books in the PM space, this is indeed a bold statement but IMO, this is well deserved.\n\nAs a PM practitioner, I'm grateful that such an important topic (product discovery!) has met such a brilliant, structured, and systematic mind in Teresa. The book is comprehensive on the topic, starting with history, then foundational principles, and delving into all the practical aspects of practice. Teresa’s clarity of thought gives her writing perfect nuance, and the content is never over-stated nor does she make any overly broad sweeping claims.\n\nWhat makes her advice in the book so powerful is that the book is built on years / decades of practice. She is not just a teacher, but a coach - who in real life helps product teams across industries / companies / company stages & sizes implement these principles daily. This makes her advice very practical and pragmatic - just what you need to start making wins in your workplace tomorrow, while over time winning converts to a better way of working.\n\nThis is a book for the entire product team, especially the product trio i.e., the product manager, designer, and technical lead. I have already made improvements in the way we approach product discovery, and my team loves me for it!\n\nI also enjoyed the audio-book as well, which was narrated by Teresa herself. Did not skip a second, and re-listened to many sections. Great investment!\n\nTo people like Teresa (& Marty), I have only 2 things to say: Thank you, and I wonder what you will write about next?",
    "I’m a software developer tired of working in feature factories. Tired of giving “demos” for sign off to a Product Owner - a person so far removed from an actually customer that I have no idea about the impact or desirability of the features that I am asked to develop, “to spec” - that none of my creativity and insight has ever been sought in its creation.\n\nThis book fills me with hope for a better way to create products and revitalize my job. To create a direct connection between my efforts, the purpose of the organization, and the customers themselves.\n\nI will be promoting these ideas everywhere I can.",
    "You will grow as a product person and as an entrepreneur. That’s all you need to know.\n\nThere’s nowhere else to find this rich information about product discovery on the internet, not even producttalk.org",
    "Anyone doing software\ndevelopment should read this book. Discovery should happen throughout the development life cycle, and the use of OST make it interesting.",
    "I picked this book up because I was interested in improving research techniques and workflows.\n\nIt did an excellent job describing an effective framework for product teams to use when building products for customers. The decision-making strategy is completely agnostic and could be applied to basically any industry. It's very accessible and easy to understand.\n\nThe anti-pattern chapter summaries are a huge help if you want to share the book with colleagues who might benefit from the content, but may not be product leads.\n\nIt makes a very compelling argument for adoption, so if there are any VP or C-Suite people looking for ways to reduce risk, build better products, and need a very manageable primer, this is an excellent book.\n\nSECOND EDITION REQUEST: One thing that might have helped is offering some insight on project organization or software that could support each stage of the process.\n\nTruly, the approaches are powerfully simple, post-its and whiteboards are more than adequate to start. But as more information is gathered, you might soon outgrow your whiteboard. I can see where making sure research/feedback/decisions remain searchable and intelligible from Day 1 to Year 5 will become more important.\n\nI know recommendations can get dangerously close to endorsement, or worse yet, creating a \"right way\" mentality that's strongly discouraged throughout the book. But it would be interesting to know how mature teams grew into their tooling solutions.",
    "The book provides a great overview of how to incorporate continuous discovery habits into one's product work, while also providing concrete examples and case studies. There are plenty of things to incorporate into one's own workflow, but its clear writing style is also useful for helping clarify things you may already be implementing.\n\nThere are diagrams and charts in the book, which I am glad to say were easy to read on a Kindle (which isn't always the case). Particular highlights included the section on opportunity trees, customer interviews, and emphasising the role of partnership and collaboration with your peers and stakeholders. It also does a good job of highlighting the iterative nature that this work requires. A great book, and would recommend it to anyone involved in product work!",
    "Short, sharp, and excellently presented framework of practices for product discovery work. Teresa has done a wonderful job of creating a book that will take you through the process of doing research-backed product work step-by-step.\n\nIt also has my favourite pattern for practice based books where each chapter ends with a “Common Anti-Patterns” section where it lists the ways you can mess up a particular approach.\n\nVery recommended. Already copies of this on some of my clients :-)",
    "If there was one book I would recommend to someone starting out in product management that wanted to get the lay of the land in all things discovery, this would be it.\n\nThis book is filled with discovery habits theory, but presented in a way that makes it easy to understand and actionable. I’ll certainly be referring back to these techniques as I move forward in my product management career.\n\nWhat particularly impressed me was something that a lot of product books don’t address: how to actually implement these habits if you are not in charge.\n\nWhether it’s discovery habits or something else, sometimes companies will already have their own practices that seem impossible to change on a big scale — and that’s okay. Torres describes how the way to make changes is just how you improve a good product — incrementally. By focusing on what you can control (your own work habits), you can make little changes that will eventually have a big impact, while avoiding the stress of thinking you can’t make a difference.\n\nPractical tips like these are given throughout her book, which makes it a joy to read and refer back to.",
    "Just finished reading the recently published book “Continuous Discovery Habits” by Teresa Torres.\nI was familiar with Teresa’s opportunity tree and approach to discovery having read several of her articles on Product Talk and listened to her talks; I have to say though that her book brings it all together and to a new level!\nThe book is written in clear language, easy to read and packed with many examples and case studies. It is a step-by-step guide to product discovery.\n\nThe book has been instrumental to the work we have been doing as a team over the past months and to become a more user-centred organisation.",
    "Teresa does a fantastic job at taking an immensely difficult and diverse topic, and simplifying it into a 200 page handbook detailing the process and the reason for doing it. Along the way she highlights common anti patterns and packs the book full of pragmatic 'on the ground' insights.\n\nMy favourite part was on testing assumptions. I have been doing product management for 5 years now, and I was amazed to learn I had been doing aspect of discovery, spectacularly wrong!\n\nIf you are in a product team, this book should be in the must read pile and at the top, next to SVPG and Marc Andreessen."

    "I agree with other comments charts could have been better. Could have color which makes it a little harder to read in black and white but not impossible just a little harder. Book is small, easy to understand and right to the point. For a beginner or newbie I think is a great starting point which will make you understand more about charting, graphs, and how to read them. I don't know why so many negative comments. Books is a five but gave it a four bc is in black and white. Again, no bad to read just a little harder.",
    "It is very difficult to follow the charts because they are not in color and too blurry to make out. Author gave good explanations, but having to use a magnifier to read the prices & candlesticks blew it for me, otherwise I’d probably give it a five.",
    "This book is definitely helping me understand how to read a stock chart. So much Great Information!!",
    "The person I bought it for said it was ok not bad not good just ok.",
    "Give a real good view of technical analysis basics. Simple and clear with a lot of good information. A must read",
    "As a trader I see red and green. I want my charts red and green. It makes them easier to read. I don't want to do extra thinking while I'm learning. The book does its best clarify, and with the full charts it's obvious which are which. Now that the negative is out of the way this is an amazing book! I'd recommend it to anyone that was thinking of doing any trading of any kind. Lots of aha moments to be had in this book. I will be reading this book 10 to 15 times and beyond. I now have a better understanding of how the market works, what moves it, and how to better read the story the charts are telling. I would pay $50 for a color version.",
    "So I would say I'm a beginner investor. I don't really know much about the stock market and I honestly thought at the beginning that all you had to do was buy and hold... Mostly because of some information I read about Warren Buffett.\n\nWith this book I feel I have a slightly better understanding of what is going on and how to read a chart, more than I did in the beginning. I still don't feel entirely confident that I won't trade against the market. But I believe the more I practice and study the better I'll get at analyzing the market. And I wouldn't be able to do that without the explanation in this book.\n\nI liked that the author didn't waste anytime in explaining about technical analysis. I also enjoyed that the author explained this in a way that someone who is a beginner can begin their journey into the world of investing.\n\nThis is the type of knowledge that needs to be taught in school, so that when we send young adults out into the world they have more tangible information to be more financially literate than they are currently.",
    "Great book and content. But the charts are blurry and in grayscale. I think the author originally provided color and clearer images but the publisher messed them up.\n\nI bought the softcover. Maybe the hardcover has images in color and clarity.",
    "This book is not an original copy.\nappalling that amazon is selling counterfeit goods!\nall pictures are photocopied and in black and white which defeats the purpose of having a book which teaches you to read charts as both candles in this FAKE book are in black no differentiation of which is green or red.\n\nAvoid.",
    "positive:\nThis is a really easy read - things made simple.\nI read half the book in a couple of days over a few hours.\n\nNegative:\nShooting star, evening star, pretty poorly explained. They need to go back and complete this.\nIt's not saying what you do when you see it on the rise/fall.... and what it means. So why put it in the\nbook when you clearly don't understand it yourself. Very important concepts with charting and not explained clearly or enough",
    "This is a first rate guide to intermediate level charting. I Will need to read it a couple more times to take it all in but it's very accessible and easy to understand with practical examples. I have read a large number of books on charting and investing and this is possibly the most accessible book on charting I have come across. I would strongly recommend reading this before going into more advanced charting books like Pring's for example which is heavy going. I would classify this as Required Reading",
    "The book covers an explanation of the symbols used in charting but the claims made, that these\nsymbolic indicators suggest a market direction, is voodoo. This is not the author's fault since he is merely relating the pocket industry theory.\nIt is not possible to detect the trend with this kind of analysis.\nHowever, what I would say is that if you intend to be a serious investor this book is very useful to understand the language of the market. I recommend Amazon buy \" Buffett's 2 - Step Stock Market Strategy and would state that investing is a long term strategy to preserve your savings from inflation depletion and hopefully pick up additional % gains over the years. This book is a good research reference but don't think it will make you money because it will not.",
    "If you're trying to learn the basics of trading, this is your book. It can be hard to understand, and you will need time to understand things, but the book is amazing, you will learn a lot from it. I preferred to avoid the digital version, is not for me ."

    "This book shares the need for everyone to work on the body mind and soul. In todays world , where everything is going at 100x speed, we need to learn to achieve stillness and calm, and at the end (which is our death) be able to have lived the journey happy and free",
    "This is the fourth Ryan Holiday book I have read. The other three were Ego is the Enemy, The Obstacle is the Way, and Conspiracy. Like those three books, this book is an excellent read as well. I especially like the way in which Holiday writes. He makes his points using historical figures and events to do so and his writing style is easy to read and understand.\n\nDisclaimer. I am well aware of how many people who should know about such things recommend that people SHOULD engage in stillness or meditation. I have tried and have failed primarily because when I attempt at stillness and quietness, my head wants to explode because of the long-time suffering from Tinnitus, the ringing in my head that never ceases and is enhanced whenever I am in total silence. It is very depressing to say the least. Yet even for me, this book is God-sent because it reinforces a life you would want to live by. It is extremely difficult for me to imagine someone reading this book and not improving their outlook on life. It is that good.\n\nThat aside, I still found Holiday’s book fascinating. The following quote from book explains why YOU should read it as well as anyone who you value in life: “Confucius and his followers spoke constantly of the cultivation of wisdom, saying that it is achieved in the same way that a craftsman develops skill: by putting in the time.” Everyone could benefit from reading this book but I would suggest that everyone over the age of four should at least read the chapter titled Limit Your Inputs. Holiday is so very much on target and when you read just this one chapter you KNOW that he is and you can probably see yourself in the people he describes and trust me, that is NOT a good thing.\n\nHoliday’s book is a well written “how to” book on creating a better life not only for you but also for the people that surround you that you love and who love you. A quote from the book is right on point when it comes to defining the value of maintaining a personal journal: “That is what journaling is about. It’s spiritual windshield wipers, as the writer Julia Cameron once put it.”\n\nWho should read this book? From the book: “People who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read.” If YOU read this book and just practice some of Holiday’s advice, your life would be a better for having read it. If two read it, double the results. But if an entire country were to read and practice its lessons, the world would truly be a better place to live for eternity! Everyone should read and practice this book.\n\nWould I read it again? There would be no need, except to locate specific quotes from people throughout history that you may want to use.\n\nWould I give it as a gift? ABSOLUTELY!",
    "This is my first book by Ryan Holiday, and I must say, I'm not overly impressed. The book wavers back and forth between insightful and inane. There is some useful advice, to be sure, including the benefits of being fully present, limiting inputs to prevent information overload, cultivating silence, turning off your cell-phone, and embracing the Stoic virtues of optimism, honesty, courage, justice, toleration, gratitude, and wisdom. This is all good advice, if not necessarily original or better covered by other Stoic philosophers.\n\nBut it is into the second part of the book where it all starts to fall apart, leading up to the cliche-fest that is the chapter titled “Accepting a Higher Power.” I get the unfortunate impression that Holiday doesn’t understand the difference between religion and philosophy. For someone supposedly well-versed in the practice of Stoicism, talk of “surrendering to a higher power” is entirely antithetical to the philosophy. Stoicism teaches us that the greatest goods are reason and virtue, and that the cultivation of virtue is entirely independent of anything external to ourselves and the people around us.\n\nHoliday writes, “There is no stillness to the mind that thinks of nothing but itself.” This is supposed to imply that some sort of religious faith in a higher power is necessary for a meaningful life, as if a sense of awe cannot be achieved by, for example, looking through the Hubble Space Telescope, or that actually helping other people isn’t a better way to be selfless than praying. I’ll admit that I’m growing tired of reading authors projecting their own psychology into the text and assuming that those lacking religious faith are selfish and miserable. Science and humanism are enough for me, and for many other Stoics, humanists, atheists, and agnostics, thank you.\n\nHoliday also betrays his lack of training as a professional philosopher when he insists, more than once, that if many different people believed something in the past, it must be true. This “appeal to the bandwagon” fallacy is constantly repeated, with the implication that because belief in a deity was widespread in the past that it must be true. As Holiday writes, “That was the story with Lincoln. Like many smart young people, he was an atheist early in life, but the trials of adulthood, especially the loss of his son and the horrors of the Civil War, turned him into a believer.” It’s interesting to note that Holiday doesn’t mention David Hume, Bertrand Russell, Jeremey Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Denis Diderot, John Dewey, and most contemporary philosophers and scientists that were or are atheists. (Diderot and Russell didn’t have easy lives, both being imprisoned for their beliefs. But neither “smart young person” recanted their atheism later in life.)\n\nAnd here’s some condescension for you: Holiday writes, in the chapter on accepting a higher power, “Perhaps you’re not ready to do that, to let anything into your heart. That’s okay. There’s no rush. Just know that this step is open to you. It’s waiting. And it will help restore you to sanity when you’re ready.”\n\nIf you enjoy being talked down to like this, you’ll love the book!\n\nThe structure of the book is also somewhat redundant. It’s broken up into three parts: mind, spirit, and body. However, the chapters titled “Say No” and “Seek Solitude” in the body section are largely a repeat of the chapters titled “Limit Your Inputs” and “Cultivate Silence” in the mind section. There is, in fact, a lot of redundancy found throughout the book, along with a large dose of empty phrases with little substance.\n\nThere are, to be fair, some redeeming qualities. The numerous biographical details are interesting, and, again, there is some genuinely good advice, particularly when Holiday sticks closest to Stoicism. However, this is not something I could recommend. I think you’d be better off reading the classics of Stoicism or contemporary philosophers specializing in Stoicism like Massimo Pigliucci.",
    "Full of wisdom! Gifting to our nephews that are graduating this year.",
    "Distracted minds are commonplace in today's world.\n\nWith information overload, lots of people have forgotten how to be more present and in the moment. Maybe this is why mindfulness has become so popular. Boredom is something that people hate with a device needed to keep us company and our minds indulged, even when waiting in the shortest of queues or period of inactivity.\n\nFrom a peak performance perspective, stillness as Ryan describes it becomes really important to maintain focus and presence during overwhelming chaos and stress.\n\nThis is a small book but packed with richness. Ryan uses stories of Abraham Lincoln, John F Kennedy, Marina Abramovic, Napoleon, Shawn Green, Fred Rogers, Anne Frank, Socrates, John Cage, Awa Kenzo, Marcus Aurelius, Tiger Woods, Seneca, Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Jordan, Winston Churchill, Epictetus, William Gladstone and many others.\n\nRyan uses these to demonstrate how important stillness is for self-mastery, discipline and focus in this noisy world.\n\nThe book divided into three parts:\n\n1. Mind\n2. Spirit\n3. Body\n\nEach part has several chapters making the case for stillness and giving life practices that can help to practically develop stillness.\n\nI do feel that the book could have more practical tips but for me it really does help with stirring the emotions and helping to really value the importance of stillness in my life and finding ways to develop this.\n\nFor me this topic is really important. I previously read Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and have also pre-ordered Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose/dp/1526610221/\n\nI will be reading this book a few times to inspire me and develop practices to help me as I try to navigate this world of chaos. I recommend this if this is the journey you are also looking to take.",
    "If you ‘re expecting a book as good as Holiday's previous work 'The Obstacle is the Way' then this isn't it. With 'The Obstacle is the Way' Holiday stuck to one subject, stoicism, and wrote about what the stoic philosophers taught. This book deals with the more amorphous term of 'stillness' which he uses to refer to ‘peace of mind’. The subject is a worthy one but the author spends the whole book saying what you should be doing, but he doesn’t point out how you should be doing it. The subject is also one that moves into the realms of eastern philosophy and psychology, and Holiday is woefully under qualified in these areas. Instead, he uses his usual method of dividing the book into three parts and giving varied examples from the lives of famous people given to him by his researchers. These examples are often forced and he contradicts himself from one chapter to the next. For example, in one chapter he holds JFK up as an example of stillness during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and then in another chapter he condemns JFK for cheating on his wife during the same incident. He also holds Churchill up as a good example yet only lists his positive qualities, and fails to mention any of his many negative traits. The worst part for me was Holiday’s style of writing. When he was a debut author his style was direct and refreshing now he is preachy, and seems to be believing his own press. In the end this book seeks to be about an important subject, but simply becomes about the ignorance of the writer.",
    "I'm a fan of Ryan Holiday and enjoy his books and daily blogs immensely the best so far being 'The Obstacle is the Way'. Because his other publications have been so good 'Stillness is the key' is quite a disappointment. I felt there was a slight shift towards psychobabble in that he claims the protagonists of the various stories all achieved their success to stillness which is probably stretching things a bit far. I found those links to stillness to be quite weak. On the positive side there are some good stories but overall is this book just about meditation?",
    "Okay so yeahhh why did they add this one in Business Genre? After reading it like thrice I still feel it's should be in like Self-help Self-help genre or Stoicism kind of genres.\n\n➡️ So The book has small chapters, divided into various topics, topics we often want to read about but couldn't find all that in one book. Written in easy language which makes it better to read even if you're just a beginner feel free to read this one.\n\n➡️ He has talked about many points or topics that are part of our daily life, our relations, our problems, our emotional instabilities, desires and many more. He'll start chapter with someone's life story and will tell to about his highs and flaws which helps to relate more and under the topic well and at the and he'll tell you what's right thing that you can do to avoid those problems in your life.\n\n➡️ He has used examples of Stoicism, buddhism, Hinduism ( Bhagwat Gita ) to describ his point briefly in front of reader.\nAlso he's mentioned the names of books from where you can read briefly about these ' isms '\n\n➡️ What i like about book is the simplicity of it, very easy to read and understand you don't have to read it from 1st to last. You pick any chapter randomly and read it that it. No pressure to start from start, just choose the topic you want to learn or read about and read it.",
    "Stillness is the key by Ryan Holiday\n\nHaving read Ryan’s other books The obstacle is the way and Ego is the enemy I was excited to learn about this new book coming out.\n\nAs a martial artist I like the eastern philosophies Zen, Taoism, etc… So the title spoke to me.\n\nThe book, just like Ryan’s other books consists out three parts which are divided into chapters. These chapters are each a story around a theme.\n\nStories are great vehicles to get lessons across. The stories by Ryan often do more than just teach, they also inspire. Ryan who is known for being inspired by Stoicism, delves into many different backgrounds for his stories, east, west, past and present… Universal and timeless…\n\nLike classical music where the same pieces are played with different chords the book sheds a fresh light on classical teachings.\n\nWhat I like about the book is the storytelling, the easy to read stories can be easily read during a short break, not too long, not too short and they grab your attention and hold it right up to the end. Then the rest of the day you can ponder on it and try to apply it in your daily life.\n\nThe act of reading the book itself already gets you into this state of stillness. Which brings peace on a hectic day and answers to questions and problems.\n\nStillness is indeed the key. And like the Zen saying goes:\n“It is the silence between the notes that makes the music; it is the space between the bars that cages the tiger.”"

    "The Premonition – a pandemic story\nMichael Lewis\n©2021, 304 pp\n\na short Book Report by Ron Housley\n\nIn place of the usual splash of quotations by adoring fans, this book’s dustjacket has but one lonely testimonial: “I would read an 800 page history of the stapler if he wrote it.” That was exactly my own feeling about Michael Lewis when I pre-ordered my copy. But it’s not always wise to begin a new read with such high expectations, but high they were.\n\nLike several of Michael Lewis’ previous books, “The Premonition” rolls along like a train on a mission; in one of the early crescendos, the story of a courageous public health inspector roared to resolution while I had the allegro movement of Shostakovich’s Tenth playing; it was what you’d expect of a grand cinematic climax, all in the first few pages.\n\nMichael Lewis is like that; he has given us yet another great story, this time showing us what went on behind the scenes — while we were masked up and locked down. His central theme was the extraordinary government ineptness in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak — ineptness at implementation, but also ineptness in crafting a vision to include cutting-edge discoveries.\n\nNow that our country has endured over a year of 24/7, non-stop pandemic coverage, one would think we’d be on solid ground to effectively respond to the next virus. Not so.\n\nLewis shows us why we are not ready; he shows us the deeper, systemic reasons why not: (a)the institutional CYA attitude of the controlling bureaucracies; and (b)refusal of bureaucratic “experts” to admit when new knowledge has the power to legitimately question their entrenched beliefs.\n\nThe one step which could have thwarted the pandemic spread, and which did stop it in Taiwan and South Korea, was an early deployment of rapid testing, combined with isolation of the infected along with contact tracing.\n\nFor the pandemic to have been controlled, the critical bullet in the arsenal was rapid testing (and tracing) — but only if done early in the infection’s spread, and only if deployed like a focused military campaign.\n\nBut this one effective approach was itself thwarted: by the CDC, by the FDA, by political decision makers.\n\nLewis vividly shows us, step by step, how the CDC led with bureaucratic slovenliness, in a cloak of CYA protocols.\n\n(It’s little different from the FDA’s reluctance to permit new life-saving drugs because one patient may suffer while the drug rescues millions from a painful death. The FDA rarely feels the sting of criticism for obstructing a great new drug; but they fear the criticism of one single injured patient.)\n\nBoth these agencies are willing to allow millions to suffer in order to dodge criticisms for allowing one injury. As a result, the CDC was almost worse than useless in controlling the COVID-19 crisis; their refusal to endorse early testing sparked early wildfire spread of the Coronavirus. Their heel dragging was abetted by the FDA which refused to permit the many rapid tests which were already available. Their combined CYA orientation killed masses of human beings — but they are not criticized because all they did was to stand in the way.\n\nEven the meager battle that was waged with early testing could never get off the ground. Hospitals were bureaucratically incapable of accepting lab tests offered for free: their computers could not accommodate a $0 entry. Nobody in authority cared whether the test results took 3 hours or 3 days, even though time was of critical importance. The early testing effort languished; more victims got infected and died.\n\nInstead of early testing and tracing, what we got instead was mitigation, hurtful political lockdown orders and economic catastrophe. The CDC policy was to act after it was too late.\n\nLewis pounds us with the idea that “beating a pandemic means acting before the danger is clear;” and that requires bureaucratic courage, a trait in short supply.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nOne gauge of prior Michael Lewis books has been the frequency with which my eyes would well up with tears of joy or admiration for some heroic feat, more often than not an intellectual feat. I was not disappointed with this story’s frequency and intensity of heroic flourishes along the pandemic story. It is extraordinary to hear about the exploits of an independent mind; it is quietly satisfying to hear of one independent mind admiring another. That is a unifying thread among the heroes of “The Premonition.”\n\nThe parade of characters here all had sharp minds; they had courage; they were deserving of our admiration. Lewis used his book to pay homage to their contributions.\n\nWhile it was “a hoot” to see the heroes of the story courageously break through a bureaucratic wall in place to keep the boat from being rocked, the breakthroughs happened too late. Instead we got “stay-at-home” orders, government mandated lockdowns.\n\nThe breakthrough should have occurred months earlier with a campaign to test potential victims early, so that contact tracing and isolation could have contained the virus. By delaying decisions so long, containment was no longer an option; the only path left was mitigation. It was under mitigation that over 400,000 American lives were lost.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nI saw Michael Lewis’ book as a refuge from the political battles over the value of “social distancing” and mask wearing. Instead of regarding masks and social distancing as a trip down some rabbit hole, we can instead consider this book’s account of how the disaster was allowed to unfold, of how scientific discoveries do and do not become public policy.\n\nIt has become clear that those who insist upon dismissing masks, vaccines and social distancing measures are those who never delved into the type of thinking that the intellectual giants in this story have embraced as their own normal. There has always been a tendency to rebel against what is not understood.\n\nMichael Lewis paints a frightening picture of us today: we are still woefully uninformed; we still don’t have a grasp of the “big picture;” we still don’t know what to do when the next virus breaks out; the government’s ability to act quickly has still not been developed; the bureaucratic response is still mired in a CYA culture.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nI can’t imagine what the crowd over at CDC must think of this book: it is a cutting indictment of their entire culture; and it puts the blame for America’s ineffective pandemic response right at their doorstep. Ditto for most of the state level CDC departments.\n\nI will be watching with interest to see if any reporter interviews any CDC official, on the record, about the Michael Lewis book; I may be watching for a very long time. I doubt that reporters will even ask; and I have even greater doubts that any CDC official would grace us with an actual assessment.\n\nI was surprised to hear NPR review this book; I had assumed that the theme and the contents would be buried by the MainStreet Media altogether — as they have been solidly supportive of all things CDC since the pandemic first showed up at our shores. The media has not shown much willingness to criticize either the CDC or the FDA; I would expect that to continue.\n\nBut who knows: maybe Michael Lewis will be the catalyst to provoke a fresh look at these once venerable institutions. Lewis continues to be a fine observer of facts on the ground; and he has a nice way of bringing his observations alive.",
    "This is a real historical record of what happened with this Coronavirus and why Lewis thought it happened the way it did up to 2021.\nAfter doing some basic research I determined I purchased this book Aug 2021 after watching a “60 Minutes” program that featured Michael Lewis, the author of this book. He at the time mentioned Charity Dean and I think Richard Hatchett and Carter Meachem and others (nicknamed the Wolverines after the “Red Dawn” movie) who are all major players trying to stop this major disaster in real life.\nI then read roughly half of it and then let it sit for at least 6 months by just working around it and actually ignoring it and the same time acknowledging I really needed to read the rest of the story. It was depressing to me to read.\nFinally I determined that I needed to finish reading the book and have done so.\nAnd but for the grace of God we have survived so far this Coronavirus, but not because these players did NOT do everything they could do to assist us the people to survive but because 99% of the main players that could control the Coronavirus did absolutely nothing and in actual fact hindered their assistance and help to control this virus.\nLewis ends the book by declaring that Charity Dean is starting a real commercial company to make a profit and maybe if at all possible at the same time save the world. Charity has finally determined that the only way to get the attention she needed was to make it cost. And the more it costs the more attention and credibility she will get to help control the next Pandemic. And there will be another, probably sooner rather than 100 years from now like the “Spanish Flu”. And it could very well be this same Coronavirus, just mutated.\nShe is doing this because if she doesn’t no one else will. Which possibly means that the human world will end up as the best case in a new “middle ages” or at the worst extinct. The ones in the middle are to scary to even imagine. Hopefully with her help and others like the Wolverines we can survive.\nI realize that this is probably not a fair review.\nBut other readers must determine what they think of the book and review what they think of it. I really don’t think I’m to far off my opinion of this book.\nThis whole mess is scary!\n\nAnd just so you know Michael Lewis also wrote among many others “The Blind Side & Moneyball”.\nThis author is amazing!",
    "The US once led from the front, taking special care to put its citizens first.\n\nThe rest of the world transmits electricity into your home appliances at 220 Volts. The US suffers a tiny bit financially, but delivers it at 110 Volts, which saves lives. The rest of the world chlorinates water. The US does one better, it fluorinates. The rest of the world was happy to suffer lead in its gasoline (and lungs) well into the eighties. The US switched to unleaded as early as 1972. And toward the end of “The Premonition” you learn that as recently as 1976 the US embarked on a mass vaccination program to stop a potential repeat of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic.\n\nWhat you also learn from this book is that there’s nothing left of the lead the US once enjoyed or the ability of its government to improve people’s lives.\n\nThis is the story of the team that, in response to an order from George W Bush, put together the nation’s plan to fight pandemics, only to see Bolton shut it down halfway through the Trump administration, just in time for the US to totally fumble the recent Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the way that only Michael Lewis can, you are introduced to Bob Glass, Charity Dean, Carter Melcher, Richard Hatchett and Joe DeRisi and follow them as they take it upon themselves to rescue America in this most recent challenge.\n\nIf you read the papers, you know they failed. Here you get to see why: the institutions that would once have taken charge are shown to now be ossified facsimiles of their former selves, mainly focused on avoiding blame, preserving the status quo and suppressing the efforts of any potential usurper.\n\nJust as depressingly, from my angle, the only institutions that come out well from this are the ones funded privately by billionaires and millionaires.\n\nI finished this today, August 21st, with the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in the news and I can’t say I’m surprised.",
    "COVID-19 corona virus has spawned innumerable stories all across the world. Michael Thomas tells a riveting one about seven doctors known as ‘The Wolverines’, led by Carter Mecher, an internist at a Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in Chicago. The 21st century coronavirus pandemic brought these seven together as it brought them to Charity Dean, another doctor, who had taken a low paying job as the head of the Health Authority in Santa Barbera.\n\nLewis is a talented and experienced writer who knows how to inject excitement into all the stories he has written. COVID-19 is not just a pandemic, it has proven to be on scale, worse than the Spanish Flu of 1918. Lewis uses his characters to track how the virus surfaced in China and how it spread to the USA, unnoticed by some and ignored by others.\n\nBut this band of Wolverines was recruited like the Magnificent Seven under Chris Adams (the 1960 John Sturges movie). Chris Adams had it easy, he only had to deal with a band of Mexican bandits. Carter and the Wolverines had to figure out how to stop a deadly virus from spreading across the country, and at the same time, they had to fight his own administrators (this was in the time of President Trump).\n\nLike all wars, the stories of resistance have the greatest heroics. In this story, Charity Dean was brought in touch with the Wolverines by Duane Caneva who Charity initially thought was a Trump storm trooper, but she soon realised that he was part of the resistance. Together, they had to understand the enemy, how it fanned out, and how to find it. In the course of this, they realised that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (‘CDC’) was not up to the task.\n\nThis story of COVID-19 hunters and the weapons and tactics they employ will one day tie in with other stories of the Pandemic of 2020, and one can only hope that it will be The Pandemic Story – With a Happy Ending.",
    "The author takes complicated subjects and explains them in ways normal people can understand. In thus case he shows us how a group of people anticipated a major pandemic and planned for it. He also shows us why things didn't work out as planned.\n\nFrom venal politicians to a broken public health system to corporate desire for profit over service, we see why the pandemic took hold in, supposedly, the earliest most advanced country.\n\nThus should be required reading for all. The lesson is that we need to prepare now for the next one. No one knows when it could happen but we know it will. We can't repeat the mistakes again.",
    "Michael Lewis has written the most interesting book showing how individuals who wish to do a public good with no interest in either politics or profits can be destroyed by the immovable monolith called Government and the buck passing, back watching people who make it fail. Whilst the pandemic may not have been stoppable, had the interventions described by the pandemic plan been implemented not only in the USA but the World, the death rate and misery would have been seriously reduced, for this the CDC, WHO and not only the US Government but all World Governments who took their lead from the CDC and WHO should hang their heads in shame. It would be unfair to single out Trump, but as the “Leader” of the Free World, had he shown one iota of intelligence, knowing and having access to the reports, he should have reacted more aggressively to get on top of the pandemic, but like Boris Johnson in the U.K., he dithered, he stalled, he played down the pandemic as nothing more than influenza on steroids - the World can only surmise the source of the virus, it certainly looks to have been created via Gain of Function research, but what the World is certain of - the failure to plan and take action has led to a death toll that is still rising, and not only because of C-19 but because medical services treating existing or new medical conditions have been diverted to treat C-19 patients causing a treatment backlog. Thank you Michael Lewis and all the brilliant people mentioned who tried and continue to try to get the message across - this book has been a revelation.",
    "This is not the first book by Michael Lewis I’ve read but it may be the best. It shows through personal stories how the US government, like most governments in the West have failed their people. It tells us that experts often do know their stuff and perhaps we should listen when they say there is a problem."

    "This has to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time. As an administrative leader in education, going through Covid, it was extremely difficult. Many teachers didn’t want to come back to school and the ones that did return were faced with students that had been out of school for a while who also had a hard time returning to a brick and mortar setting. This book is such an inspiration as it notes how to lead like the shepherd, not only as a shepherd in a field with sheep, but closely parallels the Bible and Jesus Christ being our shepherd.\nThis would be a great read for leaders of any kind, as well as people in general on how to treat others and approach others in multiple situation.

    "I have read several of John Maxwell’s books on leadership and have learned a lot of valuable skills that have helped me in both my business and personal life. Not surprisingly, when assembling a collection of “success” books to give to my son as a gift for his 21st birthday, John Maxwell came to mind. I was having a hard time deciding which book to give my son and then I came across this book. This Daily Reader is AWESOME! Why? Because it incorporates the timeless leadership principles and wisdom from John Maxwell’s many books into a day to day format that allows the reader to put the skills into practice one day at a time! What a perfect answer to my problem! I couldn’t wait to get the book and read through it before I gave it to my son. All I can say is WOW. It is so much better than I had even hoped! The 365 days’ worth of leadership principles and daily action steps in this book are awesome. My son loves it and I can see already that it is helping my son to develop leadership skills and to positively influence people in his life. This book is a definite must have for anyone who loves writings of John Maxwell, and for anyone who wants to make their life better, one day at a time!\n\nThe Maxwell Daily Reader: 365 Days of Insight to Develop the Leader Within You and Influence Those Around You",

It also has references to which of his books that lesson was from, if you want to delve deeper.\nI also love the layout of this book. There is a lesson for every day of the year but what I especially appreciate is the list of topics at the start of each month."

Self-assessment 1.2 is not there; well, the heading is there, but the list of behaviors you are supposed to evaluate and then score is not. This is super annoying because I only realized this once the return window (a measly 7 days) was closed.\n\nUpdate: so, it turns out the assessment in question shows up on an actual Kindle device and even on the phone app, but not on the desktop app. The result is that it was quite a process to screen shot, email myself, and then convert the images to a usable format, print them, complete the assessment, and then scan and email them to myself to upload to our LMS dropbox! I don't even have an actual Kindle anymore... Does anyone?",

    "Powerful and inspiring. Every leader should read this book and apply the powerful lessons it conveys. Now more than ever we need inspirational leaders to make a positive change in organizations and our world.",
    "So, before I bought this book I read a lot of reviews. The fact that it had so many high reviews was the ultimate decision maker for me. I follow Leadership First on LinkedIn and love the content they provide. With that being said, the content of the book itself is great. The concepts were clear, and the ideas were sound. However, I think it really could have done with some serious proofing. Missing or inaccurate punctuation, photos that look like screen shots, and several minor errors throughout disrupted what is in essence a great book. That is why I give it four stars. If it was more thoroughly and professionally proofed, it easily would have been 5 stars. However, the small errors throughout really took something away from the overall appeal. I still recommend the book for any leader, but be advised.",
    "Easy to read, straight forward and I really resonated with what was written. Allowed for self reflection, affirmative and where further growth can happen. Inspiring.",
    "This book was an easy read and has a lot of very good information on leadership and how to develop yourself and others to be leaders",
    "If you are brand new to leadership, or hoping to get into leadership, this is an easy and quick read that introduces many truths about the inspirational leader. If you have a leadership background already, you may be a bit disappointed in the way it is presented as an interesting but very high level overview without a lot of detail. Also, there are so many grammar and punctuation errors that you may find them distracting from the message - I did.",
    "I have given the book one star for the effort of the writer to research the content, albeit not very good. A second star goes to the marketing that lured me into purchasing the book; it's been well advertised and promoted but fails to deliver on its promise. The first thing I noticed were the images that fail to adhere to the original aspect ratio; it's either squashed or stretched for the most part. As for the book's contents, it's all elementary stuff that you could read on any leadership blog; there's very little academic prowess other than referencing random quotes from the internet. I do not recommend this book; you would be better off buying How to Manage by Jo Owen, as it's much more academic and states valuable information that can be cited in studies or real scenarios.",
    "I was really looking forward to reading this after it being highly publicised on LinkedIn. I am so disappointed in the poor quality, there are stretched and skewed images, unfinished sentences and frequent typos throughout. It looks and feels cheap and not at all like the other business type books I’ve purchased.\n\nSome of the content is actually quite inspirational if you can overlook the haste in which this book has been put together.\n\nDisappointing.",

I would like to think that by working on myself it will transfer out the positivity and inner belief to other people that I work with.",

    "I purchased this book for a graduate level course I am taking. It's simple to read, makes sense, has elements of humor, lots of repetition, and great information. Highly recommend for a novice proposal writer and really anyone who needs to refresh on elements of crafting a proposal.",
    "Many small businesses, non-profits, individual researchers, and larger institutions depend on grants to fund their activities and livelihoods. Whether from private foundations or governmental entities, these funds are given through a competitive process. Through market forces, this process seeks to align funders’ desires with projects that achieve results. This book seeks to demystify this process and provide readers with a “leg up” to write better grant proposals.\n\nKarsh and Fox’s work is primarily geared towards writers of socially oriented grants. Its examples include primarily social causes, not basic research. I work in the sciences, and this book does not include many examples of these kind of projects. However, it’s guiding advice and principles certainly can apply to those type of projects, too. I’m just going to have to read another book geared towards scientific grant-writing, too.\n\nI honestly lack the experience to judge the trustworthiness of this Karsh and Fox’s advice. Like many potential readers, I am more in need of insight than able to judge reliability. Nonetheless, the communication style is clear and expressive. Obviously, this book, now in its fifth edition, has gone through many rounds of editing. Its voice is mature, and its points, well-thought-out.\n\nOf special note, the authors have consulted grant givers extensively in the preparation of this book. As such, this book offers useful, practical tips towards garnering a favorable response. They even include several chapters of “roundtable” advice that explore relevant topics. For decades, Karsh was a grant giver in a prior career, and Fox, a grant writer. Their powerful combination produces much insight. Especially for projects aligned for social impact, this book provides a healthy repository of advice that should be consulted before any proposal words are written.",
    "Jam-packed with Advice on Writing Stories into Your Proposal\nIn the fourth edition of The Only Grant Writing Book You’ll Ever Need, I found the authors’ general opinions to be skeptical but realistic. As a PhD student requirement (and useful function to learn) in many doctoral programs, I enrolled in Pepperdine University’s grant writing course. I chose to review this book as a way to familiarize myself with the process. As someone without any background in grants, I found this book to be of great service to me in preparing an applied research proposal for funding. \nMost suggestively, I found it useful to read the Table of Contents first and plan to read over the most relevant sections first (for my uses) before reading the whole book. These included the Appendices 1-4 which I found quite practical, some in list format and sample grant proposals were also provided.\nSignificant aspects of this edition were the meaningful inclusion of purpose and storytelling. Even if you cannot digest or read this entire book, read Lesson 1 (and maybe Lesson 2), and then skip to page 74 on Individual Grant Seekers. Lesson 1 highlights the importance of knowing who you are and why you want a grant. What are you doing in the world? Think big picture. How’s the grant going to help the funder? Why are you unique? What will your project do for humanity? How are you affiliated with the university or organization that is actually receiving the grant? What’re your driving passions?\nIn Lesson 4’s section on Individual Grant Seekers, there is practical information for people who do not intend on setting up a non-profit organization. For students, in particular, this is a must-read component. The authors say that you must prepare the following documents if you’re an individual grant seeker: (1) resume or curriculum vitae, (2) a portfolio, (3) reviews, (4) list of partners or clients.\nAnother useful tip was to write as you speak. There is no need for academic language or big words. Be clear and concise without over using verbiage that will lose your audience. Acronyms and jargon must be avoided.\nOne thing I didn’t like was the pop quiz sections at the end of each lesson. Answers are hidden in the back of the book. I would have preferred simple chapter summaries instead.\nYou can expect easy readability and high applicability of the text with examples throughout. My favorite part was Part 1: Prerequisites. The authors kept a fun and light attitude throughout the book, often using humor to keep me reading further, for example, “[m]y car was totaled; can I get a grant? No” (Fox and Fox,2014).\nI would highly recommend this book to students in a similar position of needing funding for research because there are many useful and concrete lessons I will bring with me to that process, as learned from this book.\n\nKarsh, E., & Fox, A.

That is because the book seemed to break its own guidance on language. Chapter 2 focuses on understanding your readers: they may not have technical understanding. That understanding of language was a major block to me when it came to Appendix B concerning grammatical rules. I regard myself as being a literate person with a reasonably sound knowledge of English grammar. This appendix demonstrated to me that there is a lot of technical language concerning grammar that I do not understand. Some examples are: \"appositive\",\"correlative conjunctions\", and \"illusory compounds\". To be fair to the author, the terms are defined, but for me the flow of the book dried up at this point.

    "Great gift for a graduation present",
    "My goodness, have I got a lot to say about this book! First off, I just finished it, I've never read anything so fast in my entire life. Me and my husband have been struggling, struggling so fiercely, day in and day out. I have so many books that I've read, I usually have 2 books on me at any given time trying to figure out what I need to do z how do I need to think, how do I keep myself from thinking so negatively, how do I get over my social anxiety, how how how! I've been so exhausted trying to do this.... On My Own. I never stopped to think that doing this on my/our own never works! It can't, there are too many things that you have to remember, and it's just a constant FIGHT!.. a fight I'll never win, and I'll never have to. Whoever this author is... Thank you! Thank God for you!!! I am a Christ follower, and I never understood things the way he explained them. I never knew following God was like this. You helped me, you helped my husband. And because of you, you're gonna help so many others because this is the only path I will take from NOW ON! Thank you!",
    "The Garden was a quick read the first time. Now the book study begins to capture all that Jon has in the book. The quote, \"To answer your questions of why Adam and Even were given a choice in the first place, they had to be given a choice. God had to create space for them to choose Him.\" is a great message to so many that ponder \"free will and choice\". The Carpenter and now The Garden are a critical part of my use in helping people in their personal struggles that deal with being successful in work and in life purpose. The Garden speaks to so many people. It is a great attractor but the value of the information is overpowering. Every Sunday School Class should use this at every age to have a great discussion. Every parent should give their child a copy to read\n\nJon’s ability to take complex material and put into a simplistic read is one of his greatest gifts. The reader needs to sit and read and then go back and reread with study to get the so many messages within it. Thanks John. Did it again.",
    "This is the first Jon Gordon book to come with a warning, so I knew it was going to be different. This is definitely not like his other books. Yes, it’s a fable, so it’s a quick read that can be applied to many different aspects of life (school, work, family, etc.). But make no mistake, this is a faith-based book.\n\nWhat most people don’t realize is that we’re in a war, day in and day out. Whether it’s things that happen to us, things we think and say; it’s all part of a battle.\n\nThe enemy we face, yet cannot see, has a playbook. In “The Garden”, Jon reveals the enemy’s primary tactics (the 5 D’s) and how we can recognize and overcome them.\n\nI strongly believe that this book should be in all our arsenals. The lessons contained in this book can be taught by parents to children at a young age so they’re better prepared as they get older. I believe that mature middle school students and high school students will benefit immensely from the lessons in this book as they face fear, anxiety and stress like never before.",
    "I just finished the book and I loved it! Definitely different than Jon’s other books because it isn’t related to business but at the same time very similar because of his amazing ability to teach through story telling. So easy and quick to read, you can’t put it down. I think it is one of the best descriptions of free will that I have heard and I love how it describes the fact that there is an enemy lurking all of the time to steal our minds and make us doubt and head down the path of the five D’s (doubt, distortion, discouragement, distractions, and division) and make bad choices. It is so powerful to hear that those thoughts aren’t ours, and that we would never do that to ourselves and to recognize that it takes a constant focus on God and what he says about us to keep them away. The descriptions and examples bring to life what freedom in Jesus feels like. Such a beautiful book and so needed for our world right now. 🙏❤️",
    "This was a reminder of the how the 5D's can ruin you unless you remember, that destiny is the end game. Jeremiah 29:11... God definitely has a plan for each of us. Thanks Jon!",
    "My mistake - I was hoping that a business and leadership guru would have some practical guidance for the issues today's teens face.\n\nHe has an answer, in the sense that he believes all answers lie in faith. So if Jesus is your thing, this book's for you; if it isn't, buy something else.",
    "This book is different to Jon Gordon's other books which he is very clear to state from the outset however it is very relevant for the times we are going through. The narrative of this spiritual fable is very well-articulated and cleverly written. It was refreshing to read this book, definitely food for the soul, tapping into very real and current struggles of everyday life, adversity, trials and tribulations, human emotions, fulfilment, challenges and opportunities, happiness and contentment.\n\nOnce you pick this book up to read you will not be able to put it down until you finish. It's a very easy read book and the analogies used are in a very simplistic form to understand but have such a profound and powerful meaning.",
    "Wise reflections to support young people on an often tough life journey",
    "What an inspiring book, so easy to read yet so transformative. Reminded me so forcefully of my true identity and how to overcome my fears and doubts. it is changing my life just as the God that inspired it does every day.",

    "Sometime late in the 1980s, I was speaking with the CEO of a major Fortune 500 company. The conversation turned to the stock market and how poor a guide it was to the country’s economic health. He pointed to General Electric and its CEO, Jack Welch. The company had consistently been posting 15 percent annual increases in net profits, quarter after quarter. “Jack Welch,” he said, “is cooking the books. There is absolutely no way any company GE’s size could honestly be turning in such rosy results every quarter for years on end, through all the economy’s ups and downs.”\n\nThis misleading pattern was the result of the misguided policy of putting shareholders first, he explained. Now, more than three decades later, I understand exactly what Jack Welch was doing to pull that off. It’s the dominant theme in New York Times business journalist David Gelles’ eye-opening biography, The Man Who Broke Capitalism.\n\nHOW JACK WELCH DESTROYED GE BY PUTTING SHAREHOLDERS FIRST\nWhen Welch took charge of General Electric as Chief Executive Officer in 1981, he immediately proceeded to set aside the strategy that had made the company one of the world’s most successful and admired business enterprises. “During his tenure, GE posted annualized share price growth of about 21 percent a year,” Gelles notes. But the way he achieved that growth was catastrophic. The policies he put in place—policies faithfully pursued by his chosen successor—nearly drove the firm into bankruptcy.\n\n“At its nadir,” Gelles writes, “GE needed a $139 billion rescue from the Obama administration and an eleventh-hour investment from Warren Buffett to stave off collapse.” Eventually, the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average as one of the nation’s bellwether businesses. In 2021, what was left of GE was broken into three smaller companies. And the policies Jack Welch pursued—downsizing, dealmaking, and financialization—became the hallmarks of Big Business in America, as CEOs throughout the land rushed to mimic the man Fortune called “The Manager of the Century.”\n\nTHE AVATAR OF SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY\nA decade before Welch was named CEO, University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman had gained fame by insisting that the true purpose of any business was to make money for its shareholders. He dismissed talk of “the social responsibility of business” as “taxation without representation” for shareholders. Throughout the 1970s, other conservative economists and business school professors built on Friedman’s thesis. Putting shareholders first became a byword in conservative business circles. But in 1981 few if any large US corporations had put policies in place consistent with Friedman’s mandate. Jack Welch changed all that. He became the poster boy for shareholder primacy in the 1980s. And that misguided doctrine has dominated Big Business in America for the past four decades.\n\nDOWNSIZING, DEALMAKING, AND FINANCIALIZATION\nJack Welch gained the nickname “Neutron Jack” during the first four years of his tenure, when he divested 117 business units and slashed more than a quarter of the company’s jobs. But he continued to earn the reputation for the “rank and yank” policy he imposed on GE throughout his time as CEO. This was the practice of firing the 10 percent of employees who received the lowest annual performance reviews. And, in the process, Welch slashed funding for research and development, stifling the company’s well-earned plaudits for a century of innovation. After all, GE was the company of Thomas Edison. He also moved aggressively to spend billions of dollars buying back the stock, year after year, all in the interest of delivering value to shareholders. But, more broadly, Gelles views Welch’s strategy for GE as resting on three pillars.\n\nDOWNSIZING\n“For generations,” Gelles notes, “it was generally true that once you got a job at a company like GE you could keep it until you retired.” In fact, Big Business, and the US economy as a whole, had prospered for decades grounded in this understanding. But “this was blasphemy to Welch.” The ink was barely dry on his employment contract when he launched a series of mass layoffs that shattered morale in the company’s workforce and set a pattern followed by other large corporations in the decades ahead. The jobs moved to new plants overseas, or to suppliers that were often overseas themselves, or simply disappeared. When Welch became CEO in 1981, GE employed some 400,000 workers. When he retired in 2001, the head count was down to 300,000 even after acquiring hundreds of companies during his 20 years at the helm.\n\nDEALMAKING\nTo meet Welch’s arbitrary profit targets, he and the men he commanded turned to acquisitions to fatten GE’s revenues and meet Wall Street’s rosy expectations. They spent $130 billion acquiring nearly 1,000 companies (including RCA and NBC). Many of these companies later proved to be hugely unprofitable—but they’d served their function by adding to the short-term bottom line. Which was entirely consistent with the commitment to put shareholders first. They’d also converted General Electric from a manufacturing company into a conglomerate dominated by its financial division, a massive unregulated bank called GE Capital.\n\nFINANCIALIZATION\nGE Capital was the centerpiece of Jack Welch’s strategy for the company. At the outset in 1981, the unit was a tiny operation that backstopped the company’s manufacturing businesses by financing customers’ purchases of GE appliances. Under Welch, GE Capital became the tail that wagged the dog, growing into a colossus with $370 billion in assets and “ultimately accounting for 40 percent of revenues and 60 percent of profits.” With worldwide operations, the unit grew into a multibillion-dollar bank that loaned money to retail customers and businesses alike from Romania to the Philippines.\n\n“Thanks to the sprawling finance division,” Gelles writes, “[Welch] could produce ‘earnings on demand,’ as one analyst put it at the time . . . [I]n the last days of each quarter, GE Capital would often unleash a flurry of activity, adding profits and taking restructuring charges as needed to help the parent company meet Wall Street’s expectations.” At times, Welch went even further. “It even took to reporting growth in its pension fund’s investment portfolio as income.” All because Jack Welch had swallowed whole Milton Friedman’s theory that business operated best by putting shareholders first.\n\nAN ICON FOR TWO GENERATIONS OF CORPORATE MANAGERS\nThroughout, Gelles emphasizes Welch’s far-ranging influence on the American economy as a whole. During his 20 years running GE, he was lionized in the press and regarded as a hero by millions. His impact on Big Business was immense. Welch trained hundreds of senior executives, and many of those “executives went on to lead dozens of other major companies—including Boeing, 3M, Honeywell, Chrysler, Home Depot, Albertsons, and many more—where they seeded new clusters, spreading Welchism across the whole of corporate America.” And we live today paying the steep price of that legacy.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nThe bio on David Gelles‘s author website reads in part: “David is a reporter for the Climate desk and the Corner Office columnist for the New York Times. At the Times, he previously covered mergers and acquisitions for DealBook. Before joining the Times in 2013, he spent five years with the Financial Times. At the FT, he covered tech, media and M&A in San Francisco and New York. In 2011 he conducted an exclusive jailhouse interview with Bernie Madoff, shedding new light on the $65 billion ponzi scheme. He lives in New York City with his family.”",
    "One good thing about being stuck in Covid quarantine (mild case: 3 days of fever but no other symptoms for the last 5 days), is that I got to read this book. I think it is hugely important and makes a compelling, if depressingly realistic, case for how corporate profit-first ideology has badly damaged American democracy.\n\nI’m a fan of David Gelles, who writes for the Times about corporate malfeasance. I’ve also been interested in Jack Welch since I read an article in Fortune magazine about how a speech he gave in 2001 was responsible for kicking off the Shareholder Value movement.\n\nThis was the push to give stockholders immediate higher returns on investment and made growth in profits the sole corporate goal (a big shift from blue chip stocks like IBM, which promised slow but steady returns over a long time period).\n\nGelles explains what this did to corporations and what they then did to America. Companies like Welch’s General Electric, which made toasters and household electrics, fired employees, outsourced labor, cut all possible costs, merged and acquired, manipulated earnings, and forgot about ethics let alone social responsibility. Boeing, infamously, did the same. Hence plane crasshes and deaths.\n\nOther results: destruction of the environment, loss of manufacturing, and the evaporation of decent working- and middle class incomes and the transfer of their wealth to stockholders and especially to corporate executives. Hence their obscene salaries and compensation.\n\nGelles also describes the widespread acceptance of profits first, the ignoring of its consequences, and the collusion of Wall Street and the government in this destructive system.\n\nFood companies are no exception. I have long attributed the push to sell ultraprocessed junk food—regardless of its health consequences—as a result of what Jack Welch started.\n\nInterestingly, Gelles cites a food company, Unilever, as an example of a corporation that is trying to put social values back in the picture.\n\nHe says others should follow Unilever’s example, and cites the 2019 statements by the World Economic Forum and the Business Roundtable to suggest that maybe business is finally catching on to the need for change. (See my incredulous post on these statements)\n\nI think he may be too optimistic. As he admits on page 223, this is what actually happened during the pandemic:\n\nOne study showed that companies that signed the Business Roundtable statement were actually more likely to announce layoffs in the first months of the pandemic than companies that didn’t sign the statement, and that the companies that pledged to serve all stakeholders actually distributed more of their profits to shareholders than those who didn’t publicly pledge to look out for the common good.\n\nSo much for promises.\n\nAs a Lancet Commission said early in 2019, if we want social values to matter in business, government is going to have to start regulating. For that to happen, we need much greater demand from civil society.\n\nThis book makes a strong case for the need to change the way corporations operate. Let’s get to work.",
    "Anybody with morals will find this a difficult read because the author bares the soul of everything that is bad & self-destructive about business attitudes & methods that were THE Bible in the 1980s, 1990s & are still prevalent today (Bezos, Musk).\n\nAlthough he focuses on the US landscape, the same model has systematically destroyed communities, economies & the fabric of society at large, wherever it has been adopted.\n\nGelles provides important insight on how narcissistic toxicity, the focus on 'me,' destroys the power of 'we.'\n\nIn short, he systematically dismantles 'Welchism,'the dysfunctional business model that puts profits before people, relegating those who create the success to numbers & steps in a process that benefits shareholders & fat cat CEOs, the same model that focuses on short-term gain at any cost whilst stripping-out the resources to sustain company health & longevity: its people & their skills.\n\n'The Man Who Broke Capitalism' catalogues how once highly successful & healthy companies, like GE, Honeywell, Intuit, Symantec, Ford, Boeing, Home Depot & 3M, were stripped of their soul, success & purpose by short-sighted bullies who milked them for everything they could, walking away with tens of millions in payoffs & with zero responsibility for their actions. I was part of a corporation infected by the cancer of a 'Welch disciple' & witnessed first-hand how quickly great companies lose their way & sense of worth under the toxicity of their leader's ideology.\n\nThankfully, some like Intuit, 3M & Ford saw the tumour growing & managed to cut it out before the company died. There are signs that businesses are beginning to wake up, but for many, like GE, the damage is irreparable & they must start from ground zero. Welchism & the teachings of psychologist Milton Friedman still reign supreme in many quarters today. Where it does, their future is a ticking time-bomb.\n\nI found the book hard to put down & wanted to read more when I came to the end.\n\nA great read.",

    "With a strong yearning to lead transformational workshops myself, I found myself scanning book titles on Amazon trying to see if there is any suitable read out there that will help me identify the key components of transformational workshops and help me understand the difference between a conventional style workshop and what I am after which is more in line with affecting positive and lasting change in others' lives. Bingo. Found this book and have read about half of it twice. (Life is very busy for me and my reading gets been interrupted). That said, the content is so good, I find myself being a slow reader as it is chock-full of great information and insights only obtainable through a group of individuals who have walk the path of leading hundreds of these types of workshops. I am incredibly grateful that they took the time to produce this book and when I can manage, I intend on going to their in-person facilitator training workshops.",
    "I’ve studied with the authors and read this book cover to cover four times. It’s pure gold. When I applied what I learned in the book, my workshops and retreats went to the next level (actually my programs jumped several levels). It’s specific, detailed, and surprising. There were so many things I didn’t realize were hindering my effectiveness. This book is unique and truly inspirational. I love the examples of what went wrong and what to do about it. I have witnessed deep transformation in my clients because of what I implemented from this book. Get out your highlighter and dive in! You won’t regret it.",
    "Say goodbye to the voice of insecurities and fears regarding your leadership, teaching, and intervention skills. Say hello to a complete, digestible structure of mind-set, humanity, and science that will become your new home for your Self in your work (and even life)! Simply to read this spectacular book is to change already your relationship with your inner, genuine Self. You will imagine, with every page, how you will become the workshop/retreat/ training leader that your desires and longings say you can be. You can enjoy your personal calling in all the fullness of experience that you are imagining. This comprehensive book is the be-all, end-all book for “training the trainers.” It is the KEY to unlock so many doors that have been rusted shut from feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, or often, just lack of information!\n\nAs a psychotherapist of some 40 yrs, I know the power of what is in this revelatory book. I have attended the workshop led by Ken, Lesli, and Jim (authors). They are vastly experienced, articulate, loving, wise, and very human. They embody and model everything they teach. They want you to succeed and know how to help you do just that. And if you ever get the chance to attend this workshop at Kripalu (magical place!), it just may be the most impacting gift you will ever give yourself---in addition to this phenomenal book.\n\nI have done a fair amount of training/workshops in my career. All went seemimgly ok, and all involved, for me, more than just performance-anxiety as well as often extreme over-stimulation, making it hard to decompress afterwards and sleep the night before and after. After my workshop experience at Kripalu, and using the workshop manual, I created many 3 hr. workshops (original content by me) that I had been envisioning. My personal experience of doing these workshops was the most calm, assured, anxiety-free enjoyment I have ever had, and it was so long in coming! I also designed and led a 5-day training in the therapy model I use. They were all successful and “masterfully done” was a repeated written review. And anything I can do, you can do better!!! If you consider yourself a change agent in any way in our world, don’t live the rest of your professional and personal life without this book by your side.",
    "I had the great luck to participate in Ken Nelson and Lesli Lang’s course at Kripalu a number of years ago so when I heard about this book I was delighted. I was also deeply curious.\n\nWhy delighted? Their course was so informative, comprehensive and high quality I wanted people who could not make the trip to the Berkshires to nonetheless have the benefit of their experience. In that regard, this book is a winner.\n\nWhy deeply curious? I wondered whether they could translate such skill and depth of heart onto the printed page. ‘Modeling’ the best way to lead a workshop, in person during a workshop, is one thing; could they ‘show up’ on the printed page as well? In fact, they did. This book ‘transmits.’ Though not in the same room, you’ll meet these authors as the authentic, honest, wise people they are. Just like those of us in the workshops knew we were in good hands, as you read, you’ll sense that, too.\n\nEven better, unlike a weekend workshop, reading this book is like having a private tutorial with people who are the masters of their craft for as long as you care to keep at it and as often as you'd care to come back to is.\n\nAs one who’s taken their workshop, I’m deeply grateful they chose to write this book. It is far more comprehensive than any weekend could offer. In addition, they’ve improved a set of materials we received at the workshop. Those materials are now far more comprehensive and provide any workshop leader with a running head start on every phase of planning and execution.\n\nI’ll never lead a workshop as well as they do. In fact, given the current pandemic state of the world, it will be a long time before I ever lead a workshop again.\n\nIn the meantime, this book has given me a framework for thinking about how to improve other types of interactions with people in my work. Whether it’s an email, a Zoom meeting or a phone call, these authors have provided me with an approach to leadership that is transferable to those encounters, too. With luck, if I’ve learned their lessons well enough, even a Zoom meeting might well be transformational.",
    "Better than expected",
    "I’ve been looking for this book for years.\nThis type of book often talks ABOUT the topic.\nThis is a guide, insightful, instructive and easy to use. It is book is a terrific guide & manual.\nWell written & user friendly.",
    "Even for those of us whose workshop topics are perhaps more pragmatic than \"life-changing\", the book offers a wealth of tips and tools for creating a more immersive experience for our participants. While it's certainly possible to read it from cover to cover, it's organized in such a way that readers can access what they need, when they need it. It is thoroughly researched, and those of us with an academic bent can find proper references (which is, sadly, not always the case with non-peer-reviewed literature). The table of contents is well structured and it is easy to find prompts, lists, suggestions, and food for thought about every aspect of your workshop.\n\nAs a former executive and part time academic, I have more \"presentations\" under my belt than I can count. This book was just what I needed to start transforming those into engaging and transformative experiences.",
    "Reading this book was a wonderful reminder of my own experience and all the gifts I have received participating in transformational workshops led by Ken and his colleagues!\nWritten with grace, respect and inspiration - this is a treasure of knowledge, an incredibly generous practical\nstep-by-step guide to support growth, leadership and creation!\nA MUST READ!!!",
    "This is a very useful book that leads you through the group creation, development and facilitation process. A great tool for beginners and more experienced group leaders."

    "I would call this book a \"first step\" toward \"financial intelligence \". If your looking for a \"step by step instruction manual\" on how to \"legally cheat your taxes\", or any other \"step by step\" for that matter, this book is NOT it. I would look at this book as more of a \"list\" of financial possibilities to be aware of, and to consider learning more about. And written in a way to inspire one to go off and learn more about how money works! Dont get me wrong. This book is very informative and worth every penny I spent on it! I'm just letting you know, its not a \"step by step, \"how to\" guide\". Its more of a \"what you need to educate yourself more on, in order to be successful\".",
    "If you want practical insight that can help your future decision making process better when it comes to assets and liabilities, then this book will help. Robert has a great way of communicating his philosophy to help us all get out of the rat race.",
    "Your home is a liability.\n\nSounds crazy to most people, but when you think about it - especially in the simplified way the author presents it - it's true. Investments being money in, while liabilities cost us money, and that house is draining hundreds or thousands out of your pocket every month. Knowing this difference is what differentiates the rich from the poor and struggling middle.\n\nKiyosaki doesn't go into great detail about the ins and outs of how to get started with that first investment, but he does provide a good overview, so you at least have an idea of what you don't know and where to go from here. He also provides a list of more actionable items anyone can start employing immediately, before even making that first investment.\n\nThe book, itself, is an easy read. I got done with it in 4-5 hours, and I'm a slow reader. However, it has quite a bit of great information, some of which was no-doubt lost on me this first time around. I fully plan to come back to this book and read it again after I've put some of the actionable items into play.\n\nThe biggest thing I didn't care for was that a good chunk of the middle was spent talking in abstract terms about real estate investing, and for a time, it felt like that was his only recommended source of income. I would have loved to see him touch a little more on the other alternative forms of income in this section. I also would have loved to see more stories about his childhood in this section, as those seemed to abruptly stop partway through.\n\nFinally, I will say this: to fully understand the purpose and message of this book, you need to be ready to set aside what you think you know. You need to be ready to at least consider turning conventional wisdom and everything you learned on its head. Sit back and think about the decisions he describes and dig into the whys behind them. Don't let knee-jerk disagreement get in the way. If you think his statement that a person's house is a liability is contradictory to his later talk about investing in real estate, then you need to think more about the differences between the two and how the earlier description of assets versus liabilities applies.",
    "This is a hard book to rate as there is undeniably some real meat to this, but it's only to be found by wading through a lot of repetition. I really felt like this could've been a 20 page pamphlet and been just as educational, but clearly, after reading this book, Kiyosaki's plans to pad his retirement include writing books with a handful of good ideas, reword them a bajillion times (and even repeat sentences verbatim frequently), add some fluff and sit back and watch the money roll in. I can only imagine that his seminars probably amount to the same.\n\nHowever... that being said, I mustered the patience necessary, ignored the repetition and horrible writing to push through to the end, and I found myself inspired by this book. While nothing sophisticated or seemingly profound, it does spark that paradigm change to get the gears turning and I think that was all he was really going for. (Other than creating another form of passive income for himself, of course.)\n\nBut be warned, there are no real specifics to be found here, and again, there needn't be any. I think the most important take-away of this book is that you will never escape the Rat Race expecting your income to outmatch your expenses; it is necessary to find the means to generate passive income. As for the hows on a lot of the suggestions here.... you're on your own. But I don't rate the book lower for not including them. As I said, I believe the intent is to simply make that paradig shift in the reader's mind and let them figure out the hows on their own.\n\nI would probably rate this a 3.5 if I could, very tempted to rate it a 3 simply because I felt like the writing style was awful. But... as I believe it accomplishes what it was intended to, it inspired me to push forward in my own enterprise and I could honestly say I'd recommend this book to someone else (with a warning about all the fluff) in need of that paradigm change, I'll be generous and give it a 4 (but just barely).",
    "While I'll admit this book does have some great insight into how money works, where it comes from, the differences between the rich and the middle class, assets and liabilities etc... this book is a preach on the idea of real estate which is an extremely expensive scheme to enter into, and not ideal if you're starting from the bottom. So what actually made the author rich? Real estate? Or is that now keeping him rich after selling this best-selling book preaching these financial methods which are either extremely expensive or take a lifetime to accumulate (stock investments for example)? A book I'd recommend over this one any day would be \"The Millionaire Fastlane\" by MJ DeMarco. It has tried and tested methods for anyone who wants to make a lot of money in a much shorter space of time, even if you're starting from ground zero. And also, the author practices what he preaches!",
    "The book is presented as a true story which it isn't. Although this is fine, the author tries way too hard to convince the reader. Whilst they are good, albeit simple principles, they do manage to drive home the point.\n\nClaims that he was forging coins pouring molten metal on his driveway at 11 year old however made alarm bells ring and my suspicions continued through the book, which marred the overall experience. Above all, the two Dads (or at least one!), don't exist. It's just a fabrication to convey a point.",
    "This book succeeded in its goal I think: to impress on me (ie, the reader in general) the value of being financially literate. And also to impress on the reader the almost universality of financial illiteracy.\n\nThe writing is blatant and unapologetic, and all the more illuminating for it. Here’s one fabulous quotation:\n\nWhen the supermarket has a sale, say on toilet paper, the consumer runs in and stocks up. But when the housing or stock market has a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the same consumer often runs away from it.\n\nKiyosaki writes excellently, and the book is short, but it would still have been better to be about half the length it is: the first 7 chapters are really good fun, telling the story of how two small boys (one of whom is Kiyosaki) are groomed by Mike’s (the other small boy) dad in the ways of business.The remaining chapters are much drier, formulaic checklists, which look good to dip in and out of as the need/interest arises, but are not particularly fun to read straight through.\n\nDefinitely worth the read though. Take home message: you create value in your life. Do you want that value for yourself, your family and those you choose, or do you want to surrender the majority of it to some distant employer or government?\n\nNot covered in Kiyosaki’s book is any mention of ethics. He does not deal at all satisfactorily with the impression that his success (and the success of very many of the rich) is based off the suffering, ignorance and foolishness of others (it seems a large proportion of his wealth is related to foreclosure business, and dodgy training courses for the bright eyed but dim witted).\n\nSo although I disagree with his (sadly absent) ethical stance, it seems there is a lot to learn from his ideas (essentially, deprogramming ubiquitous and counterproductive cultural assumptions around surrendering ones value creation to (frankly, undeserving) third parties, be they corporate or governmental), and I think there is almost certainly a very good ethical grounding behind wanting to promote financial literacy in the world at large.\n\nPerhaps he thinks it is okay to benefit from those who are not yet financially literate, by teaching them financial literacy as hard as possible. Sounds reasonable! With caveats and in theory, if perhaps not in practice :)\n\nVery interesting read anyway. Once again, I am reminded of five of Kahlil Gibran’s timeless words:\n\nWork is love made visible.\n\nKiyosaki definitely provides some practical inspiration for that.\n\n(Also, thank you Guy for telling me about this book! :)\n\n(taken from my blog here: [...]",
    "A great book to read as a first read. Unfortunately, I started with Robert's second book Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money. This book is basically the same but it describes his Robert's youth. I found the second one to be much for elaborate and interesting, to the point. To my greatest sadness I think this book is very slow at explaining the point, it is repetitive and hard to read because it gets boring after a while. Maybe it;s my mistake to have read the second version first but I would still recommend for parents or just for general knowledge. Robert does have amazing point to consider on how to raise children.",
    "The descriptions didn't specify measurements for the miniature book so I am very unsatisfied with the size. As for the content of the book, it felt like just a brief summary that I finished reading in 15 minutes. It's easily legible however with brief, short diagrams so that you just get an idea if you are completely new into the game. There was barely any content and the main topic was just talking about the difference between a liability and an asset so I didn't feel like I gained the knowledge I was expecting. I like Robert Kiyosaki and I needed to learn more about marketing by buying this book but this miniature one underestimates his book and doesn't offer any in-depth knowledge at all."

    "This book lays out a simple plan to address the climate crisis and shows how we would go about achieving it. I enjoyed the many stories and interviews and overall feel inspired to do more for our planet!",
    "Breaks down the core components of climate change and gives stories about large and small solutions being done. Fantastic overview of the crisis ahead of us in a very readable format. Have purchased several copies for colleagues interested in the topic.",
    "I did not read the whole book, just did word searches to see what it said about nuclear energy.\n\nJohn Doerr is a billionaire high tech venture capitalist philanthropist how just donated billions of dollars to set up a new school dedicated to solving climate change.\n\nI was suspicious, because Stanford is home to prof Mark Z. Jacobson, who claims to have it all figured out -- how we can transition to zero carbon in time with existing technology using very little other than wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro. A lot of people feel that his plan is optimistic and unrealistic. Jacobson despises nuclear energy.\n\nSo I got the book to see if it gives nuclear a fair chance.\n\nIn the prologue and intro, wind & solar were really taking center stage without nuclear being mentioned.\nI did some word searches.\n\nThe word \"thorium\" is never mentioned anywhere in the book.\n\n\"Nuclear\" comes up, and this guy isn't as hostile to it as Mark Z. Jacobson, but boy, is he ignorant.\n\nHe's says that fuel for fission is limited, which means he's never heard of getting uranium from sea water, from which enough can be extracted to power humanity for billions of years until the sun explodes. Of course, he doesn't mention that land-based thorium is more plentiful than land-based uranium.\n\nHe never mentions meltdown-proof next-generation reactors, or the fact that they would require radically less micro-regulation that our current-generation huge light-water reactors, which could radically reduce costs and construction time.\n\nHe says nuclear plants take a long time to build, no mention of the fast rollout of nuclear energy in France, or that fact that the US just sucks at building ANYTHING big. It costs 6 times as much to build a mile of subway in NYC as it does in Europe. China built themselves a whole network of bullet trains in a short time, and all we have is Acela, a half-bullet train, on one track, the northeastern corridor. Probably has something to do with our politicians have law degrees and Chinese politicians have engineering degrees.\n\nHe never mentions speeding up reactor construction by building small modular reactors on assembly lines, or building reactors on barges in shipyards.\n\nA better book is \"A Bright Future: How Some Countries Have Solved Climate Change and the Rest Can Follow\" by Joshua S. Goldstein\n\nconservativeclimateactivists dot com",
    "Change happens very slowly - and then all at once. Our climate crises is like car wreck in slow motion. It's not like this is new news. James Hansen from @NASA briefed Congress in 1988. It can't be easy to be a climate scientist. Some are so tired of science based arguments that they started locking their bodies to a White House fence. I don't expect most of these scientists are radical, but hellloooo world we have a problem. So enough doom and gloom - John Doerr breaks it down and offers a plan and a budget to remove 59 gigatons of carbon which enough to prevent catastrophic temperature rise. Not easy, but seem very doable if we have the will. Sure, I drive an EV and have PV panels on my roof, but progress is just too slow and narrow. The message of Speed and Scale resonates with me. Finally a positive message - read it - take hope, take action.",
    "This book should be a must read for anyone who cares about climate change. The issue with climate change is that the problem is so huge and mind boggling that people shy away from action. John doesn’t try to minimize the problem but presents a metrics driven actionable plan that can spur governments, companies and individuals to action. My only regret is that why John didn’t write this book earlier. Everyone needs to read, share with others, pick a cause and drive action to save the life on this beautiful planet.",
    "As a baby boomer raised post WWII, I grew up in the best of times not really knowing the consequences of the lifestyle that everyone shared. We thought nothing of driving long distances just to have lunch or to just go sightseeing. But now we are seeing the impact of unregulated and unbridled economic development. Our planet is telling us in no uncertain terms that we can not continue to ignore the impact that our consumer based economies have on the future of the planet as a whole and on the quality of life for our children and for future generations. The time is now. This is serious and we have little time left to save ourselves and our children’s children. Time to roll up our sleeves and get to work!",
    "This is the BEST all around climate change book!! I’ve done my own research trying to figure out where to put my energies - asking what are the main issues and how do I as an individual make a difference? It’s amazing how difficult it is to answer those two questions, the climate crisis is an overwhelming and confusing mess with no concise guidebook. It’s a never ending black hole of information all over the place and I’m always depressed afterwards feeling like the issue is too big for me to actually make a difference. This book truly sums it all up and puts everything in one place. This is the book that tells me what what the main issues are to focus on and action steps I can take, removes all the legwork for anyone who wants to help but doesn’t know where to start. And the great part is it offers hope. Buy this book today! You won’t regret it.",
    "Not a bad book - digestible and seemingly actionable.\nHowever, anyone else have an issue with the super high quality paper? I mean I’m all for quality but does it seem ironic given the subject?",
    "Many people have written and spoken about climate change, but this is the first time it has substance.\n\nIn this book John Doerr has interviewed and consulted experts and rich people to distill a plan to stall and reverse climate change, all framed, tracked and measured as a series of incredibly clear OKRs: 10 Objectives and 55 Key Results. The website tracks progress towards these and highlights the gaps in our leadership and industry.\n\nThis book is a must read for anyone & everyone.",
    "The first part of the book was the best (most shocking). The scale of the problem is laid out. The action plan is interesting to read, but is simplistic and too dependent on external political will. Maybe if politicians were to read the book we would get more traction.",
    "I like the structured approach but got lost in the numbers a bit along the way. Still a very good up to date book on climate action.",
    "How do we deal with the climate crisis? In this book John Doerr sets out a plan for the survival of humanity and our planet. If you only read one book about climate change, make it this one. It will give you understanding of the enormity of the challenge and hope that we can achieve it.",
    "Alright read, bit to techno optimistic. Not much detail about the how, only the what."

    "It's a matter of perspective.\n\nThat's this book in a nutshell. The 'almighty' statistic is largely a matter of how you look at it. Presentation matters more than as raw data. This is a good book for those curious how you can lie with 'irrefutable' numbers. In the case of statistics, most lies are by omission.\n\nIf you ever wonder how propaganda works this is a good place to start. Also check out Milgram's experiment, read some of the commentary from Goering at the Nuremburg Trials. Try watching Kabuki theatre, anime without watching the screen (i.e. listen to the dialogue alone), Yongyea who's a voice actor and video game news junkie, John Stossel's election campaign trails interview... If you want to learn how literally millions across the globe can be duped those are all good sources to observe the process.",
    "In 2016, all the best money was on Hillary Clinton to defeat Donald Trump in the U.S. Presidential election. Massive polls analyzed by highly-credentialed experts said so. The election went the other way. How could the analysts have gotten it so wrong? A potential answer is found in the pages of this short book written more than sixty years earlier by Darrell Huff and charmingly (if whimsically) illustrated by Irving Geis.\n\nThis book was recommended to me in passing by one of my professors when I was completing the capstone course for my BS in mathematics. Largely because of who suggested it, I expected a book about mathematical statistics. Instead, this is a book about understanding how statistical analysis can be abused (by journalists, politicians, advertisers, etc., etc.). It does not denigrate the practice of statistical analysis itself (though you will not learn even a single technique from statistical theory in its 144 pages), but rather serves as a lighthearted cautionary tale about how easy it is to become convinced that statistics carry all the weight of science even though statistical analysis is both science and art.\n\nThe reader already well-versed in statistics will not find any new information but will still be pleased by the book's artful presentation of known ideas. Readers who are not so well-versed in statistics should consider this book required reading because it succinctly explains how the information we all consume every day may have been manipulated--intentionally or otherwise--to give us false impressions.\n\nIn fact, I would argue the value of this book has only increased in the decades since its initial publication. While the reader picking up this book upon its publication in 1954 would surely encounter plenty of statistics and graphs throughout the week, our modern 24-hour news cycle and constant immersion in a multimedia world has magnified the opportunity for statistical deception. Of course, you'll find that the book's examples are outdated (references to an exorbitant $25,000 salary for Yale graduates might seem at first more quaint than informative). However, despite the dated examples, the statistical phenomena described are as relevant as ever. Indeed, an argument could be made that the examples from yesteryear might even aid the book's pedagogical value by avoiding the contemporary issues that might cause the reader to don partisan intellectual blinders.\n\nIf I were to criticize, I would say that the book fails as an introduction to statistical thinking. For example, it rightly cautions the reader to beware of the difference between median and mean when interpreting reported \"averages,\" but fails to provide much insight regarding when each of these measures of central tendency might be superior to the other. As such, the reader looking for insight regarding the practice of statistics, even from a non-technical perspective, may be disappointed. However, the reader interested in the consumption of statistical information will find a wealth of information packed into a charming little book.",
    "With all the statistics being tossed out daily during the COVID out break, this should be on everyones reading list. Early on you could see this book sitting on Bill Gates desk. The \"experts\" know this book, and they are giving you their opinion based on it. Shouldn't you know what they are Really saying?",
    "Good book if you are into analyzing correlated data and using info to debate. Good book to digest and ponder.",
    "\"How to Lie With Statistics\" softcover. Had to buy this for class and it was very insightful. It's small and good quality. I had no issues with this.",
    "This book is funny and so clever. It is dated (a wealthy man earns 15k/yr), but the ideas are absolutely relevant. I like to give this book as a gift because it’s so good and it’s also super entertaining and easy to read.",
    "Great book - Bill Gates favorite book - gee, I wonder why? Even stranger, why would he admit it and be ok with expressing this fact on the book itself? Bill has also been pictured with this book on his desk.. smh",
    "Bill Gates endorses this, but I didn't know that until I had it in my hands and saw that written on the cover. Good information in an age of lies!\n\nIn any case, I got this book for my teenage son and I to read together to help us both think more critically and accurately about what we are hearing on the news. It is VERY entertaining! Great book for teens or adults.",
    "I first read this book more than 60 years ago. It captures in an amusing way some of the techniques which were then, and still are today, used by advertisers governments and others to present data in a way which mis-leads those whom they are informing. Its main weakness is a tendency to be repetitive and confine itself to American information.\nStimulated by the ever-increasing use of statistics by politicians, commercial organisations , environmentalists and others, I am well on the way to completing a book on this subject myself. Still, we see such techniques as comparing two percentages (without any detail of the actual numbers involved - 80% of 20 is hardly to be compared with 60% of 20 000), references to the results of surveys -with no indication of how many people were surveyed, how the sample was selected, how the questions were asked and so on.",
    "I first read this book at university, where I was studying statistics as part of my degree. However, it has been in the context of other subjects and, indeed, life in general that this book has proven most useful.\n\nThe odd-sounding title is easily explained by the author himself. He says he wrote the book much in the same spirit as a burglar might write an instruction manual on how to break into people’s houses — not so much to make it easier for burglars to do so, but so that home-owners can see where their vulnerabilities lie.\n\nThese days, the book seems to be even more relevant. Not only are research findings reported in the papers virtually every day, but in education in particular there are quite a few articles of faith that are based on shaky, and sometimes non-existent, foundations.\n\nWith chapters like “The well-chosen average”, “The little figures that are not there” and “The semi-attached figure”, the book makes you look at statistics in a different way.\n\nFor example, if you were to read a report that tells us that research has shown that 98% of students derive no benefit whatsoever from using technology, you may have a vague feeling of unease about such a finding. However, having read this book you should be able to re-read the report and spot where the statistical sleight of hand occurred (assuming it did occur, of course).\n\nThen again, there are the endless announcements telling us that eating X wards off cancer, causes cancer, is dangerous for people over 40, is only dangerous if you eat more than one a day etc etc ad nauseous. Again, an insight into how some of the figures cited were derived would be immensely helpful in your decision-making.\n\nIllustrated with cartoons by Mel Calman, this light-hearted and slim volume punches way above its weight. Although it was first published over 60 years ago, in 1954, it is still relevant. It should be on every teacher’s shelf and in every school library.",
    "Great book for how politicians mislead you with \"statistics\" covid *cough cough*",
    "Much of the content of this book is not revolutionary but evolutionary, especially if you are an accountancy firm. The major thrust of this book is about agreed accountability, including everyone from the receptionist to the owners and their customers. It covers detailed methods with examples for his own company. It is more evolutionary partly because the basic theory is not new but in the context of an accountancy firm probable revolutionary.\n\nThe basic concept is that everyone, including customers, are accountable for their actions and therefore their impact on the success of the company. It highlights an important and fundamental problem associated with bottom-line focussed companies not acknowledging or realizing that not only are customers important to their profit but so are the workforce.\n\nThiss book addresses this in a well-structured way and is transparent in describing the journey of his company to a point where the profit has increased and staff are engaged with the company as stack holders. An excellent read and well worth giving as a gift, as the methods can be applied to other situation like parenting, relationships to name two.",
    "You need to read this book, and so does everyone you agree with, and everyone you disagree with.\n\nNo math required - this was written for the layperson. It's a quick and easy read. It is like putting on a pair of glasses that allow you to suddenly see clearly what you had never realised was blurred.\n\nThis is really about how to spot deceptive statistics, whether they were intentionally crafted to manipulate you, or unintentionally created due to ignorance or bias.\n\nIf you pay attention you will find modern examples for every \"outdated\" example in this book.\n\nPoliticians and marketers still use these techniques to mislead, and statistically naive scientists fool themselves (and unfortunately others) by making these mistakes.\n\nStop being misled. Read this book as soon as you can get your hands on a copy."

    "In this interesting take on what the essence of project management really is, the authors draw on a variety of experiences in which people who are individual contributors on a project actually use one or more project management competency. Considering any project or program of decent size normally involves the efforts of dozen to hundreds of people, there is a vast audience for this book. While this work does show how project management can inform and even make the working lives of non-project managers better, it is careful to caveat its advice by showing areas where more advanced study or experience is needed to fully execute a function to the level expected of an official project manager.\n\nAs a credentialed program manager (PMP), I really did not get a lot out of this book personally, but I did like its bare-boned and practical nature. I think that had I read this book before obtaining my credential it would have been very worthwhile. In my case, this book was a monthly pick by our local Project Management Institute book club to which I'm a part. I highly recommend this book for professionals of all types since even if they are in a technical field, to progress they will have to use and / or master many of the skills in this book someday.",
    "Best to do this as you move through. Applying the principals brings the clarity this book has to offer.",
    "A great, concise explanation on the five processes from the PMBOK with up to date and relevant examples/case studies. Some sections felt way too simplistic, but were not that many or that crucial to undermine significantly the book's success at training unofficial PMs.",
    "Great intro book if you want to be an official PM.",
    "I was skeptical looking for a textbook to help me in my new job that is more project management oriented than expected. I have only read 50 pages so far and it’s already helped me IMMENSELY. Highly recommend. (I am also not a project manager, but an “unofficial” one!)",
    "This book is great for new project managers, and it’s a good refresher for those who have done it for a long time. If you’re looking for something deep, I recommend choosing another book along side this one.",
    "Current review:\nThis book is helpful for the newbie, and worth a purchase. It won't give you everything, but it will really help you a lot.\n\nWhen I bought it I was stuck in the middle of a failing project, and I didn't find this book helpful.\n\nHowever, with 20/20 hindsight, I realize that the project failure was my fault because I didn't do enough project initiation, project discovery and project planning at the beginning. There were also some problems with disorganized resources on my team, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nI have been using the tools and techniques in this book to success to initiate my projects and also interview stakeholders on project closeouts, as well as other tools. I recommend this book to the unofficial project managers out there who want to grow in their roles.\n\nPrevious review:\nTitle: Surprisingly unhelpful\nStars: 2/5\n\nWith the accolades this book has printed on it, you'd think it was the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nI think I know more about project management after being in the trenches for a few months (I'm a career employee, but only recently switching more into project management), being mentored by a few PMPs in my organization and reviewing some PMI-inspired templates.\n\nI haven't finished this book and I'll go back and update if I do, but whenever I jump into a chapter to help me with whatever area I'm having trouble with, I don't find it helpful. We'll see.",
    "Those rating this book 3 stars or less are missing the point. The authors are spot on. In my 25 years in manufacturing management, the one skill I have to repeatedly coach on is what they call “Informal Authority “ This book provides a simple yet highly effective framework for learning and teaching project owners the leadership side of managing teams. Excellent quick read.",
    "As an enthusiastic BA thrust into a PM role, this was the book I needed.\n\nAll it needed was a DON’T PANIC sticker on it!\n\nVery. clear and well laid out - straightforward instructions on laying solid foundations for your project with good case studies. I’ve survived my first PM assignment.",
    "This book is worthy of review. How nice it is to get a book which actually delivers on its promises rather then be a disappointment. This book at 200 or so pages, is nice and quick to get to grips with rather than other huge project management books.\n\nThe info is to the point and what u need to know to make a project work without a load of pain down the line, for instance not properly getting all stakeholders expectations clearly mapped and agreed at the initiation stage of the project.\n\nFollow all the guidance in this book and your project is not going to backfire with you taking the blame.\n\nI very much recommend this book. I think the difference is I have used this book as the template for a recent project and what a difference it made. Rather than projects keeping me awake at night, I can handle it with this.",
    "This is a welcome addition to the plethora of Project Management books out there. It is a short, easy read, and what makes this book excellent is that it focuses on the concepts and not the templates - but gives you just enough to learn how to manage a project end to end.\nThis should be the first book for anybody new to Project Management",
    "It’s about 8 months that I’m working as a mechanical designer. Due to the fast pace environment of my job, we need to manage several projects at the same time so it’s essential to have the skills of an UNOFFICIAL PROJECT MANAGER. This book helped me to know the steps of a project by using examples and stories. Also, many tools are introduced by this book to help new UNOFFICIAL project managers to reach their goal.\n\nAlso this book is an easy to read book, which is attractive to people who are new to this field. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to everybody who wants to step inside the interesting world of project management.",
    "The book is an easy read which offers lot of practical advice. It focuses on the five process groups according to PMBOK, Initiating processes - Planing processes - Executing processes - Monitoring/controlling processes - Closing processes. It also offers at lot useful documents and checklists. And by using relatable stories, the book walks you through common situations and gives concrete recommendations on how to approach them.\n\nThe fact that the information is so well organized and summarized makes Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager a fast and straightforward read. It's an easy book to reference and is easy to follow."

    "I struggle to understand this book.\n\n1. Several entities/concepts/etc. are referenced throughout the book while not being sufficiently explained until 100+ pages later. An additional explanatory sentence here or there could go a long way in several instances. This is a disappointment for a 5th edition.\n\n2. Major governmental entities and their relationships are surprisingly missing from the book. You'd think that there'd be an entire chapter explaining the Department of Health and Human Services and its legion of sub-agencies (CDC, CMS, FDA, NIH, AHRQ, etc.).\n\n3. I can't determine who the expected reader of this book is. On one hand, the authors throw terms like MCO, PPO, and HMO at you as early as page 3 with little to no explanation as to what they are, leading me to expect that the intended reader has above average prerequisite knowledge of the industry. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the authors invest many pages covering far more basic concepts like defining what health is, what quality is, and even what a dentist is, leading me to expect that the intended reader have below average knowledge of the industry.\n\n4. I wish the authors would come out and say what they obviously believe, \"We wish America had a socialist, single-payer system. We know full well that it only works if you significantly ration care (we'll even admit that numerous times throughout the book), and we're fine with it.\" The last chapter ends on page 351, and if you omit illustrations, citations, etc. you'll get roughly 310 pages. I feel like 5-10% of those 310 pages are the authors passive aggressively bemoaning that we don't have a Bernie-care.\n\n5. Some chapters provide truly good information (specific/hard data or intellectual insight about relevant concepts), and some chapters feel like they contain none.\n\nHere's my recommended order to read the chapters: 4, 8, 7, 10, 9, and then 6. Read chapter 3 if the history (pre-1980) of the industry interests you. Feel free to skip chapters 1, 2, 5, and 11-14 as the little information they contain probably isn't worth your time.",

    "This book has been great for preparing me for the SHRM-CP/ SCP exam.",
    "The book is helping me to study for my certification",
    "I passed the CP test today. This book wasn't any help.\n\nI bought this about a week ahead of the SHRM-CP test. Most of the information is vague and not specific regarding the topics with no concrete information on US law or policy. Since it was relatively short in content, I thought what harm to at least read the information? When I took the sample test, I stopped after about 10 questions since it just felt like a waste of time almost to the point that it could be misleading. The sample questions did not feel legitimate.\n\nI purchased another study guide that was denser in content and was helpful in some of the areas specifically, helping me wrap my head around the situational questions and specifics about US laws and policies.\n\nOverall, I'm not a fan of this certification. Passing the SHRM certification tests involves developing a mindset around the question content and using common, logical sense except in the few cases where they reference information that is included in other materials. Most of the question can be answered by applying appropriate testing techniques.\n\nSHRM is an organization that created their own certification, marketing its own \"mystique\" about it's importance, provides expensive test prep courses and materials with a high cost of $400 to take the certification test.\n\nI'll add the certification to my resume, but that is about the only benefit that I can derive. Its' fine to have it but not a big differentiator.",
    "Good easy read",
    "contains both a study guide and lots of practice questions with detailed answers. book has everything advertised on the cover. Super helpful",
    "I TOOK THE SHRM-SCP EXAM on MAY 6, 2022. I had been studying for the SHRM-SCP for a few months and bought this book a few days before the exam. Since I had multiple other study resources (physical books, online practice exams, physical workbooks, flash card apps, etc.) I felt like I would do well on these practice questions. Every answer I chose on the first 14 questions was WRONG. I began to panic, I started to second guess what I had learned but was also questioning the logic and definitions of why I was getting ALL of them wrong. By question 15, I came to the realization that the content of this book is absolute garbage. You are literally paying $35 for a publisher to facilitate your failure while they take your money. I recommend \"SHRM CP Exam Prep 2022-2023: SHRM Certification Study Guide Book with 3 Practice Tests: [3rd Edition],\" the \"HR Cards\" app (it crashes all the time but the content is good) and the \"SHRM Society for Human Resource Management Complete Study Guide: SHRM-CP Exam and SHRM-SCP Exam 1st Edition\"to start. Best of luck to you!",
    "This is a great book that really helps to prepare you for the test with 480 qestions and detailed answers and 3 practice tests. It really helped me to prepare for the test and I am confident to take it.",
    "I am so angry I wasted my time studying this crap!! I haven’t taken the exam yet but the practice questions in this book are a complete joke. See the attached photo. Their correct answer is to shame the senior employee in front of everyone?? That is NOT how you handle something like that, not even close. Save your money!!!"

    "Reading this was like getting kicked in the butt. Nottage has her finger on the pulse of all that’s been going on over the course of the last two decades. The ending of the play just took me all the way out!",
    "I was drawn to this play once I read the sample. I couldn't put it down. I read it in less than 24 hours. It was a quick short read. I did have to continue going back to the list of characters. Many relationships without resolution bothered me in initially, but upon reflection that is what makes the play realistic. Glad no one dies!",
    "Nice book overall, pretty funny. Everything related to PA and Philly were correct. Didn’t like the ending, felt abrupt and lazy.",
    "I had to read this for my English class. Wasn’t the best book I’ve read but it was decent. Wouldn’t read it again though so.",
    "My book group read it and liked it but I thought it was too old fashioned in structure. It read like Clifford Odets and Arthur Miller in other American decades of economic hardship. She offered nothing new; capitalism crushes the workers. So what else is new? Nothing according to Nottage. What would really be great is an authentic experiment that resolves how people can live under a capitalist economic system without being destroyed. I'd hope for so much more from her, but William Inge could have written this.",
    "I have read all of Lynn's plays. Each is unique, each full of complex characters, each brutally honest and exquisitely painful. SWEAT is alarmingly accurate in its portrayl of depressed and backward Berks County, PA and the decline of factory, union, and the community. Relationships are both created and destroyed in this piece, as time flashes forward and backward, and the meanings of friendship and family are disolved and redefined.",
    "It is so important to pay attention to our history (both old and contemporary) and it’s cultural impacts on all socioeconomic classes. Theatre has the power to help society look in the mirror and decide if it is still headed in the right direction. I think Nottage’s play does a phenomenal job of creating a piece of that mirror.",
    "I taught this in my high school scene study course this year. It is a phenomenal script that is incredibly relevant to today's world. My teenagers - a mix of white, black, and latinx students - found this to be a great conversation starter about race issues. The script allowed us to explore controversial issues and difficult subjects in a way that everyone felt safe. Definitely a must read for up and coming theatre students.",
    "Ganhadora do Pulitzer na categoria teatro em 2017, SWEAT, de Lynn Nottage, é uma investigação poderosa sobre classe, identidade e trabalho nos Estados Unidos de hoje. O cenário é único: um bar na cidade de Reading, na Pennsylvania, chamada de “a cidade mais pobre dos EUA”, em 2012. A ação se passa em dois momentos, 2000 e 2008, quando uma crise econômica (cujas consequências perduram até hoje no mundo todo) acontece no país.\n\nOs personagens de Nottage são todos trabalhadores – working class – que se conhecem há anos, cresceram juntos, foram à mesma escola, e trabalham na mesma fábrica. Suas relações são, ao mesmo tempo, próximas e tensas. Suas figuras são construídas aos poucos, com ecos do passado reverberando no presente.\n\nO processo de desindustrialização local irá, é claro, refletir nos ânimos dos personagens com a ameaça constante de demissão, e as estratégias pouco idôneas de seus empregadores (nunca em cena). Uma figura central nesse movimento da peça é Cynthia, jovem afroamericana, que recebe uma promoção, primeiramente, comemorada pelos colegas, mas que depois a coloca numa posição delicada. Alguns acusam que ascensão só se deu por ela ser negra, outros de ela ter compactuado com os patrões no processo de demissão dos próprios amigos. Nottage investiga como as relações de trabalho e amizade acabam se fundindo em uma única coisa e as consequência disso.\n\nOriginalmente de 2011, SWEAT tem uma inacreditável relação com o presente. No condado de Berky, do qual Reading é uma das principais cidades, Trump teve uma vitória expressiva contra sua concorrente, Hilary Clinton, e, mesmo de forma avant la lettre, a peça dá conta de explicar essa vitória, de mostrar como os discursos do candidato republicano pode ter falado ao coração dessas pessoas.\n\nO resultado não é apenas uma peça excepcional, mas um comentário político sutil e relevante que dá conta do estado das coisas no presente de maneira luminosa. Questões raciais, de classe e de economia são tratadas com honestidade e profundidade, e o resultado é um olhar sagaz sobre o presente dos EUA.",
    "Gostei bastante do livro, retrata bem o drama passado por muitos cidadãos americanos. Sua linguagem informal nos faz entrar ainda mais na emoção dos personagens.",

I can still understand it, and the font is large enough to read without my 1.75 readers. But…unless you wanna brush up on your post-Shakespearean phrasings and grammatical structure, you might wanna look for something a lil more…uhm…updated.",
    "The messages were clear and easy to follow and it was a quick read which I appreciate. But I feel like the book is out of order, you start by reading all of the lessons then at the end of the book it tells you how to read and study the lessons and lists a series of questions to think about after each lesson… That was bizarre, but I guess I would recommend it to someone just starting out on their personal finance journeys, but again, not my favorite",
    "I love this book. The study questions at the end of the book are really helpful. I’d give this book to anyone who needs a simple roadmap for financial success.",
    "The book is a quick read, but one that must be read and applied to the rest of your life. These simple principles are sound and can be used immediately for more than just finacial security. It can be applied to the people we spend time with, the educations that we persue and so on.",
    "Great advice for building your nest egg, dealing fairly with people, and being as prepared as possible for life",
    "Item was of the most sterling quality. Fast delivery. Radiant packaging. Seller is choice and grand.",
    "For people who have no interest in investing -- or THINK they have no interest -- this book can serve as a fun and more readable entry point to the basic concepts. Written in parable form, it's a lighter and more engaging \"story-like\" introduction to basic investment principles such as allocation and earning interest (or other return on investment). Although it's a far cry from being detailed enough to be actionable, it could certainly whet the appetite of the unitiated and propel them to seek out more information about financial planning.",

    "The Servant is a work of fiction by James C. Hunter about a businessman named John Daily whose life is in a bit of a tail-spin. All aspects of John’s life are in jeopardy and before he falls off the deep end, he agrees to attend a spiritual retreat at a Catholic monastery. The author uses fiction to present actual leadership principles. The author cleverly uses a monk/teacher to profess to retreat-goers/students wisdom about the true nature of leadership and humility.\nThe book has a spiritual and sometimes religious ambiance to it; John experiences a series of coincidences regarding the biblical character Simeon from the book Luke. The name Simeon came to him at several important times in his life, making it impossible to forget. Then, John experiences a recurring dream where a character in the dream chases him and then tells him “find Simeon – find Simeon and listen to him.” Of course when he meets this monk, the teacher, and learns that his monastic name is Simeon, and that he is the former a fortune 500 executive he’d heard about, a vale is lifted and John begins a journey to become the leader he is destined to be.\nAnother bit of cleverness shown by the author is that other retreat-goers in this story are from other walks of life; therefore, showing how these leadership principles can work not only in business, but also in the military, athletic coaching, medicine, parenting, education, and the ministry. The author is able to present these timeless, servant-leadership principles through a week’s worth of group sessions at the monastery where the monk leads the retreat-goers to leadership enlightenment.\nOnce John arrives at the monastery, the author jumps right in and begins setting the stage with Simeon teaching well-known psychological principles designed by world-famous psychologist, Abraham Maslow, to define the needs of subordinates, which I found to be a great way to mix truths into his fiction. By defining these needs and showing why there would be discomfort in the workplace when these basic needs aren’t met. The author, through Simeon, builds and lays out a progressive lesson using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as a foundation, and culminating in a thorough blueprint for those in leadership positions to become true leaders.\nI found the author’s use of the teachings of Jesus to be ingenious. He discusses to 1 Corinthians 13:4-8: “4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away (taken from the NIV).” He uses this chapter to define the word love and to show that love is often actually used as a verb. To love someone requires action, e.g., to love one’s neighbor does not mean to sit around dreaming of holding hands with them on long walks. To love one’s neighbor is to be patient, kind, humble, respectful, selfless, forgiving, honest, and committed. It’s much like the word care as a verb; to care for someone requires action.\nI enjoyed a quote by the character Simeon: “Your feelings of respect must be aligned with your actions of respect, John.” (pg. 49). This is interesting to me because one thing I heard a lot in the Army was: “There is a difference between showing respect and having respect. While respect must be earned, as soldiers you are required to show respect to your superiors at all times regardless of how you may actually feel.” While this is different than what Simeon was saying, it’s an example of leadership speed bumps in the military. It is a form of deception, as per Hunters definition of lying, that soldiers are forced to do. This illustrates a multi-service breakdown in effective leadership that has been going on for hundreds of years.\nAnother thought the author shared was that paradigms can and sometimes should shift or change all together. Many paradigms can be linked to fears and can become downright counterproductive. While I don’t agree with everything found in The Servant, if leaders would practice at least some of the principles outlined in its pages, paradigms could shift and fears could diminish, leaving more energy for productivity and customer service, and less wasted trying to please the bosses.\nOne of the best quotes of the character Simeon was his definition of a leader: “…someone who identifies and meets the legitimate needs of their people, removes all the barriers, so they can serve the customer. Again, to lead you must serve.” In defining leadership he said it “…was the skill of influencing people to work enthusiastically toward goals identified as being for the common good.”\nThis is a great book for anyone wanting to be a better boss. I think if anyone is willing to set aside their ego long enough to read and incorporate the principles written in this book, they can become a better boss. I don’t think there is anything new in this book or particularly groundbreaking, but I think Hunter has brought together several other writers ideas and packaged them in a nice—easy to read book that’s not too long or boring. There are biblical references and secular references. The story is interesting enough to keep the pages turning. All of the information is useful. Concepts like relational banking from “The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People” reference in chapter five can cause people to think about relationships in a different and more positive way. Hunter skillfully wove these relative ideas into fiction making professional development fun and entertaining. I plan to recommend this book to my friends.\nI found Praxis to be very relevant and relative to leadership. This concept is a process originating in Greece thousands of years ago; it’s a process by which a theory is realized. This was explained starting on page 148. The wisdom “that faith without works is dead” comes to mind. A person in a leadership position can read all the leadership books on the market and brainstorm on them night and day, but if the individual doesn’t actually begin making the behavior changes, nothing will change. One cannot think their way into right action, he must act his way into right thinking. Now, if his thinking becomes right through study and effort, the change to right action can come much easier, but will still only come through actual effort. The thinking, or feelings, will follow and reinforce the behavior. It’s a great lesson towards self-actualization. It’s also a practical and effective way to break bad habits in behavior, e.g., talking down to subordinates or interrupting people while they’re talking.\nOne of the aspects of this book I like is that Hunter doesn’t approach leadership like the average motivational speaker, other than perhaps Dr. Wayne Dyer. Hunter doesn’t tell us to seize leadership or approach it like a fight. Hunter doesn’t try to tell us that business is war and if you don’t take charge someone else will. True leadership cannot be forced. While I have used or have been accustomed to some different terminology regarding power and authority, the principles are the same. Where Hunter says the authority is earned, as former military and current reserve law enforcement, we look at authority as the right to power. The word I use is trust where Hunter uses authority, e.g., to be a true leader, followers must trust you. The way I’ve been taught in the military and in law enforcement training, the gun is the power and the uniform or the badge is the authority, or the right to use that power; however, I do understand and agree with the principle.\nI could go on and on about the usefulness of this book, but I’ll just say one more time that if one uses these basic character building blocks, I believe he or she could become a much more effective and productive manager. And, if these concepts of real love and selfless service are mastered, he or she may even become a true and influential leader. One last thought that sums up what I believe Hunter would like his readers to take away from this book is that, “Once they have bought into the leader, they will buy into whatever mission statement the leader’s got.” I thought it was a great book.\nThe Servant was written by James C. Hunt, published by Prima Publishing of Roseville, California, and copy written in 1998. I believe I paid $8 for a paperback version from Amazon.com. ISBN: 0-7615-1487-2.\nThe only other book by Hunter is nonfiction: “The World's Most Powerful Leadership Principle: How to Become a Servant Leader,” a complement to The Servant. This second book is a useful \"how to\" book which includes a step-by-step path leading to the principles of Servant Leadership. ISBN-10: 1578569753 | ISBN-13: 9781578569755. His books have been translated into 2 dozen languages and have sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nFollow me on Twitter",
    "I rrqd this book at college for a community service class about 11 years ago and to this day, it's still very impactful. The writing is very real and speaks to the heart on the importance of being a servant leader in today's work society. It's even more important than ever to be doing that! If you want to read a book that is very impacted and will leave you thinking, check this one out. It won't disappoint!",
    "As the author claims, no new principles, rules or guides. Century old concepts that reminds us that leadership transcends time, cultures, and even religions.",
    "Love the story and it’s inspirational",
    "Very well written with priceless advise would recommend for any manager or supervisor to read",
    "This book was given to me and hardback as well and we used it for our leadership training sessions. It gave me another perspective on love. It showed me it was an action and not a feeling. I needed this book for the season I'm in and the seasons to come. I recommend this book for all those who want to be or who are a leader. This book will indeed change your perception.",
    "Overall, I found this book to be scripted and cliche'. The teacher only seems to get asked questions to which he has the answers. The individual characters seem like charicatures. I find the way in which they all become equally enlighted at the of the story to feel really fake.\n\nThat said, this book has some really good points. Most of them borrowed from others who have said it better and simply regurgitated here using narrative format with very simple language. Personally, I have found the greatest success (there have been few for me as a leader) when I have placed myself in the service of others. It is also helpful in understanding the need to meet peoples needs rather than just their wants. Good things to say about bounderies, integrity, and so on.\n\nHowever, I really must take issue with a number of the points the book makes.\n\nPG 32-33\nAll employees are volunteers of sorts. They can freely choose to work where they want. They can freely choose when to leave.\n\nWell that ain't really so. Last time I checked there were a number of factors that limit our choices i.e. education, age, geography, physical/mental capabilities, and so on. This book is a big proponent of free choice and a critic of determinism. Not surprising given its basis in evangelical thinking. They even site Frankl on matter of free choice later in the book. Fact is yes, we have choices but there are limitations on those choices. This is not a bad thing, it just is.\n\nSo basically, some folks stay in bad jobs because they need the money for food, rent, and gas. That can put them at a disadvantage when it comes to their relationship with their employer. Do not forget the power that money can yield in this society especially when you have limited sources of it. In many cases, the employer still holds a lot of the cards. Consider the children in developing nations that sew our childrens soccer balls together.\n\nPG 43-44\nMoney ranks #4 among what employees want.\n\nMoney still ranks and frankly it is a function of being treated with dignity and respect. Our financial compensation is based on how much value we create financially but it is also a reflection of how much value is placed on us. Consider the child mentioned above. Consider how much money he makes and then consider the profits of the soccer ball company. Consider the compensation of the CEO for that soccer ball company. Consider that workers wages have consistently declined while executive compensations and corporate profits have soared.\n\nPG 120\nThrow-away society\n\nNo doubt we are a throw-away society and perhaps I am the worst offender in this regard. But I find the use of abortion to support this point to be problematic.\n\nThere is a comment here suggests that the decision to have an abortion is as simple and easy as tossing away something unwanted. There are so many points to be made against this that I am not sure where to begin. But I will end here, this is a difficult decision for any person or couple to make. If they are pro-life (that's right folks pro-life people have abortions) or if they are pro-choice, it is a emotional, serious, and tough choice to make. It is even tougher to follow through with. I would be naive if I did not say that there are people who are flipant about this decision but that is extremely rare. The vast majority of people make such a significant decision carefully and thoughtfully.\n\nPerhaps a better example, one that is never touched on very strongly, is the amount of resources that we use compared to our population. Not sure the exact percentages here but in the USA we consume a large portion of the available resources relative to our population. How about those gianormous SUVs we see crusing around the burbs? You know the ones that get about 10 miles to the gallon? I could be wrong here but their sole purpose seems to be to prop up the ego. Is that not wasting resources? The take more material to manufacture, utilize, and maintian than cars 1/2 to 1/3 their size. If the purpose of a vehicle is to get us and our gear from point A to point B AND a smaller vehicle will do the job, then isn't any vehicle larger than that in effect a waste? Is that not simply throwing away resources that could be better used elsewhere? Wouldn't our world be better served by a more wise use of our resources? How about applying servanthood in this context?\n\nPG 153\nSmokers blame cigarette companies to their addiction.\n\nFor the most part, I have to agree with the book on this one but fact is the cigarette companies deliberately manipulated nicotine levels so as to maxmize the chances for the smokers addiction. Yes, everyone who put that first cigarette in their mouth made that choice freely AND there are plenty of people who struggled with the difficulty of quitting to shake the habit. So we know it can be done. But the fact is, the cigarette companies stacked the deck...or pack...in their favor to intentionally addict users and ensure a continued market for their product. They even went so far to create cartoon characters to market their product so as to get young people to smoke. Here again, coupled with nicotine levels intended to produce addiction, they ensure a stable and reliable market for their products and profits. All this while internal documents clearly and directly link their product to cancer and heart diesease. Were it not for these actions, the books point would have been stronger.\n\nIf we are talking about being servants here then where is the service in the cigarette companies actions? Where is their responsiblity? There is a subtle message here that corporations are not to blame for the impact of their actions. Why isn't the notion of responsibilty that is applied to individuals also leveled at corporations?\n\nPG 154\nThe Twinkie Defense\n\nThis is simply a bad example. The so called Twinkie Defense was hyped by the media to grab the public's attention and create ratings. If you take about 10 seconds to drill down into the issue, you would find that the legal defense of Dan White based based on a bi-polar disease and not twinkies. Twinkies were simply evidence supporting an overall defense based upon mental illness. And from what little I know, the guy was definately whacked. He should be held responsible but still he was whacked out.\n\nMy point is this. As a casual observer of the news, we can have these sort of knee-jerk reactions and comments. As a published author, one has a greater responsibility to get their story straight. Otherwise, we simply perpetuate a half-baked understanding of the facts. Where is the servant in that?\n\nOkay, I am off my soap box.",
    "For anyone aspiring to be in leadership (effective leadership, this book is a must read. I always wanted to be in a leadership position, but I had no idea how to true my lead. I’m glad I never got the promotion for which I applied because I would have failed miserably, I believe. This book is encouraging, thought provoking, insightful and just fantastic. I feel like I can and should read this book again and again just to remind myself of what effective leadership is.",
    "Although a little wordy, the message in this anecdotal story is perfect for the modern leadership vision. An easy and engaging read, as well as very thought provoking, whilst incredibly simple\n\nIt embodies the ONLY way a leader can fully succeed sustainably in every environment.\n\nI’d encourage every leader or anyone thinking if leading others to read this, take the message and be that servant for your people.\n\nYou will never regret it.",
    "I feel qualified to give this a good review as I hold a senior leadership position in a large global corporate company. In the 21st century there is little room for the old \"top down\" heavily hierarchical organizations of the last century, as this is a recipe for disaster. Now the customer is king (and rightly so) and business must be completely focused on exceeding customer expectation. The simple premise of servant leadership is that you flip the org chart 180 degree's and from the CEO upwards each layer of leadership and management is there to support, empower and get the very best from the people they are responsible for. With a culture focused on delivering great customer value (which can be internal as well as external)it has the power to make good business's great and also turn around failing ones.\n\nThis book is a great introduction to the concepts of servant leadership and tells a story in a practical way that is easily digested and implementable into any leadership situation be it business related or not.",

    "As someone who wants to improve the way I interact with others, I found this book quite helpful. It’s not overwhelming with loads of information, but rather breaks down the art of good conversation and speaking while providing great tips which can be used in everyday life. This book is great for beginners or anyone wanting to sharpen up their skills.",

    "This author does not return to her words to edit them, and the result is a book that doesn't always have the correct advice. If you aren't willing to edit your content then you don't deserve to publish for an audience. If you're going to write essays but not review them for advice, it's publishing a disservice to your audience. The following is not about not editing for advice, but for including the wrong term.\n\nOn page 8 you use the term \"deep dive.\" You're not using this term how it's used by professionals in all industries - to mean to get in deeply on all specifics of the information on the topic to be reviewed. The surface questions you use as research here are not at all a \"deep dive\" - it doesn't get into information but elicits a response. Asking a \"personal question\" is neither a \"deep dive.\" Having one response from a question doesn't mean that the questioner has insight equal or similar to the person responding to questions. It's really erroneous to use the term \"deep dive\" in your book there because the person understands that own person much more comprehensively than the other person asking questions. Making your book about the surface is still what you did in effect.",

    "I think the most important thing to know about Patrick Kings writing style is that he gets very much to the point. A lot of books for personal growth will draw out long stories that lead up to the point they are trying to make, but this isn't always a necessary process. Patrick tends more toward short anecdotes which illustrate the same points more succinctly. His books could be a little longer and cover more information but then again they could also be more expensive as a result. His books are like if someone were to give you a guitar and teach you how to strum a few chords so you could get to playing music, rather than first learning everything there is to know about music theory.",
    "I am surprised I'm writing this but hot damn. This gives actual practical things to do not just theory. That's what blew my mind is the structure. It shows an idea, how it may be thought of, breaks it down, gives examples and then shows you how to use it. I typed some notes down from the book in my Google Docs to glance at for reminders and..... I just talked my face off. Coming from an introvert with depression and anxiety.....that's saying a lot. What I love is that in the back of my mind I knew I COULD be more social I just didn't know how or what tool(s) to use. I've only used a few pieces so far and it's been a game changer.\n\nI feel weird in writing such a glowing review someone's gonna be like FAKE.

    "The author might be good at performing presentations but it doesn’t transmit well on to the page. It’s tone is condescending to the reader; assuming a level of incompetence.

    "Would recommend. Great overall brief look thru history. Buy the whole series.",
    "I read a lot of the reviews on this book - especially the negative reviews - and had to write my own because I think there are many ways to approach this book series.\n\nThis is our first year homeschooling our 4th grade daughter and we met and grilled many of the homeschool mothers in our area on their system of teaching. One of them recommended the Wise/Bauer book \"The Well-Trained Mind\" which seemed to be a very good fit for both my teaching style and our daughter's learning style. \"The Well-Trained Mind\" recommends, of course, this series of books for teaching history. But what a lot of people are missing, I think, is that Volume 1 is meant for 1st grade, Volume 2 for 2nd grade, etc. These 4 volumes are also meant to be the first of 3 levels of teaching history as the child goes through his/her 12 years of education. In other words, these four volumes are laying the groundwork for what's to come. It's not a be-all end-all history course.\n\nThe reason my approach is different is because I'm using this series of books to catch my daughter up to where a well-educated child should be by the 4th grade. Up through to the end of 3rd grade in the public school system, the only exposure she'd had to history is to the timespan just before and just after the American revolutionary war. So we had a lot of ground to cover. But I didn't want it to turn into a grind for her, so I took the authors' intentions to heart and I'm using this series to form a groundwork for a basic understanding of history.\n\nSo what I'm doing is covering all four volumes in 1 year. That works out to a little over 2 months per volume or 4 chapters (for Volume 1) per week. I skipped the activity book but did buy the workbook with the quizzes. We've read to our daughter since she was a baby and she still loves to be read to, so for the 1-hour class (which I hold twice a week) I read 2 chapters to her, discussing what we're reading as I go along. She loves it and the book is easy to read from. Before class starts, I give her 2 quizzes from the 2 chapters read in the previous class. She gets about as many questions right as I would and it's just to help reinforce what I've read to her.\n\nSo all the complaints about inaccuracies in the book and the author's religious slant (which I didn't find and I was looking for), they don't matter. What really matters is that my daughter enjoys learning about history (it's her favorite class) and she's building a foundation that can be built on in later years.\n\nIn addition to this series and its workbooks, I also picked up \"The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia.\" Once a week I give her homework to read assigned pages from this book to reinforce or, perhaps, to give a different point of view on what she's just learned.\n\nAll history books will turn up people who will disagree with the content, will find inaccuracies in the material, or won't agree with the author's point of view. But, guess what? It doesn't matter. Your child is still young and you are filling in a background in history that his/her public school peers will never have.",
    "This book makes a good first skim through history for little ones. We are using in our homeschool with our kindergartener. She does enjoy the little storylines of the kid in certain time periods. I will say as a Chrostian there is A LOT of talk about false gods: Greek, Egyptian, Roman, Asian and African fables. There are also biblical references such as moses, Jericho etc. All in all it's a good introduction to familiarize little ones with terms and time periods. You can skip parts and chapters without confusion if you wish to to leave out things that your not ready to teach your child. We bought vol. 2 also.",
    "I am a homeschooling mom with a preschooler, a kindergarten student, and a fourth-grader. This book is great for all of them. I will alternately read aloud or play the audio version (in the car, during lunch, etc.). They love it! The chapters are short and easy to understand. The book itself is not intense and it wasn't made to be. The earliest age is six! If the language is too sophisticated or dry, the children will lose interest. I would too! There are lots of stories and myths from some of the different cultures of those times. It gives my children insights to different cultures and their traditions. The book is also helpful to enrich their understanding of what was happening in the world around the same time as some biblical events. It puts into perspective events like Abram moving, Joseph in Egypt, David, all the fighting and wars, etc. But in a way a child can grasp. As a Christian parent, it is hard to fill in the historical gaps or make sense of certain events. This book certainly helps. As far as I can tell, this book in no way, modifies or takes away the gospel message found throughout the Bible and history. So, for the reviewer who complained about the author's adding that Abram's father was scared, so they moved the family......duh! Who wouldn't be scared about constant fighting, being killed, and the threat of losing everything? Many ancient peoples moved for those very same reasons. It isn't unreasonable to make that jump, especially when you are trying to explain these complicated topics to a young child.\n\nThe negative reviews are garbage. What are people expecting? The Economist? Newsweek? An SAT study guide? This book is an introduction (condensed version) of the ancient world. The accompanying activity book has additional resources and activities for people who want more information. As for the claims of how a person felt at a particular time, of course that is speculation! Much of history is speculation! We use what we can find evidence of and fill in the gaps based on the collective information we have for that time period. I delve more into the information with my older child by using the activity guide and test booklet. If you're not keen on using this as a textbook, then read it to your children before bed. I guarantee your kids will get excited about history. Isn't that the goal of education? Not to get them to memorize a bunch of nameless faceless facts, but to get them excited, spark their curiosity, and encourage them to learn independently. This book is certainly a tool that can be used for that purpose.\n\nI have purchased the next book and my family cannot wait to begin that book as well.",
    "Charlotte Mason style history book! We love how it incorporates history with the Bible. And we like the stories in it! We use this as a read aloud book for our 6 yr old, and she loves it. It’s never boring to listen to.",
    "Excellent book I cannot recommend enough. I do not homeschool my children but use this book almost every day to teach history chronologically after school, to try to make some sense for them. Great book !",
    "My son ( 7 years old) loves this book! We are reading it every night and we are reading about 20-30 minutes as he keeps wanting to know more and more. I myself found it really interesting too ! I don't really like the legends stories they tell sometimes but I got it for my son who is homeschool and can't put it down.",
    "Really fantastic book! We’re still working our way through it but it’s great, I’m enjoying it as much as the children!",
    "I’m really glad that I got this book for my children. I was recommended this from a friend and I’m really glad she did. I’m learning along side my children. Suitable for all ages."

    "William O'Neil the author has just published his magnum opus and its a wonderful book to show the small investor how to attain wealth in an effective and systematic fashion.\n\nThis book is a guide to understand how the Stock Market really works. William O'Neil perfected his CAN-SLIM method in the 1960's to make himself a multi-millionaire. He felt that his investment system was something most people could learn so he launched a newspaper in 1984 called Investment Business Daily (IBD) to teach small investors how to invest well and increase their net worth significantly.\n\nDuring the go-go Bull market years of the 1990's IBD reached a subscription level of over 300,000 subscribers and competed head-on the the venerable and established Wall Street Journal (WSJ). I am convinced IBD is the superior newspaper because it specifically teaches the small investor how to outperform Mutual Funds by using the small investor's main advantage - the ability to get in and out of the market quickly. This advantage when properly used allows the small investor to avoid the major damage of a huge Bear market downturn such as in the case of 2001-2002 and also in 2008. Mutual Funds being so heavily invested with billions of dollars of stocks are not so nimble; consequently they usually take heavy losses during large market downturns such as in 2008.\n\nHis system is called CAN-SLIM. It is a complex set of rules; so allow yourself two years to learn the basics. You will have to master the reading of technical charts and understand fundamentals of various companies. You need to understand concepts such as Sales, Earnings, Return on Equity (ROE) , how Mutual Funds operate, accumulations, distributions, relative price strength (RPS), cups and handles, breakouts, 50-day moving averages, base failures, puts, calls, pivot points, double bottoms, growth stocks vs value stocks, accumulation days etc. Understanding these concepts is not for the faint hearted; there is a lot to learn.\n\nO'Neil will show you the way with his book. Unfortunately the rules are very, very counter-intuitive and contrary to so called \"conventional investment wisdom\" and what most investment pundits advise. It will probably go against everything you have been taught in life. That is why most people have difficulty applying CAN-SLIM methods because it is so counter-intuitive. For example: What really works well is to buy high and sell higher. We are conditioned to buy low and sell high. This latter approach is not effective in the stock market but most people buy in the \"conventional wisdom\" manner and in many cases get clobbered. 98 % of individual investors buy stocks this way and it is not effective. You also need to know when the Bear Market is coming so you can exit and go to cash for safety. IBD provides the early warning indicators when the Bear is near.\n\nThere is much to learn in order to win against the Stock Market and how it really works. But it can be done ! To do so you need to be a hard worker and be able to learn from your mistakes. Learning CAN-SLIM is similar to learning upper-level math courses such as statistics. There are no royal roads or shortcuts in learning and applying CAN-SLIM rules. It is not an easy subject to learn. You should also have access to the Enhanced Daily Graphs to see both the Fundamental and Technical Analysis displayed on one page. You will need these tools to win this financial war; these tools provide the key financial intelligence to let you know what is really occurring in the world of the stock market.\n\nI also recommend you keeping notes in a journal of some type. This will help you to learn the skills needed. You must also develop a skill in reading the charts to understand the psychology of what is happening in the market place. There are about 100 charts of past winners to study which provide the guide for picking future stock winners if you are able to recognize the patterns. If you can read the past history well you can predict the future. It will appear like you are looking at Latin and Greek symbols at first and will seem unintelligible for awhile but after much practice you will readily start seeing patterns. These patterns provide the entry and exits points for effective stock buys.\n\nWhy is learning this method so hard ? Here are some of the key CAN-SLIM rules that must be mastered if you do not want to financially hurt by the Stock Market:\n\n1) Buy stocks above $ 20 per share at the optimum pivot point in a buying surge during a strong Bull Market and sell at a higher price.\n2) Always cut your losses at 7 - 8 % when buying.(Most important rule).\n3) If initially successful; pyramid your buying up.\n4) Stay in cash during a Bear Market.\n5) Never argue with the Stock Market; it is always right.\n6) Concentrate your stock buying and watch your stocks closely.\n7) Do not over diversify.\n8) Read the investment classics by Jesse Livermore, Gerald Loeb, Benard Baruch and Nicolas Darvas. They are the pioneers in this field and the teachers that William O'Neil discovered after reviewing over 2000 stock investment books in the early 1960's. Only few authors such as Jesse Livermore and Gerald Loeb were deemed worthwhile. William O'Neil learned their methods, added some of his findings and crafted their wisdom into a complete and effective but complicated system called CAN-SLIM.\n9) Keep your ego in check. Stay objective. Don't celebrate too much when you win; Don't get depressed when you get losses.\n10) Keep your gains big & Keep your losses small.\n11) Buy high and sell higher (very counter-intuitive !)\n12) High diversification of stocks ensures mediocrity; Concentration in the right stocks leads to large gains.\n13) Yearly gains of 20 - 100 % are possible in strong Bull markets while in Bear Markets your capital is preserved.\n\nI have also subscribed to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for twenty (20) years. But the WSJ does not provide the information that is in IBD. IBD is unique and is an investment education conduit for people who are active learners and who wish to increase their net worth significantly.\n\nThe WSJ has some good in-depth articles on business news but doesn't inform the small investor when to be in or out the market or how to pick the best growth stock leaders. This is the gap which IBD fills ! I am convinced IBD is by far the more valuable newspaper for the small investor.\n\nEffective use of the IBD tools is like a financial light sabre that will allow you to make significant financial gains especially in the first year of a strong Bull Market.\n\nThese methods are for those who do not mind hard work. You must be able to learn from your mistakes and be tenacious in learning the complexities of the Stock Market. If you are looking for an easy way to make significant money you need to look elsewhere. You will not be happy trying to learn very complex and counter-intuitive concepts. If do you pursue this study; it will probably take you at least 2 years to learn CANSLIM well. It is an art as well as a science.\n\nWhat about actual results ? I am a Chief Engineer in Aerospace and the skills and knowledge I have picked up in the last 5 years with O'Neil's system has added about $100,000 each year to my savings since 2006. The time I spend on it each week is about 3 to 4 hours so it is like having a second job. I have not quit my day job but with the extra savings I have more peace of mind and with three children to send thru college in the near future I am confident I will be able to do so. In short - I may not be on easy street yet but I feel like I am out of the salt mines. This CANSLIM approach has worked well for me and I hope to improve my skills in it by continued study. I plan to get better at this. This system does work well.\n\nThank you Mr. O'Neil......you are a great teacher and wonderful philanthropist for the small investor. Highest recommendation for you, the reader to use this system to make money in the stock market.",
    "A comprehensive (and demonstraby successful) investment approach - beyond mere stock screening, June 13, 2009\nBy William L. Lyman \"FreeMarket\" (ATLANTA, GA USA) - See all my reviews\n(REAL NAME)\nThe CANSLIM stock investing methodology outlined in \"How to Make Money in Stocks\" is a time tested method that incorporates how the equity (stock) market(s) really work - for the passive, minority, outside investor. It is a 80/20 approach (with William O'Neil's approach, proprietary metrics and tools you can achieve 80% of the success with 20% of the effort) and explicitly rides the coattails of the market (read and react - don't fight/argue with the market). This system *IS* designed for the individual investor and small professional investor - I'm not sure it would scale for $250 million portfolios and above (but I'm not sure that it wouldn't either).\n\nCANSLIM is part fundamental (here earnings growth is the primary focus), part structural, part timing/technical and part money/risk management (this part is **crucial** to investment success). The vast amount of other investing books will typically provide only a screening/selection approach, but \"How to Make Money in Stocks\" provides a comprehensive investment approach including stock selection, portfolio composition, selling criteria and money/risk management.\n\nIn short - buy stocks that have a reason to go up (a new product/management catalyst, a leading stock in one of the top 20% of the 196 IBD industry groups, strong earnings growth (>25%), solid Return on Equity (> 17%), reasonable leverage, etc.) when the stock is poised to breakout (strong and increasing institutional shareholder support, has outperformed at least 80% of the market over the previous 52 weeks, the stock is consolidating after a price run-up and breaks-out on trading volume that is significantly higher than the average trading volume over the last 50 days, etc.) and finally - and this is important - scale into your positions, pyramid up in the first 5% or price appreciation and cut you losses when the stock moves against you at 7-8% from your purchase price - NO QUESTIONS/NO EXCUSES/NO RATIONALIZATION.\n\nCheck out the independent and unbiased American Association of Individual Investors (AAII Dot Com) - they have tracked the monthly performance of 56 stock screens since January 1998 (now 11+ years) and the CANSLIM screen is consistently in the top 3 screens with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over that time in excess of 25%. While the AAII \"recipe\" for CANSLIM (and other screens for that matter)is a simplified approach and does not implement a strict constructionist approach (and contains buy rules only - no sell rules, just monthly re-screening - and no money/risk management techniques), it is an OUTSTANDING educational tool to learn about the pros and cons of the various stock screens and provides a starting point for anyone considering CANSLIM for their portfolios.\n\nI personally have used CANSLIM with tremendous success since the late 1980s and participate in our local Meetup (AAII-atlanta Dot Com) where we utilize the CANSLIM approach. While most people assume this approach generates outstanding returns in the go-go bull markets (and it does), it really earns its keep in the down markets by utilizing the 7-8% stop loss on a stock by stock basis as part of a concentrated portfolio. It was a financial life safer in 1999/2000 and again in 2008/2009. Value investors (mutual funds), by contrast, were obliterated in 2008 - down some 50-60%! If that great \"margin of safety\" doesn't pay off in that environment - when does it?!\n\nThis growth/momentum approach differs substantially from a valuation driven approach (e.g., the Morningstar 5-star system based Morningstar's estimate of \"fair value\" of the stock compared to its current stock price). But if you trade based only on your (or a 3rd-party's) estimate of fair value, be prepared for some roller-coaster rides. In fact, check out Morningstar's own performance of their 5-star ranking system for the 2,000+ stocks that they cover and for their tortoise and hare portfolio - it pales in comparison to CANSLIM. The valuation only approach is for full-time professionals only - and even then - only the best of the best have been able to produce reasonable returns over time. Like the choice embedded in the title of Ned Davis's book \"Being Right or Making Money\", CANSLIM allows you to make money, while the purist value investors will argue about \"being right\" with *their8 discounted cash flow calculations (if only the market marched to that tune).\n\nAnd finally, yes, the book discusses the Investors Business Daily (IBD) newspaper (and of course, CANSLIM) as the IBD newspaper and associated website (Investors Dot Com) have the tools to easily implement the CANSLIM methodology (SmartSelect(TM) ratings and other proprietary metrics). And William O'Neil is not just another financial author - he is a very successful investor, entrepreneur and financial data services provider.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse this book and methodology - and recommend it to EVERYONE who is considering investing directly in common stocks. Even if they pursue another style of investing, there are many excellent lessons to embrace from \"How to Make Money in Stocks\".",

    "The book is highly informative with plain and simple common sense investing which is fully backed up with long term research.\n\nHowever, it gets 1 star from me because while the investment content is very good and I fully understand patriotism, the America this, America that and constant pot shots at other countries does not belong in an investment book and because of that the book gets 1 star from me...",
    "From the initial title I thought it might be another cheesy book but turned out to be quite surprising and informative. It is good for starters but if someone that does not know EPS, average volume or even to read the charts, it can be intermediate level book. So I suggest to get the basic lingos of stock market to be studied prior to reading this book.\n\nThe material is extensive but lot of it is also promoting its website data and its ratings on investors.com which does not cover Indian markets. So Indian readers will have to dig other website for similar information. The book is strictly targeted for American markets.\n\nOverall, I found information to be useful but towards the end author included some personal political views (conservative American Republican talking points including from author Thomas Sowell) and talked about biased Democratic Party leaning left-wing propaganda which I felt was unnecessary to the educational content that book is supposed to be. I felt this information went off-topic. For this reason alone I gave the book 4 stars otherwise overall its good information on stock market and CANSLIM strategy.",
    "William O'Neil shares his strategy for making money out of the stock market by finding growth shares. It opens with a hundred pages of charts in which he demonstrates various patterns that can be used to predict price movements. This is all rather technical and may be off-putting to people who don't have much experience of investing. After this the book become more readable, and although William O'Neil is opinionated, to say the least, he argues his case persuasively. His underlying message is 'if you want to do it my way, do it exactly as I do it or don't do it at all'. Fair enough. He's earned his reputation and his CAN SLIM principles are widely used. The book has a self-promotional aspect and an American flavour that may upset some British readers, but with sales of two million it has become a classic in its field. Probably not for beginners, but the chapter on 'Twenty-one costly common mistakes investors make' is lucid and forceful, and aimed at all investors regardless of their level of experience. Strongly recommended.",
    "Too much storytelling of the past, excessive claims and ideals which more often than not do not correlate to real life. Not to mention constant selling of subscription to investors business daily. And most nauseating of all; America this, America that...I didn't want a book about nationalism!\nIl give it two stars since there are odd worthy pieces of information here and there, nothing which is not available on the internet mind you.",
    "Excellent book - I have read many trading books but took a lot from this. It is straightforward, relatively easy steps to pick a watchlist from patterns and dig deeper through fundamental information that are these days easily available on the internet. O Neill superimposes this for each stock onto the market direction as a whole and picking sector leaders.\nOne criticism - the early chapters are 150 pages of charts - these ae critical to learn the patterns. However the print size is too small to see clearly. I bought the book for making notes and the kindle version too to be able to zoom in on these charts. Annoying but it has more than repaid me !"

    "Why you should read this book: This book demystifies strategy.\n\nFor example, just setting an ambitious goal is not a strategy.\n\nThis simple truth explained my confusion listening to leaders present their “strategies” over the years.\n\nWithout a plan, a goal stands alone and is likely unattainable.\n\nA good strategy thinks through a plan to achieve that goal and gives a motivation for pursuing that goal.\n\nThe author, Richard Rumelt, illustrates this and many other points with real stories presented in quick, easily consumable chunks.\n\nThe 7 page story about Howard Schultz and the origin story of Starbucks was so well written that I shared it with my 15 year old. She said she’d never think about Starbucks the same again. Now that’s approachable writing.\n\n(And I love the iterative and discovery oriented approach that Schultz used to morph his original Italian themed cafe into what is now the Starbucks we know.)\n\nTo Rumelt, real strategy is flexible, not rigid. He calls strategy a hypothesis that needs testing, testing, testing. The parallels to Product Discovery come through again and again in this book.\n\nThe author structures a good strategy with:\n1) a diagnosis (akin to a “problem”)\n2) a guiding policy (a “solution”)\n3) coherent action (a series of “steps to achieve the solution”)\n\nA bad strategy lacks one or more of those items. A bad strategy is often just “positive thinking.” A bad strategy has a lack of focus and tries to please everyone. A bad strategy is full of “fluff” (a Rumelt formal term). Bad strategy just sets goals or makes a simple statement of direction for the company and stops there.\n\nThis book will help you analyze existing strategy and create your own.\n\nWhat’s unique about this book: The juxtaposition of good and bad strategy examples makes the author’s points much better than just advocating for good strategy.\n\nThe heavy use anecdotes and stories sets it above the average business book.\n\nIt’s also unique because it breaks down one of the largest, most mysterious business concepts (strategy) into something any of us can do.\n\nMy Advice: Try to reflect on one way you can influence your strategy for each of the techniques he covers in Part II: Sources of Power.\n\nAudience: Anybody who manages people, a budget or both. If you need to make decisions and set goals, this book will help you separate the fluffy thinkers from the serious thinkers.\n\nStyle: The book often starts with a snippet of theory and then supports it with stories from companies that the author worked with. Then to mix it up, the author will start with a story and then work in the theory as he goes. The latter style is intriguing since it keeps the reader engaged by making you guess which direction the advice will go.",
    "I thought I remembered my friend Art Petty saying that he liked Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters by Richard Rumelt. So, I emailed him and asked if that was true. Here’s his reply.\n\n“Like is an understatement. Rumelt’s kernel of Strategy is the most powerful, supple approach for creating clarity and coherence on strategy I’ve yet encountered.”\n\nArt’s no novice. He’s been an effective executive and an effective consultant for decades. He works with clients on strategy. And, guess what? The book lived up to Art’s recommendation and then some.\n\nThe kernel of Strategy that Art referred to is a great reason to read the book, even if that’s all you get out of it. Here’s Rumelt’s description of the kernel.\n\n“A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It is like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy”.\n\nThe kernel isn’t a magic formula. It’s a guide to the most important hard work you will do to create a strategy. If you’re a consultant, it’s a quick way to help you figure out if your client has a strategy or not. As Rumelt points out in the book, a lot of things masquerade as strategy. Plans and slogans and goals can look like strategy until you analyze them with a tool like the kernel.\n\nWhat makes creating a great strategy hard is that it involves choices, and we don’t like choices. We also don’t like hard work, so we skip the hard parts and just do the parts that are fun.\n\nIn my experience, an awful lot of companies spend a day or so developing their strategy. They substitute discussion for diagnosis. Talk replaces analysis. Then they trot out some fine-sounding generalities instead of taking time to craft guiding principles. Biz-speak often replaces clear language here. There’s a lot of talk about what to do, but precious little about how to coordinate activities.\n\nMost of those companies spend most of their time on what they’re going to do, after skipping the hard parts of diagnosis and guiding principles. Art says that, since reading Rumelt, he spends more time on the strategy process. He spends half of the time on diagnosis, another 40 percent on what Rumelt calls the guiding philosophy, and 10 percent on coherent actions. It’s much harder to do it that way than it is to go off to an offsite and whip up some generalities that sound good but don’t have much impact on day-to-day work life.\n\nHere’s what it comes down to. The kernel is the way you develop a good strategy. The kernel is also the way that you identify bad strategy, whether it’s yours or someone else’s. Now that I’ve read this book, I won’t think about doing strategy the same way ever again. Rumelt has helped me know some danger signals to watch for. And he’s given me a language for guiding the process of creating and evaluating a strategy.\n\nThe kernel is reason enough to buy and read this book, but there are lots of other goodies here, too. There’s analysis of many business situations that I found both absorbing and compelling.\n\nThere’s one other thing you can take away from this book. Even when you do the work to create and execute a good strategy, you can still not succeed. You can make bad choices, even with a good process. Luck still plays a role. Unforeseen events play a role. The competition plays a role.\n\nThis book was written in 2006. Rumelt makes several predictions about how some things will play out in the years ahead. He gets some of them right, some of them wrong, and some of them a mix of both. That’s a good thing because it demonstrates what’s true in real life. There are times when you can do everything wrong and have things turn out right. And there are times when you can do everything right and still go down in flames.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes about life is from the American writer and horseplayer, Damon Runyon. It goes like this: “The race may not always be to the swift, nor victory to the strong, but that’s the way you bet.” Developing a good strategy is the hard work of figuring out how to bet.\n\nIn A Nutshell\n\nGood Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters by Richard Rumelt gives you a roadmap that will help you develop better strategy. Ironically, that will make your work harder. Thankfully, it will also increase your odds of success.",
    "I found this book invaluable. Strategy, in the sense of a well-designed approach to a clearly defined problem, is often overlooked in management texts, especially with the current wave of books extolling the virtues of having a Vision, Values, and Goals (not that those are bad things, just incomplete). This book not only covers strategy in depth, it does so with reference to interesting historical stories that concretize the concepts and provide for an entertaining read.",
    "This is a wonderful strategy book, enticing and gripping, that tells us like it is on the world of bad strategy, unmasking the fluff of pseudo-strategy and flawed thought. The funniest part is when it provides a template list for mission, vision, goals with a lot of fluffy words where you just have to insert any company and industry name. Bad strategy, ridiculous as it is made obvious by such template , is prevalent. In many companies \"strategy\" is just a vaguely motivational, vacuous pie in the sky wishing amassed with political correctness statements. This without really having any notion of scope or intrinsic competitive advantage, based on unique resources and capabilities, about how to achieve the goals. Rumelt even dedicates 3 to 4 pages mocking the self help gurus from new thought who for 3 centuries now in America, sometimes using a disguise of sophistication others not even trying to look adult, propagate the belief that you just have to think positive and profits and adaptation to a changed environment will follow without deeper questions and actions. Rumelt destroys charisma as being necessarily good or sufficient for strategy. He then explains what good strategy his with both a diagnosis of the challenges and a therapy to reach the goals (Kernel). If there is one criticism of such a wonderful book is that it would be easy to have a parallel of his ideas and concepts with those of other great strategists like Porter or Mintzberg so that this could be even more useful for the strategy field, by clearly pointing out in the text, or at least creating a table of equivalence between the informal language of Rumelt and published well acknowledge concepts of strategy from other authors and mainstream textbooks also on good strategy,",
    " Strategy is an overused worth. Lots of rubbish is talked about strategy. As someone who watches trends, the question is always so what. Developing a future perspective is confused with strategy.\n\nYou do need a perspective, but strategy is about creating a favourable outcome in the future by applying focus, allocate resources and most import the actions you need to take. My conclusion, strategy is a lot of 100-day plans. Without action nothing happens.\n\nGood strategy/bad strategy is for the strategy nerds. Full of tips, examples and you will get the point the author makes. A lot of things are not strategy or are bad strategy.",
    "I've heard it said that the hallmark of genius is being able to take relatively complex subjects and make them simple to understand. Certainly, I've found myself it takes absolute mastery of a subject to really be able to convincingly whittle things down to a simple model.\n\nRichard Rumelt attempts and (I think) achieves this not only with a clear concept (what he calls the \"kernel\") but with very sound and thoroughly researched justifications. But he doesn't stop there.\n\nFor example, he shows the effect of varying the \"diagnosis\" (the first part of the kernel) and how that can radically change the strategy, with detailed analyses of real situations. This goes beyond the normal \"statement of the bleeding obvious\" (e.g. the success of Gerstner's transformation of IBM into a service organisation being the salvation of the company) into a detailed walk through of how other analysts' conventional wisdom got it wrong.\n\nI'm not going to summarise the book (you can look at the contents and \"Look Inside\" features for that), but students of strategy will see familiar concepts here: current situation/challenge definition (the \"diagnosis\"), policy and coherent action plans. True, all of this and perhaps even more is covered in other works, by Porter and others. And of course outlining the bad helps throw the good into stark relief.\n\nBut what I think you'll find here is something I've not seen often enough in strategy writing. Beyond the relatively standard and proven methods like Porter's Five Forces (for which he gives full credit), and case studies, what you'll get here is a keen analysis that breaks things down to the common sense fundamentals. This analysis is backed up with solid research, across so many sectors, that you will probably find some parallels to your situation.\n\nSo, you don't just get why the IBM's transformation strategy worked, you'll get a critical analysis of their prior situation and all the other so-called leading opinions on the subject at the time, including how they missed the mark by forgetting some simple basics (in this case, knowing the unique strengths). All of this is backed up with good use of analogy, to help you absorb the key points rapidly.\n\nVery usefully - and far more useful than templates - he provides some very simple methods to drill down on specifics. For example, he provides simple methods, with examples, that help you identify sources of power, how to accurately identify a company strategy's when even they don't know (the Crown Cork & Seal case study is very useful here), how to apply Porter's Five Forces model to critically assess a market, even if it is very new to you, and even how to win over hard-nosed cynics on the value of strategy.\n\nI like also that he doesn't pull his punches. The tone is usually respectful and academic, but down to earth. However, he cannot resist a few swipes at poor strategy and, indeed, even individuals he has met and had disagreement with in the past. There is an almost \"Office Space\" like decrying of template strategy that is only a hair's breadth away from Ron Livingstone's railing against \"listening to eight different bosses droning on about mission statements\". But I can allow him this indulgence because it is always in the context of describing bad strategy.\n\nHe's also unafraid to tell it like it is: recounting his discussion with Steve Jobs shortly after his return to Apple, he reveals not the detail of the strategy that Jobs was later to devise, but the simplicity and confidence of Jobs' approach to strategy as being as much \"waiting for the next big thing\" as anything else. Some might think Jobs flippant, but Rumelt proceeds to articulate why waiting for the right time or confluence of events (riding the waves of change, as he puts it) can be so important to latching not just onto any strategy, but the right strategy.\n\nHe is also fairly expansive in collating and presenting other useful perspectives, such as the school of critical thinking, which whilst not strictly strategy, is nonetheless an essential tool.\n\nOn the downside, whilst the conversational nature of this book is likeable, it can be frustrating if you want to get to \"the bit that deals with x, y or z\". And there are no \"templates\" or tools to use: he is quite clear that this is often the route to bad strategy, substituting for clear analysis and critical thinking (indeed, I was left agreeing with him that templates are a blocker, not an aide). But I don't think that's how this book is meant to be used.\n\nThis is simultaneously a book for the beginner, as well as a book for the experienced practitioner. Whilst it does a consummate job of explaining the fundamentals is a compelling way, it also would be beneficial to those people who know how to do this, but maybe would benefit from a fresh perspective. I certainly found it refreshing to go back through some of my strategy work and see it anew, with perhaps more critical and a clearer understanding of its flaws.\n\nI personally found this book far more valuable read cover-to-cover than as a book to dip into. As such, you might want to try this as an audiobook: I found this a very effective way to consume it, being very much like listening into a really good business radio programme on Radio 4 (or NPR, for our American cousins).",
    "The premise of the book is that a business is a coopeerative human activity and all businesses are inherently different. Strategy is the process of searching for operating procedures that could improve the performance of the organisation. The processes are discussed with a clarity and humour that exposes false prophets and explains that there are no magic wands.",
    "This book is a must read for anyone involved in developing business strategies.\nMr Rumelt goes back to the basics of the discipline and remind us what a good strategy is (not a financial objective and/or a list of \"strategic priorities\" or empty rhetoric or a half-baked vision full of buzzwords...).\nHe then articulates how to formulate a good strategy, without hiding how difficult it is.\nNo templates here, no easy success formula based on \"best practices\", no check-lis... Only insights and lots of food for thoughts from a master strategist."

    "I’m so glad I got this book! It gave me several new ideas and perspectives on how to coach people.

Thought I’d get the book early to check it out and it’s already transformed my coaching. You’ll likely learn new techniques, and more importantly new framework for approaching the craft.",
    "The book has few gems, but it is not cohesive in certain ways, some pages are just off. In the beginning chapters, the book is clearly written as if immersed in its own imaginary zeitgeist of a subset of the American culture and the authors' own experiences and hype they are riding. As a case in point, there are some erratic private definitions for concepts in the book, which are clearly on some line between oddly put to myopic; The authors give some words definitions which pile up their own additions way outside the plain English definition ― if this is just being overly presumptuous in redefining words in entirely new ways, or a way to puff up the fad or make room for selling training sessions to explain the new word meanings by re-inventing words, I wouldn't know.\nWill revisit after completing. For the less aware people, it might be an okay start, but the ideas are weaved together in a way tending toward the mediocre. The companion website is somewhat terse/shallow on each topic, rather than being more encompassing and systematic. Read this book mainly if you are absolutely clueless and didn't find any other book to your liking yet, or if you'd like to ride the fad or trend that it is promoting.\n\nFinishing the book, it goes back to that self-marketing theme in the concluding chapters, which I find to be a bad substitute for substance. I would not call this a cohesive piece of training literature.\n\nI have found the consistently interleaved parts about how things do and do not apply to a manager's work a total waist of time ― clearly this should have been a separate book so that this books focuses on one thing and focuses on it more cohesively. It's a great distractor to the flow and cohesion of the book, and I would advise skipping those parts to any reader that still goes ahead with this book.",
    "A clearly laid out guide to the principles of coaching. For those starting a practice it is a great introduction to the art and techniques of coaching.",

The book is a very engaging read and gives a lot of helpful, relatable examples. It taught me a lot about coaching and has provided an exciting foundation into the world of coaching for me.",

    "One of the best books on coaching.",
    "This was recommended to me by my own coach, although he admitted to not having read it! Some honesty right there! Reading this book has shown me that my decision at the age of 49 to start a brand new business as a coach is the right one. The way the book is laid out is just right at building the framework in my mind, without being too esoteric. It also does not read like a sales pitch for the coaching credentials, which I really liked about it. Although it does mention the ‘tools’ a lot. I imagine that as soon as I open up the tools page, I’ll get pixelled, but that’s actually fine with me. I need to learn how to do that myself and keep in mind that marketing my business is not cringeworthy!\n\nI have a lot of highlights and notes from the book and will be going through them shortly in a progressive summarisation way. There was just so much value that I feel like writing up maybe an article would be a great way for me to consolidate what I’ve learned and internalise it.",
    "Great overview of coaching with a valuable emphasis on the relationship between coach and coachee. Making sure that the relationship is balanced, yet flexible where it needs to be is a key point and the time it affords to keeping all the coaching elements in check is great.

    "The book gives you a different perspective regarding how to build software in an effective way, by putting a team first approach and given the proper tools and guides to achieve it",
    "We read this book as part of a work book club and while there was a lot of good ideas and content, many found it tough to absorb and apply. Perhaps it was not the right read for us at the time but I definitely will continue to use this book as needed, just tough to sit down and read it consistently over a couple weeks.",
    "It helps me to complement my experience. It is an easy book to understand.\nAs a non tech person, it was not hard to read. Glossary helps a lot.",
    "This book was hard for me to read and hard for me to review. It made me angry at times. Some of the recommendations of the book almost made me throw it away on the spot. Yet, I wanted to hear what the authors have to say. The further I got in the book, the more I became to see some value in what they were sharing. Yet... I would not recommend following the suggestions from this book.\n\nThis book is about teams and organizations. How should you structure your teams and the organization? It proposes four types of teams (topologies) that you might need to build products. Their argument, when you make these teams topologies clear and specify the interaction modes then that should greatly improve your product development.\n\nHowever... the whole book stands and falls with their interpretation of Conway's Law and the strict approach to code ownership they take (chapter two). They see that components/services must be owned by teams and the team design must map to the architectural structure. Personally, I disagree with both of them and worked for over a decade in environments where this isn't true... making it hard to continue the rest of the book. They also argue that teams should be separated on purpose and only coordinate with the designated interaction mode... which is the exact opposite of the environments that I enjoyed working most where interaction between teams was frequent and informal. In my experience, this level of ownership and separation is going to cause silo forming and will make building one product really hard. I would recommend against this.\n\nThe rest of the book explores the four team-topologies (stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, complicated sub-system teams, and platform teams. Of these, the authors recommend most teams ought to be stream-aligned and I would agree with that. That said... many stream-aligned teams in the same product would likely need to work on the same services/components, yet the author seems to claim that this isn't the case as good modular architecture can solve that (?!?). Here my world must be very different from the authors as I do not see how this can be resolved.\n\nThe last part explores the three team-interaction modes, (1) collaboration, (2) x-as-a-service, and (3) facilitating. The different kind of teams have different default interaction modes. Again, I found the recommendations against non-standard team interaction quite harmful.\n\nAll in all, as said, this is a difficult book to read and review. I learned from it, I liked it at times, it was vebose but written ok… yet I would never recommend it to anyone, with the exception of people who want to learn about what is the opposite of multiple teams interacting closely on shared code. For this reason, in the end, I decided on two stars.",
    "Finally a resource that looks past the agile teams and supporting business facing only products by introducing Enabling and Platform teams. I read this book twice. The first time I read it I was working at another company and many of the teams were stream-aligned and there were platform teams, so the book was more validation rather than giving me new knowledge. I am now reading it through the lens of my new company and how they are organized and I am riveted. The business unit I am in is Conway’s law amplified and the book is giving me the words to be able to communicate the problems and why. I’m looking at the communications and dependency overhead and inside I am screaming “look at the software architecture!” And “break up the DB and Ops silo!” I myself am forming a platform X-as-a-Service team for Cloud-Native apps that includes CICD, containers, microservices architecture, data analytics services, observability services and using the book to help me design the teams. It is a well written and actionable book.",
    "If you're a busy CTO, the audiobook is just as excellent as the written one.\n\nTeam Topologies highlights the problems your org chart is creating for your software's architecture (and as a result, your business).\n\nTo remedy these problems, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais offer a different perspective on org structure in the form of four fundamental team topologies: value stream aligned teams, enabling teams, platform teams, and complicated subsystem teams.\n\nThe theory behind these team structures is chiefly built upon the premise of the Inverse Conway Maneuver, which \"recommends evolving your team and organizational structure to promote your desired architecture.\"\nIdeally, this would require skilled software architects also be the architects of the teams in order to - for example - develop well-defined team APIs since software architects are already expected to be masters of API development.\n\nAdditionally, the concepts of developing sensing organizations, using Domain Driven Design to identify fracture planes, and managing a team's cognitive load are dissected to explain how to effectively structure high-performing teams.\n\nIf you have read and implemented the practices espoused in Project to Product, the Devops Handbook, and Accelerate but are still encountering communication bottlenecks and problems with scaling your existing team structures to meet product demands, then I highly recommend Team Topologies.",
    "After 40+ years as the goto for Development Management, this book replaces the still fantastic Mythical Man-Month as your first point of contact.\n\nThis collection of evidence and advice is perfectly paced, interesting, and has a lovely non-dry style that keeps you engaged. It explains an awful lot about the basics and more interesting personal interaction of Team Management that are not taught, and managers are expected to gain - experience says they often don't and wing it.\n\nIf, like myself, you have had the great fortune in the past of leading a true agile environment, and then the misfortune to have to change job to non-agile environment with a futile management team then this book will help you re-evaluate and realise you were not mad. If after presenting this information to that management then I leave you with the only option you have: GET OUT!",
    "Lots of useful content and references here, spread throughout. Also some informative diagrams to prompt discussion.\n\nI did feel however the overall content of the book could have been written in 40 pages, a lot of repetition and use of academic language when a simpler conversation style would have sufficed. It led to cognitive overload which is ironic",
    "There are many great books with wisdom on how best to form effective teams, but the trouble has always been that this folk knowledge is widely distributed and uses different words for the same things. What the authors have achieved here is to organise this knowledge in a clear taxonomy of team topologies and interaction patterns.\n\nWhat's more, they do a great job of citing other important works on the topic so that the reader can follow ideas back to their source: Melvin Conway, James Lewis, Daniel Pink, Evan Bottcher, Michael Nygard, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Allan Kelly, John Roberts, Don Reinertsen and many more are liberally quoted throughout the text. That makes this book a great summary work on a topic of vital importance to any software organisation of any size - how do we best divide the work so that teams have the best possible chance of success?",
    "Wow. It's the year 2020 and books that elaborate on the importance of teams and thoughtful team design are still ranked high on Amazon. I am in software dev for nearly two decades and during that time there were some seminar books of processes and Teams. I think of Cockburn, Tom de Marco, Nygard and Kent Beck. Those books were thin and still crammed with ground-breaking well formulated ideas.\n\nMany trustworthy people recommended this book to me and am totally disappointed how few ideas I could digest from it. It's full of repetition, lenghty convoluted sentences with many buzzwords and little meaning.\n\nThe images and diagrams are colorful. And that's the most positive I can say. Chaotic. Confusing. Vague.\nI am a single reader, but I tell you. \"This is not a book you need to read.\" The topic is important but you will not learn enough from it. Go find it elsewhere.",
    "This is a great book for people who want to create teams that deliver value. The authors define four types of teams that provide a different set of objectives. They also describe the communication between these teams making it very clear how each type of team operates in relation to each other. The punchy delivery and simple illustrations offer an easy to read resource that is also a great reference to help you establish the team structures needed to deliver value to your customers. I highly recommend this book for those who want to structure their organisation to deliver high value."

    "This book is a lifeline to sales leaders and reps. It’s changed my career. It’s written in a way that makes it easy to understand.",
    "This book was very helpful for me and provided a renewed sales education. As salespeople, we must continue to learn and adapt to new sales information.",
    "As an emerging sales leader who is looking for the right guidance from the right people, so that I can guide and lead others with the right guidance and mentality, this book is now my foundation for my sales leadership platform.\n\nI've highlighted so much in this book that almost every page is valuable.\n\nI've read a lot of sales books by a lot of authors. I've been through training by people that were taught by John McMahon. I've been led by leaders who were taught by John McMahon. I've worked in companies that were led by John McMahon. This book has tied together everything I've learned as a seller, and a lot of what I didn't know I was learning or being asked to learn, without the stress of learning it in the field, in a forecast call, or in a QBR... Learning is in the struggle, but the hot seat can sometimes be an exercise of survive and advance without real, true understanding.\n\nI feel like I can take all of the different sales processes and qualification methods I've learned and tie them into an elite sales framework based on this book.\n\nI recommend this book to all enterprise technology sellers, as a way for them to understand what their leaders are expecting of them.\n\nI recommend this book to all enterprise technology sales leaders, so they can have a framework for leading and coding their teams to greatness.\n\n(I say enterprise technology, because that is where I live, but I imagine this book will help any sales professional that has a sale that isn't purely commodity (price).)\n\nThis book has become my standard. I'm probably going to reread and reference it many times over the next few years.",
    "This book is the best sales book I’ve read because it is filled with real life scenarios, winning strategies, and immediately applicable tactics.\nIt’s a case study captured in a great story.",
    "This is one of the best sales management books that I have EVER read. It should be revered at the same level that Miller-Heiman's Strategic Selling was 35+ years ago.\n\nMost business books deliver most of their valuable content in about the first third of the book and then fill the balance of the book with fluff that makes the book long enough to be wide enough on your bookshelf as it collects dust. NOT THIS BOOK. It has brand new and valuable content all the way to the end. Even when my Kindle showed 95% finished, I was still highlighting new content and new advice that John was telling his fictional sales team that is the example in the book.\n\nI will sum it up: If you are in sales management (or want to be in sales management) then you need to read this book. If you are a salesperson and you want to do things right and win deals (even if your sales manager hasn't read this book and followed John's sage advice) then you should read this book and act like John is your sales manager.\n\nFull disclosure: I worked for John about 20 years ago and considered him to be a great sales manager back then but John didn't ask me to read or review his book. Aside from the obligatory \"Congrats on the new position\" over the years, John and I haven't really communicated in the last 20 years. All of these opinions are my own.",
    "This book is written by a 5-time CRO in the B2B tech space, so he knows his stuff. The purpose of the book is to teach a sales methodology to the reader, which he cleverly does by chronicling one of his consulting engagements. The company has no sales process, small deal sizes, and all the usual issues. He peels these things back layer by layer, and coaches them to reform their ways.\n\nI enjoyed the story because it infused life into what could have been dry material. He shares real anecdotes and proof points, and you feel like you understand why you need the methodology and how to apply it.\n\nAll in all, this was well worth the time and I feel smarter for having read it. The material jolted me out of some bad habits in how I approach things.",
    "Best sales book I’ve ever read. His podcast is great also. John is a sales legend!",
    "We can now add “writer” and “story teller” to the long list of John McMahon’s professional skills! Such a well constructed book that covers the most critical elements of sales leadership in enterprise software. Must read for all sales leaders or anyone interested in how elite sales teams should operate. This is a chance to spend a few hours inside IMO the greatest mind for enterprise software selling. I am not a fast reader, but flew through this today in one sitting, never wanting to put it down. John uniquely weaves the most critical parts of his proven sales leadership playbook through an entertaining story. For those of us lucky enough to be coached by John, many lessons will be familiar, but John offers more...he provides a glimpse into how he perceives each situation and how he prepares to help the sellers. For me, it reinforced many career changing concepts while providing new ones. The book moves very fast - and just like his real life questions, each chapter address a topic directly, offering only the most critical and impactful details. No BS - No fluff. One last thing... I'm glad that the “Grayboy” and “Peas & Carrots” stories made the cut! The lessons never get old. :-)",
    "It is really hard to find a good sales book. “The Qualified Sales Leader: Proven Lessons from a Five Time CRO” ticks all the boxes. It describes the sales process in detail, hands you a structure and gives you all the questions you need to ask. The book takes you through the journey of a consultancy assignment and, in that way, reminds me of “The Phoenix project”. It is excellent.\n\nForecasting\n\nIt starts with observing the forecast review of that company. In a forecast review, reps often find it difficult to be completely honest about their account situations. It becomes a combination of “happy ears,” rose-coloured glasses, and sandbagging efforts that force managers to qualify the accuracy of forecasts by listening to fictional stories and searching for the truth in the forecasted opportunities. With lots of superficial questions:\n\nWhy do you think you’re going to get the deal? \nHow long have you worked on this deal? \nWhen do you think the deal will come in? \nDo you think they’ll buy this quarter? \nWho is the competitor? \nIs there anything you’re worried about?\nLearning session\n\nFor it to be a learning session (as it should be), the sales reps need to accept that they aren’t the only ones with account issues. They need to learn from mistakes—theirs as well as others. The review should be utilised to coach reps and analyse their sales knowledge and sales skills. Answering these questions:\n\nDid they have a coach or a Champion?\n What information did they lack? \nWhy did the customer have to buy? \nWho had final budget approval? \nWho controlled the deal? \nWhat is the urgency to buy? \nHow will the customer justify the purchase? \nWhat is the customer’s evaluation process? \nWere they winning or losing? \nWere they in control?\nStop confusing activities with accomplishment. Stop pushing reps to rush through the sales process. Master the customer conversation with specific personas and use cases. Understand how to sell business value using a repeatable process. Learn to qualify deal advancement issues in account situations. Coach reps on how to control an opportunity. Understand how to forecast accurately.\n\nMeasurable sales process\n\nA salesforce needs to implement foundational methods and realise specific metrics before they can scale. A measurable sales process. A means to analyse the sales process and effectiveness of the sales force. Consistency and repeatability in rep performance across the salesforce with: \n\nAn increasing average new deal size \nAn expanding up-sell deal size from existing customers \nA measurable improvement in quarter-to-quarter average sales productivity\nWrong KPIs\n\nFocus on tracking meaningful indicators of deal advancement and tangible sales process results, instead of activity KPIs such as: \n\nNumber of calls \nNumber of emails sent \nNumber of video introductions \nNumber of POCs\nCreate a map\n\nA sales process should be a map for a sales rep to follow. It should have directions and steps that a rep should perform, from start to finish, to close a deal. Each sales stage needs to have defined, tangible action steps. And each stage should have exit criteria based on verifiable customer events. It gives sales leaders consistency across the sales force and tangible evidence of completed stages. Through a well-defined sales process, the customer completely understands why the product they buy differs from other products and specifically how it solves their pains. Every sales manager needs a sales process (or playbook) that is tightly coupled with a qualification method (analysis capability). \n\nConsequences of not having a sales map\n\nSmall deal sizes\nThe customer is low in the organisation.\nHigh probability of deal “churn.” \nInaccurate forecast.\nIncrease of the rep attrition rates.\nQualification method\n\nA good qualification methodology works hand-in-hand with your sales process. The qualification method informs the sales rep of their exact location in the sales process and gives instruction on the next steps. It even provides specific details required to move to the next step. Coach your reps on how to qualify appropriately.\n\nPipeline\n\nThe pipeline is the lifeblood. Maniacally qualifying deals early in the quarter by visiting the Champions of your reps’ forecasted deals in the first month of a quarter is one of the surest methods of gaining a deep understanding of your forecast.\n\nSome lessons from the book\n\nMany SaaS startups have a twenty to twenty-five per cent attrition rate.\nThe essence of profound insight is simplicity.\nIn sales, time is your enemy. There’s never enough time for follow-up sessions with customers.\nKnow the Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) to Sales Closed conversion ratio.\nSlow down the sales process to go fast.\nGet “Above the noise”. Companies live with hundreds of pains that aren’t negatively impacting the cost of running their business. At the highest levels of an organisation, business pain is related to revenue, profitability, and risk. High in the tree is where the big money lives. High in the tree is where the people who control the money live.\nMap the pain points. Without quantified pain points, there is no way to prove business value, so there is only small deals, no large deals. Quantified business pain drives higher price points. Implicated business pain drives urgency. Business pain and urgency finds business champions. Business champions get you to the economic buyer.\nYou should build an Ideal Customer Profile. An ICP highlights the customer pains, use cases, the personas owning the use cases, and companies with those specific use cases.\nCreate a list of unique and defensible product differentiators\nList the negative consequences of customers not solving the pain.\nMap the complexity of the sale. Stakeholders, influencers, departments, locations, access to CEO, POV requirements, legal, procurement, etc.\nRecruiting defines you. Hire A-players. Character is the difference-maker. Read “The rare find”.\nThere is a difference between the organisation chart versus the power chart.\nChampions won’t jeopardise their standing in the company or their influence and reputation with the economic buyer over a salesperson who doesn’t understand their business.\nEight of ten executives say that sales meetings are a waste of their time because salespeople are unprepared.\nBeware of the buyer risk when the buyer is faced with the reality of making a final buying decision.\nSwiftly acknowledge your location in the sales process.\nUnderstand the gap between known and unknown.\nThe basics \n\nA common vocabulary.  The team must adopt a shared language for all your sales terminology.\nListening. Did you know that people can listen and comprehend 250 words per minute? But most people speak at only 150 words per minute. What does that create? Impatience. Ineffective listening generates ineffective questions.\nBe HERE. Most people are in a constant state of partial attention. Mis-en-place.\nIntuition. To be an effective sales leader, you need to use your intuition to help you perceive the situation. Most people only analyse situations and make decisions with their heads. They never rely on their second powerful decision engine: their gut. A sixth sense, street smarts, intuition. Triangulate between the rep, your mind and your gut. Read “Frequency” \nSelf Awareness. What are your positive characteristics, and what role do they play in motivating your people?\nTransformational mindset. A leader’s relationship with their people should be transformational, not transactional.\nDon’t be a glorified scorekeeper. Inspire, coach and develop. Only after you’ve inspired and coached have you earn the right to inspect them.\nIntentional Outcomes. You need to understand what you expect from your people, and they need to understand what to expect from you.\nKeep it simple. Don’t overcomplicate things that aren’t complex. \nUrgent curiosity. Good questions arise out of genuine interest, a genuine curiosity to understand.\nAll classic leadership themes. \n\nCaring through competence\n\nBecause the huggers never trained and developed their people. Because caring is deeper than hugging. A hug is temporary. Competence is forever. Caring is about competence. The roots of a genuinely positive workplace culture lie in helping people win and achieve their personal goals. Reps want to be trained and developed. They want to grow. They want to be proud. When addressing a performance issue, leave your emotions at home. Don’t be biased. Drive down a line of questioning to determine whether this is a competence issue or a commitment issue. Competence issue = speak to their head. This will be more of a fact-finding discussion. It will lead to an understanding of what they should know and how they should do things. Commitment issue = speak to their heart. This is more of a feeling-finding discussion. Managers tell me to do things by speaking to my head. Leaders motivate me to do things by speaking to my heart.\n\nThe chronological order of a typical B2B sales process\n\nDiscovery. Discovery is when we learn if the client is buying what we’re selling. It’s during the Discovery stage where potential champions are identified.\nScoping. Reps need to quantify the metrics surrounding the customer’s current as-is process and define the preliminary metrics of a to-be process. The customer’s gain must be significantly larger than the customer’s pain.\nEconomic buyer meeting. The economic buyer has access to major funds. The economic buyer meeting becomes the Go/No-Go stage of the sales process.\nValidation event. The Validation event brings the sales process to its natural conclusion. You verified the priority, budget, authority, timing, and remaining process steps. You agreed on the cost, the ROI and the implementation. \nThe business case and final proposal. A final cost justification that translates the quantifiable benefits of your solution into business value in the economic buyer’s terms. (i.e., revenue, margin, risks, time to market, market share, production costs, etc.)\nNegotiate and close. For most organisations, for deals over a certain dollar size, the Procurement Department gets involved to negotiate better pricing and payment terms. Your strength comes from the decision criteria you created, which any new competitor will be judged and proof of your unique differentiation solving their pains in the validation event.\nThe procurement tricks\n\nWe have all been there:\n\nThe “pissed off for no apparent reason” approach\nThe “take it or leave it” offer\nThe “you need us more than we need you” brush off\nThe “we love you” charade\nThe “no budget” bust\nThe “good guy/bad guy” setup\nThe “disappearing friend” act\nThe “shame” game\nThe “one more thing” strategy\nThe “have a heart” scheme\nThe “it’s over” gambit\nUrgency\n\nUrgency is your friend. There is urgency for the customer to buy now. The urgency was formulated in scoping through the implication of pain. You have to anchor the price to the cost justification,” The champion verified the numbers, and the economic buyer confirmed approval to move forward based on our justification. There is verified strength in the pricing.\n\nSales is simple\n\nHave a functioning sales process. Create common vocabulary, and learn to qualify deals, identify pain above the noise, find and develop champions high in the tree, sell business value, understand business outcomes, identify red flags, win POVs, coach your people on knowledge and skill issues, and take ownership of the leadership position. Follow the steps. Nothing to it.",
    "Essential reading for any sales professional or sales leader. Covers a huge amount of the basics which people forget and foundational sales qualification frameworks like MEDDPICC whilst providing lots of real-world examples where this process has enabled better outcomes. It's a really short and easy read and you'll have plenty to learn whether you've been in sales for 1 year or 20, you can always improve!",
    "Good story style of writing. Clearly shows the strength of MEDDIC as a methodology for creating new business before any competition arrives.",
    "If you are a sales professional - get this book so you have a blueprint with which to build your success.\nIf you are a sales leader - get this book so you can deeply introspect and ask yourself if you are really leading or are a glorified score keeper.\nEssential reading!",
    "I was lucky enough to be in a sales organisation that had adopted the practices outlined in this book. It's life changing.\n\nBuy this book."

    "The Essays of Warren Buffett is a collection of writings from Buffett to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway over the last decades. There is a new edition out which might contain updated material, but this edition covers writings from the 80s till the first internet bubble. Lawrence Cunningham chooses a variety of topics and associated writings to give the reader an impression of how Warren Buffett has seen the market, investing and the variety of agency issues associated with making decisions in financial markets. The book is filled with intuitive insight and will always be relevant and all the more useful in periods when pricing and economics become disassociated.\n\nThe Essays of Warren Buffett touches on many topics. The topics included are governance investing, alternatives, common stock, acquisitions, valuation, accounting, tax and some history. Buffett starts by discussing alignment of interest and describes how him and Charlie Mungers financial fate are squarely determined by the absolute performance of Berkshire stock and how they are first and foremost shareholders. They then discuss governance structures that they approve of and characterize a bunch of structures which are weak. Though the writing is out of date with the monstrosity of packages awarded to executives today for no measurable improvement to the businesses they run, the spirit of their concerns remains more valid than ever. Boards of directors should be forced to read this to be reminded of their role. The major topic is of course investing. The authors describe a host of opportunities that they consider from long term investing identification, how to deal with the vagaries of the market and how to think about building portfolios. At the end of the day the messages are clear, one should be disciplined, use the markets emotional waves for better entry prices. Buying great businesses at fair prices is better than buying fair businesses at great prices and so on. There are many gems in the writing. There is a collection of writings on alternatives to common stock investing, including junk bonds and pref shares and convertibles. This is somewhat dated as finance has gone off the deep end embracing financial engineering without economic purpose. Nonetheless a framework for thinking about alterative payoff profiles remains insightful, though less relevant than the principles of investment chapter. The authors then discuss common stocks and the associated risks and rewards. It would be have been fascinating to have old valuation based investors transported into 2020 where stock splits elevated stocks by massive amounts on the biggest of companies (the consequence of how efficient markets are no doubt... I would love to hear Fama rationalize that phenomenon as efficient). The chapter on acquisitions remains relevant and discuss agency problems that remain issues today. They also discuss buybacks reminding the reader what a rational buyback policy should be based on rather than some of the behaviors undertaken today by management incentivized to raise the stock price above their management option strikes. The chapters on valuation and accounting are fantastic. They remind the reader what common sense but simultaneously deep perspectives are on thinking about valuation and thinking about how to think about accounting and real earnings power of businesses. These remain relevant for every market and give a framework for considering intangibles, the foundation of many modern tech giants.\n\nAt the time of this review, markets have gone into full bubble mode in many pockets. One only has to read a book like this to be reminded that, this isn't the first time and to participate rather than tread with caution will lead to regret. The writings give a timeless grounding to the thoughtful investor and this will remain full of gems for decades to come.",
    "Others have dealt with the specifics and offer many quotes from Cunningham's book. I will deal with why you need to read this book, and its source material directly.\n\nWarren Buffett has never written a book, which is sad for the rest of us, and he probably never will. At the same time, Buffett is one of the finest writers on financial thought in our society today. The clarity, brevity, perfect phrasing, and play on words that he is capable of, would lead most sophisticated readers to believe that the Sage of Omaha could have had quite a remarkable career in journalism had he chose to go another way in life.\n\nSince 1977, what Buffett has done so effectively, is personally write (no committees, or public relations firms) a Chairman's letter to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The letters (all of them) are freely available to you by going to the Berkshire website, and downloading them. The earliest letters were much shorter than the later letters, as Buffett's style writing style evolved. He was also more willing to share his thoughts in later years.\n\nLawrence Cunningham, the editor of these essays is a very fine financial mind in his own right. What he has done is organize the contents of the Buffett letters into different categories. At the same time, he has left out the technical aspects of the letters for the most part, which refers to any specific transactions Berkshire committed in any given year. This allows us, the readers to be able to go right for the wisdom that is contained in the letters. We are thus able to leap over what some readers might consider less important financial details of business transactions.\n\nIS THIS THE WAY TO GO?\n\nFor many it is better to read Cunningham's book. The choice reminds me of the joke about the two lecture halls at Harvard University. One says GOD on the door. The other says LECTURE ON GOD. Everybody wants to go to the LECTURE as opposed to seeing the real thing. In this case the real thing is Buffett's words without someone organizing them for you.\n\nAll communication is context related. You know this. If you were to download the letters, one at a time, and read them in chronological order starting with the first letter, something quite remarkable might happen.\n\nYou would be getting the PURE FLOW of Buffett's mind, from him to you directly - NO INTERMEDIARIES. Yes, depending upon your sophistication, you might not understand everything he is saying, but that doesn't matter. You'd get it, I promise you.\n\nYou'd write in the margins as I do. You would underline, or highlight what is important. You would write questions. You'd make those letters yours; in short, you would take OWNERSHIP OF THEM. At the end of your journey, you would have an extraordinary financial education.\n\nYou would learn things that you will never ever read anywhere else. This is because you would be the one interpreting Buffett, and you would have startling insights that other writers have not picked up on. Just about everybody writing about Buffett from authors, to journalists are not in the same league as the MASTER. They want to impress you themselves with their words, and their ideas, or twist Buffett's thinking and bask in the reflected glory. Please allow me to illustrate.\n\nNobody ever writes about how Buffett is hardwired in a different way than the rest of us, and this is his genius. It's no different than running into Newton, Einstein, or Leonardo da Vinci. The concept of compounding on a geometric level is in Buffett's brain while the rest of us play at an arithmetic level. This is no different than a World Champion Chess Master. The only difference between an International Grand Master (IGM), and a World Champion is that the World Champion can think one more move ahead than the IGM.\n\nIn a meeting I attended in Wall Street a couple of decades ago, Buffett said, \"One of the stupidest things you can do with money is spend it.\" Who else on the planet would say such a thing? He meant it too. Buffett doesn't think like an investor, he thinks like a businessman who is making investments, only when he makes them, they are not investments to him. They are allocations of capital. You will notice he is always talking about allocations of capital. So what does this mean?\n\nIf you can get a 20% yearly compounded rate of return for decades with no tax consequences until you sell (capital gains treatment in the end), you can build capital into the billions depending upon what you start with. Take Emerson a company you probably don't know. A dollar invested in 1956, by 2000 was worth $638. Those are Buffett type returns, and I can show you scores of public corporations that are comparable in performance. You must hold long enough to let compounding work for you.\n\nBOOK is FABULOUS\n\nYou want to read this book for the wisdom, the quotes, that you can memorize, and attempt to exploit for your personal investment advantage. We should all be grateful to the author for doing this. Buffett himself has publicly complimented the author for his work because he is the first author to give you pure Buffett without altering the Master's words.\n\nIn closing, I have read Cunningham's book several times, and you should too. Just don't forget to go to the actual source documents, the letters themselves. Carry one around with you in your pocket, and just read it in a park, in a restaurant, or anywhere else you can reflect, and work with pure genius.\n\nRichard Stoyeck",
    "The condition of the book was basically new. There was one very, very minor tear in the back cover.",
    "If you believe in following best practice and then implementing your own improvements this is definitely a book worth reading . It covers most of Buffet's annual letters to Berkshire shareholders in a chronological manner easy to follow . What makes Buffet's writing so enjoyable is the way he helps the layman understand the world of investing . It also accounts for some of the mistakes that he and his partner Charlie Munger has made and we can learn from and hopefully avoid . My only regret is not getting the paperback version since then I could have shared this book with so many more people that could have benefited from reading the book themselves .",

    "About halfway done so far and I love it! For the people complaining about too many pictures nobody forced you to get this edition lol. I for one prefer seeing the pictures while reading, makes it feel like a more complete experience. Construction and materials are perfect (didn’t realize it from pics but the actual book’s outside is some kind of silky fabric). My only gripe is i’ve already had to order 2(hopefully 3rd times the charm😅) because the first arrived with a big dent on the top and the next was even worse plus didn’t even have packaging inside to keep it from getting thrown around in the already oversized amazon box it came in but that’s more an amazon gripe so can’t knock it for that. Overall would definitely recommend if you have any interest in business. Plus always thought the martial arts was cool so makes it less of a dry read than a straight up business book and Mushashi himself can actually be pretty funny!",
    "I've bought a few books on Amazon and this is the best hard cover book I have bought so far. The quality of the book is much higher than I expected.",
    "gooood",
    "Everything was in order but the glue like spot from the photo.",
    "Not only is this a book that everyone should read and understand, this copy is also very beautiful and was well worth the money. Probably became my favorite philosophy book, just by glancing at it(already read the book before)",
    "To me, this was no 'easier' to read than the original translation I own. The headers and new layout possibly appeal to the Twitter generations - all sections broken into smaller bites. Some words were updated, e.g., 'profit' changed to 'win' and some extra verbiage was removed.\nAlso, the cover is misleading. It has a sticker that says 'more art' however the only image in this book is the sword that leads each chapter. If more art is a multiple of zero art, then the statement is correct.\nMy recommendation? Just buy an original translation and enjoy the voice of the author.\nThe first image is my original and the second is from this modern translation.",
    "The slip case is disappointing, because while its beautiful. Thats lost with the u.p.c. and price placed on the back. Ruins it as a gift and to look on. Mighr as well not have the cover.",
    "Love the book, the design and art form of the book, and the knowledge that it holds as well.",
    "Absolutely top quality paper and images! I love it from the hard case presentation and the quality of the pages! Full of images and very well cured. Printed in China and is obvious from the attention of detail that is not cheap! Amazing Christmas gift for such a price! I am extremely happy with my purchase!",
    "Such interesting book",
    "Was not expecting the book to be so well presented for the price. Recommend",
    "Beautiful product",
    "Halfway through the book in the first night. Book’s layout is nice and keeps you interested. Plus the book in general looks sweet"

    "21st century monetary policy gives the reader a picture into the theory and practice of central banking in the US. It is written by a heavyweight academic as well as Fed chairman and as such is a definitively informed account. If one is unsure of what QE is about and the role of interest rates, money supply and balance sheet management in combating inflation and closing output gaps then this is a good book to read. One should not take everything though at face value and there is bias to the beliefs about the cost benefit analysis undertaken by the Fed in the post GFC period that was under the direction of Bernanke that are potentially part of the lingering and significant inflationary dynamics we see today.\n\nThe book starts out by giving a history of the Fed and then gets into the character and views of Burns and then Volker. Bernanke does a good job of highlighting why they thought what they did and what they believed was necessary to deal with the problems at the time. In particular it is clear that economics and politics are not distinct subjects when it comes to monetary policy and different leaders viewed the intertwining differently. Bernanke introduces the theory of appropriate response to supply shocks, tools used and needed to combat heightened inflation expectations as well as Friedman's theories on money supply vs interest rates for the tools needed to combat inflation. These parts of the book are the most informative to get a sense of the history of inflation and monetary policy post Bretton Woods.\n\nThe author then moves on to the post Volker period and into the era of Greenspan and eventually himself followed by Yellen. This is where more personal anecdotes become part of the discussion as well as the views of Bernanke himself on appropriate policy. The section on Greenspan is good and covers responses to the 87 crash and the internet bubble and the difficulties in using Fed policies to prevent a bubble or even being able to identify one ex-ante. Within this narrative is the idea that the Fed should focus on the business cycle and not on asset prices; there are many who could start to disagree. The challenges with economic studies in things like monetary economics is that there are no reliable counterfactuals. We do not know absent large scale asset purchases what business confidence would have been nor consumer behavior. The data to support Fed decisions in the aftermath of the GFC were increasingly on the measurable benefit to activity from such decisions, the former chairman also clears up any misconception that the Fed in purchasing assets is printing money in some form of Weimer republic sense, which it obviously was not.\n\nWhat is starkly missing from the commentary is any recognition that the economic system itself is not stationary and so tools that had better cost benefit at one stage could ultimately become more problematic if used too much as a substitute for fiscal policy. It would be dishonest to not associate crypto bubbles with the policies out of the Fed as a function of the GFC period. That might not be directly the Fed's responsibility but the idea that they are independent of the Fed's policies is obviously untrue because the narratives surrounding so many asset bubbles was precisely the Fed's policies. Thus the lack of real self reflection on the consequences of monetary policy outside of the immediate business cycle is completely glossed over based on the earlier observation that it is not something the central bank ever really understands or knows.\n\nOverall 21st Century Monetary policy is worthwhile as an overview of the post Bretton Woods history of the Fed and one gets a distinct view of what went on after the GFC and why. It also substantiates with solid reasoning the expansion of its policy tool kit and those benefits. What is missing is the self-reflection on how an over reliance on such tools have potentially, as a generous term, led to the greater challenges of reigning in the inflation we are now witnessing under a regime shift. So, worthwhile reading but one should be a skeptic of the conviction that all actions taken were the best course possible without and accruing of moral hazard.",
    "I was drawn to this book for an understanding of QE, particularly for an explanation of how the new Fed policy framework might indicate how they will work off their large balance sheet going forward into 2023 and beyond. The author does a nice job of explaining the background and basis for QE, and as a layman I learned a good deal about the approach of the Fed to the financial crisis and the pandemic. The author is kind to the lay reader, explaining both the process and his justification for Fed policy during the financial crisis. Yet my question remains open – how can the Fed reduce their balance sheet to reverse QE?\n\nThe author opines that QE is the equivalent of about 3% of interest rate but does not associate the correlation with any particular level of QE on the balance sheet. Should one assume that his 3% relates to the 3 trillion added during the financial crisis, or the 4 trillion added for the pandemic, or the 9 trillion total? If QT is truncated after a 10 to 15% runoff, as in 2018-19, does that reduce the effect of QT to 30 bps or so?\n\nMy take-away from the author’s discussion of QT after the financial crisis is that the Fed won’t reduce their balance sheet beyond where the stock market rebels. If so, that implies that the 21st century monetary policy will result in ratcheting up the balance sheet with each new financial crisis, and the limits of that approach are not clear.\n\nThe writing is instructive for anyone hoping to understand more about Fed policy, but perhaps less useful for any non-economist seeking to understand the impact of QT. I found the writings clear and not overly afflicted with economic jargon. But in the end, the book convinced me that macroeconomics has more in common with astrology than astrophysics, and that perhaps my question cannot be answered.",
    "Central bankers are like generals; they fight the last war. In his updated history of Federal Reserve policy since the 1960’s former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spends much of his effort in his too long and textbook-like book on monetary policy from the financial crisis of 2008-09 to the present. He is rightly concerned with operating monetary policy under the constraint of a zero-bound policy rate that for the most part has been the case since 2008. However, he ignores the new war to come as inflation becomes more endemic.\n\nHe discusses the role of the Fed as a lender of last resort in the tradition of Walter Bagehot where unprecedented lending in face of the financial crisis in 2008 and the pandemic of 2020 where the Fed came close to discounting practically anything, perhaps even my personal IOU. To be sure the Fed did save the day in both cases, but in the case of 2008, it gave rise to a populist movement on both the right and left which saw the Fed bailing out the big banks, but not the proverbial little guy/gal.\n\nBernanke cites his interest in monetary policy came from reading Friedman and Schwartz’s “A Monetary History of the United States 1867-1960.” I too had a similar experience. However, where the role of money is central to Friedman & Schwartz, aside from the 1970’s, it is only peripheral in Bernanke’s work. My guess is that Bernanke will regret not mentioning the explosive growth in the money supply over the past two years.\n\nI wish he would have devoted more time to the role of the Plaza Accord in 1985 in which the finance ministries of the G-7 orchestrated a decline in the international value of the dollar. The Fed aided and abetted that process which in my mind ignited the commercial real estate bubble of the late 1980’s. That did not end well, and it nearly broke the U.S. banking system, so much so that the Greenspan Fed in late 1991 lowered the discount rate by 100 basis points. As an aside I participated as a real estate expert in a briefing to the Board of Governors just prior to the rate cut.\n\nThe reason Bernanke and the Fed are fighting the last war is that it is my contention that the U.S. economy entering a new thirteen-year cycle that will be characterized by much higher inflation than we have been used to. It will involve more than a cyclical rise in inflation that Summers-Furman-Blanchard warned of that Bernanke rightly noted in his book. Further, if inflation were measured the same way it was in the 1970’s where house price changes rather than owners’ equivalent rent was used to calculate the housing component of the consumer price index, year-over-year inflation would be running in the 12-13% range, not the 8% currently being reported. Simply put, the house is on fire.\n\nInflation will become more endemic because the economy is deglobalizing and decarbonizing at the same time. Both will lead higher energy prices specifically and higher overall prices as limitations will be put on the international division of labor in an environment of an aging global workforce. This will lead to a substantial increase in capital expenditures as production is in-shored and huge investments are made in energy transition. As a result, not only will inflation increase, but the real neutral rate of interest, R*, will increase as well. Add to this higher defense spending to deal with an aggressive Russia and increased concerns about China, interest rates have nowhere to go but up.\n\nNet net. Instead of worrying about the last war’s zero bound, the Fed will be worried about the new war of fighting an inflation amidst a capital spending boom.",
    "El libro resume perfectamente las actuaciones macroeconómicas de la Fed en situaciones similares a la actual. Muy recomendable, Bernake es un genio y una persona con mucho criterio. El libro aporta mucho conocimiento pero si no te gusta mucho el tema macroeconomía se puede hacer algo pesado."

    "There is a crack in one of my core beliefs. The crack was created by reading Dan Pink's book.\n\nHere's the Core Belief: Selling is for people who are tough skinned.\nI'm not tough-skinned.\nI don't need to learn how to sell.\n\nSUMMARY\nPink begins the book by defining \"sales\" in the traditional way, that 1 in 9 of us makes a living by pushing products and services.\n\nIt has always been clear to me that ABC (always be closing) is the ideal and that I could never sustain the effort to pursue a client so passionately and so persistently. Now I see that I'm part of the 8/9 that is not the \"obvious\" sales person, but rather I'm in the \"persuader class\" -- so we teachers are all persuaders and we are always trying to find new ways to ask people to part with resources (time, attention and effort) to achieve something else.\n\nTEACHERS: If you want to see details, then read on. Otherwise, just buy Pink's book. It's worth $20 to get a lesson plan for our students.\n\nIf you teach the 7 Essential Skills for competing in the global economy (the Tonhy Wagner list), then you need this book.\n\n=====\n\nThe idea of a global community connected on the web is clearly a \"haves and have nots\" situation. The hotel wants to charge $28 U.S. for a 24-hour use and there's an outside contractor that offers in-hotel machines at $9.60 for an hour.\n\nIMBALANCE between sellers and buyers...\nDan Pink's book TO SELL IS HUMAN is becoming more and more relevant for my teaching aims. I can see that my students need Pink's viewpoint to help them navigate the older attitude toward sales (which is largely described by \"the used car salesman.\") \"Caveat emptor\" attitude reigns here in Australia. Pink describes the new environment of \"caveat venditor\" seller beware... because the buyer has access to just as much info as the seller.\n\nI recommend Pink's description of the imbalance that \"always be closing\" generates and he offers three new ABCs: A_______(attunement), Buoyancy and Clarity.\n\nattune students to the buyer (listen, don't constantly close)\nbe upbeat and positive (buoyant) in the ocean of rejection\nbe clear about what is important and balance the positivity with data about how they are actually performing in the market\n\nYou can find a good summary of the TO SELL IS HUMAN on the Internet and Pink offers the first chapter. Perhaps in four or five years it will be generally recognized that this book is REQUIRED READING FOR EDUCATORS.\n\nI thought that Pink had gone corporate, wanting to turn us all into marketing agents for brand X, but I misinterpreted the author's intent. He has been writing a series of connected books.\n\nFree Agent Nation: Pink described in 2001 the rise of the independent contractor\n\nA Whole New Mind: he described the capacity that we all (especially independent contractors) need to develop in ourselves to compete with Asia.\nHe described the work (the niche) that automation and abundance offer us to grow into.\n\nDrive: \"How to motivate ourselves and others\" is what we independent contractors need to understand... Dick Clark claims that Pink is overgeneralizing about \"what motivates others\" beyond money, but I like the idea that we can move people by appealing to Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.\n\nTo Sell is Human: It is clear that we independent contractors can create business for our skills. We need to prepare people to persuade others to part with time, attention and effort to do something else (which is the heart of selling).\n\nIn other words, these four books are part of a curriculum. Dennis Yuzenas gets it. His focus on \"building skills\" at Oxbridge Academy has resulted in dozens of students who are focused on the Tony Wagner list of skills.\n\nI have a friend who told me, \"I read the Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Monthly because smart people will tell me what is important.\" That's how I look at Dan Pink's oeuvre. He has set up a curriculum that we all can choose to reach for.\n\n=========\n\nI'm writing this message in the lobby of a hotel in Sydney. Import duties cause books to cost $40 when the hard cover might be $25 in the USA. Fewer people will have access to Pink's ideas and that's why I'm leaving my copy of the book over on this side of the Equator. I recommend that people in the USA make a friend in the Southern Hemisphere and send a copy of TSIH to a teacher there.\n\nI also need to send a copy of TSIH to Enrique's school Highland Park High School to go with the growing shelf of \"cool books from Florida\" (my name for the collection of books that I left in the school to attract the students who might be curious).\n\nThis somewhat disjointed email documents how disruptive Dan Pink's writing is. I have resisted reading his new book since Dec. 10. That's 70 days of resistance since I first read the free chapter in December.\n\nIt has always been clear to me that ABC (always be closing) is the ideal and that I could never sustain the effort to read so long and so persistently. Now I see that I'm part of the 8/9 that is not the \"obvious\" sales person, but rather I'm in the \"persuader class\" -- so we teachers are all persuaders and we are always trying to find new ways to ask people to part with resources (time, attention and effort) to achieve something else.\n\nAttention, Effort and Time is another triplet composed by Pink, to go with\nAsia, Automation and Abundance\nAutonomy, Mastery and Purpose\n\nTeachers, if you have this book on your desk, if you write key page numbers on the edge of the book and encourage your students to read about the new ABCs, attunement, buoyancy and Clarity, then you will have done your job well..... the job of preparing kids for the future.",
    "This is a great book. It started off slow but once you get into the meat of the book you will not be able to put it down. I found myself highlighting so many passages from the book. Can't wait to read back over my highlights! Definitely worth the purchase!!",
    "Arthur Miller created the archetype of the insecure, self-deluded traveling salesman in his Pulitzer-Prize winning play, Death of a Salesman. I have my own Willy Loman story.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I earned extra money by lugging around a sample case of candles and selling door to door. There were, of course, the easy marks; my parents and the next-door neighbors. Beyond the comfortable confines of my immediate neighborhood, it was a teenager's view of hell - doors slammed, fingers wagging no from behind lace curtains, and the one-hour pitch that led to \"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\nLike most Americans, I have a rather dim view of salespeople. In fact, it is usually ranked among the most distrusted professions along with stock traders, politicians, dentists, and lawyers.\n\nWhich is surprising, because Dan Pink, the author of the new book, To Sell is Human; the Surprising Truth About Moving Others was a lawyer. Pink, the author of such best sellers as A Whole New Mind and Drive takes a fresh and engaging look at the art and social science of selling. In fact, his thesis is that in one way or another, we are all salespeople.\n\nPink begins with some provocative statistics - the result of his study with Qualtrics, a research and date analytics company. The study, What Do You Do At Work?, revealed \"that people are now spending 40 percent of their time at work engaging in non-sales: selling - persuading, influencing and convincing others in ways that don't involve anyone making a purchase. Across a wide range of professions, we are devoting roughly twenty-four minutes of every hour to moving others.\"\n\nThe book makes a compelling argument that \"we are all in sales now\" because while the existing data show that 1 in 9 Americans work in sales, the new data reveal so do the other 8 in 9.\n\nIn all of his books, Pink (Like Malcolm Gladwell) uses behavioral economics and science to illuminate a subject - in many ways, counterintuitive to what many of us believe.\n\nFor example, he cites a 2008 experiment where researchers simulated a negotiation over the sale of a gas station. (I assume this was before the great financial meltdown.)\n\n\"Like many real-life negotiations, this one presented what looked like an obstacle: The highest price the buyer would pay was less than the lowest price the seller would accept. However, the parties had other mutual interests that, if surfaced, could lead to a deal both would accept.\"\n\nPink continues, \"One-third of the negotiators were instructed to imagine what the other side was feeling, while one-third was instructed to imagine what the other side was thinking. (The remaining third, given bland and generic instructions, was the control group.)\"\n\nThe result? The empathizers (feeling) struck many more deals than the control group, But the perspective takers (thinking) did even better: 75% of them managed to fashion a deal that satisfied both sides.\n\nThe authors of the study, Adam Galinsky, Joe Magee, M. Inesi add Deborah Gruenfeld and another study by William Maddux showed that \"Empathy...was effective but less so, and was, at times a detriment to both discovering creative solutions and self-interest.\"\n\nPink also dispels the myth that extroverts make the best salespeople in today's economy and that the \"Ambivert\" - someone who is somewhere between an extrovert and an introvert is the rising star in moving people.\n\nIf you're familiar with the classic Alec Baldwin uber-salesman scene in David Mamet's Glengarry, Glen Ross you'll know that the ABC scribbled on the chalkboard means, \"Always be closing.\" (For movie fans, Mamet wrote that scene for Baldwin and is not in the original play).\n\nPink has rewired and rethought the ABC of the new world of selling and it's Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity. Like his other books, he complements each idea with relevant case studies, strategies and a number of insight exercises.\n\nHe offers six successors to the standard elevator pitch. Shows you why problem finding may be a smarter strategy than problem solving, and how skills in improvisation can dramatically improve how to move people.\n\nAll of which makes To Sell Is Human - a delightfully useful read. Essentially, Pink is reframing what \"selling\" is all about. We are all salespeople because everyday we are selling ideas, positions, and strategies to other people. I highly recommend it.\n\nI know Dan personally and marvel how there are very few pictures of him without a purple shirt and he doesn't disappoint in To Sell Is Human. So, I requested a preview copy and bought my own Kindle version as well.\n\nI first met him at a book signing at BIF (Business Innovation Factory) and what impressed me is that he didn't simply sign books; he had short, meaningful conversations with everyone. I think he's a reluctant salesperson. Dan is more interested in sharing information and ideas than selling you a product or service.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's the foundation of the new age of sales - how to move others, by moving yourself.\n\nAnd for anyone wishing to sell candles door to door, the Pray Hands cylinder candle was a big hit.",
    "Bought this on the strength of Drive. Maybe I'm more grown-up now but I found the intro distinctly unpersuasive. You can watch him bend the research findings to add weight to his claims that they do not deserve. Then he claims that Palantir \"simply requires each new hire to read two books, one is a nonfiction account of...\" since he doesn't tell us what books, I googled it and found it to be untrue. Different employees get different books. So the author it's building on a foundation of myth. I expect it's a very good book for getting by in Pink's mythical world, but I would like to see more rigor from a book based on the real one.\nAnd now I'm wondering what I have to un-learn from Drive.",
    "Q: What does a book on ‘Selling’ have to do with teachers?!? A: A great deal apparently! Pink starts by pointing out two facts: a) the fastest growing fields today are Ed – Med (Education and Medicine – ok, we sort of knew that) and b) an incredible 40% of our time is spent in non-sales selling!! We sell clients on how great we are and we sell learners on English (or maths, history, etc.)! That involves a lot of presentation, communication and persuasion skills. Pink can help us with all three of them.\nPink has studied communication extensively and he has lots of interesting things to say on how to write catchy e-mail titles (p. 167), tweets (p. 170) and why using visuals is so important (p. 180). But he also gives us the results of a number of studies on such fascinating topics as...\n...Labelling (p. 138): In a Prisoner’s Dilemma type of game, 33% of the participants cooperated when they were told it was called ‘The Wall-Street Game’ but the number doubled when others were told they would be playing ‘The Community Game’. The same effect was found when some students were labelled ‘tidy’ as opposed to a controlled group (Moral: Label you students positively and they will live up to the label!)\n...Facilitation (p. 142): In another study, students who had been singled out for their pro-sociality by their peers, were asked to contribute to a food drive for charity. The same was done with others classified as ‘selfish’. The results: 8% of the former but 25% of the latter donated food! Why? The ‘selfish’ students had been given clearer instructions about what to donate and when! (Moral: motivation aside, direct behavioural instructions [‘Do this!’] can go a long way towards ensuring compliance).\n...Persuasion Techniques: Here is one: instead of asking students whether they have studied for a test which might trigger ‘Psychological Reactance’ we could ask them ‘How ready are you for the test? Say on a scale from 1 to 10?’ When they answer, we can then follow up with the fantastic ‘Why not a lower number?!?’ This forces them to focus on the positive (what they have done) and shows them what they still need to work on! Excellent!! (p. 213)\nWhat makes the book so readable is that Pink also gives readers many real life examples. Here is my favourite one: On page 213 of the book there is a picture which hangs on the wall of an Italian restaurant. The picture is that of the owner and it reads: ‘If you had anything less than a great experience at ‘il Canale’, please call my cell: 703-624-2111’!! Now think: how many DOSs would be prepared to do such a thing? :-)",
    "“To sell is human” is a basic book about sales. When I say that, it’s a great book if you are a business leader, entrepreneur, launched a start-up or have suddenly just got a role where you have “business development” as an objective. Sales may have never been part of your life plan, the thought of it might concern you or even terrify you.\n\nMany of us think that “sales” means this “gift of the gab”, extrovert that talks all the time and we think that isn’t us, therefore we cannot sell. Daniel takes you through that actually sales isn’t like that and in fact we all can sell. In fact, we can all sell, all of the time.\n\nThe book is well researched and also provides advice and guidance for anybody taking their first steps into sales.",
    "In my opinion this is not the best book by Daniel Pink.\nIt is interesting, but it wasn’t flowing as his other books. Moving at slower pace with too many “3 things to do” lists for my taste.\nI think it’s a bit too stretched to make the point that selling is an everyday activity.\nYes, it’s true we all “sell” (move people as he writes), and if you think we’re not this book will be beneficial for you.\nThere are good suggestions how to efficiently move people in a positive way, but still it left me with a feeling I should have invested my time differently.",
    "26 years ago, when I left university, I would have been horrified to learn that I would end up in sales. But here I am. And Daniel Pink is absolutely right, we all have to be in sales these days, especially if we're self-employed.\n\nI work as a speechwriter, and that's where Daniel Pink began, working for Al Gore. All this stuff is relevant to speechwriting - and as speechwriting embraces blog posts, Twitter and other outputs these days, the techniques he passes on about improv theatre, rhyme and one word pitches are fun and worth putting into practice every day.\n\nI'd read about Joe Girard, the famous car salesman, and Dan Pink puts his theories into context. The world has moved on a long way since the mantras like 'Always be closing'. The internet gives us most of what we need to know about products and services. The sales people have to work with that grain.\n\nHe tells a nice story about one of the last door-to-door salesmen and gives us some good buzzwords for sharpening our technique for the C21st - his ABC is 'Attunement, buoyancy and clarity'.\n\nHis Pixar story structure technique is also just the kind of thing you want as a takeaway from a business book. I was really glad I picked up this book, I'll be working with it for at least the next six months."

    "I recommend this book for anyone who is trading. It explains day trading but more importantly it explains why and how you should trade with the mindset of a business owner not as a hobby.",
    "I started trading back in december of 2020 not really knowing too much. Buy low and sell high although due to most brokers alerting you about the day trades are hitting close to the 4 limit. I learned quickly that I more enjoy swing trading as it's less stressful for me. But so far in this book I have read a couple chapters (and will add more to this review once I finish it), and with that I have learned significantly that day trading is what I want to do eventually. First is growing my assets to meet requirements to day trade with the budget I have started my initial trading portfolio. Now with regards to the book.\nFirst I was realizing that day trading is a beast that I don't fully grasp or understand to the degree, yet. But I will say the first couple chapters I have read so far give you some insight and fundamentals to get you in the mindset of trading as a profession. I appreciate the attention to details. For example when I came to the idea of training as a source of income I just thought just that. I want money. But this book also gives you suggestions and questions to ask yourself as you go along your journey. I have then realized that in wanting to day trade one day that I just really enjoy number crunching and the rush of watching numbers go red and green. I definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in even just understanding the fundamentals as this will give you a lot to work with in improving yourself and your mindset going forward.",
    "I was disappointed that there was not enough information to make graph and chart reading easier.",
    "Well written, and does a fantastic job of explaining the steps to success, while protecting your money as you are learning.\n\nHe had one nugget on examining the “why” you are trading that was priceless. Stated in a way that resonated with me, and has been useful.\n\nA great book for beginners and beyond.",
    "Was a great into into charts, psychology, and terms, however all the examples were given for Options. This was very confusing for a beginner trader looking to strictly trade stocks. It really didn't give you the information on how to take the information that was provided for Options and apply it to a stock scenario. Author also emphasized what a trade plan should consist of, that you should back test it, and then move to trading it if it's valid, however never really went through any real world scenarios on how that actually looks or takes place. Author also gives zero information on how to set up scanners to find viable trades. Good beginner information on Terms, Psychology, and basic Charting, but lacks in actually getting you up to a point to trade. If you're not specifically looking at Options trading, I'd look for another book that is Stock related.",
    "For the first time, I feel that I am understanding Day Trading and if I should try it or not. Written in plain English and written FOR ME - a totally clueless, uneducated in trading, reader. I got this book, because it's impossible to ignore the stock market right now with one high after another. Reading the headlines, I always feel so stupid for not being in the stock market right now. While the rest of the world is \"locking down\" and becoming homeless and broke, the stock market is riding high (apparently due to \"Quantitative Easing\") and making some people rich. This book is the first to make me ignore the headlines and seriously consider if I should try Day Trading.",
    "I read this from cover to cover good read came away with more questions yet not in a bad way got me thinking about what I wanted exactly and how to obtain that goal coold I trade with the ideas here yes I think so but it defines almost all types so there are more specific books to go deeper in to specific types - great starter",
    "This book is awesome. I learned so much from this book, though I am a swing trader. To the author: Thank you for the \"Alligator\", which helps me understand when to sell. I have been preaching your 25 perfect trade rule to anyone that will listen and they love your rule. I am starting to get into covered calls and I am practicing your 25 perfect covered calls rule. I wish you would write a book on swing trading. As a teacher, I do not have time to day trade, but swing trading is doable. I recommend this book to any type of investor.",
    "The book does not provide a real world scenario of stock, a lot of things to be desired. The chart for patterns of entry and exit is not accurate by measure. Through reading this book, I find the author enjoys informing readers how successful one can be through the techniques and psychology instead of the real world examples that you expect to learn from, and if you are planning to trade stocks, do not bother with this book, as it is mainly focused on indecies and futures. And if you want to learn the common or popular stock charts, such as yahoo finance etc, there is none. the author uses PIP charts, and so far, there is nowhere to be found for stocks. I checked yahoo finance, trading212, Webull, and many others who provide free charts, no available for the chart the author use. I wish I could return this book, such a waste of money.",
    "Overall a good read, if you want to start educating yourself how to day trade. It’s well structured, explains things in a comprehensive way and gives good tips. My lack some depth and details here and there, but again this is a quick start guide!",
    "Not worth a penny",
    "This is a good book for someone that has little to no knowledge of stock market. It explains both the business side and the personnel side of ay trading at a low level, that is easy to understand. I think it is a good book to start with and study, before moving on to a more in depth and comprehensive format. I usually read 1 or 2 chapters at different times of the day usually when waiting at my appointments. Then when I have time later on usually a day or two later I read another chapter, so I don't get to much info crammed in all at once. So again this book is good for people who have little to np knowledge of the market and want some easy reading to help them understand how trading works.",
    "The book was distracting with all the spelling and grammar errors. I will definitely will be looking elsewhere for other sources.\nOther than that, meh"

I would highly recommend this book to anyone struggling with procrastination but it's not limited to just that. This book can help you identify some of the ways you sabotage yourself even if you are not a \"procrastinator\".\n\nHope that helps.\nG",
    "The author has captured just about every characteristic one can imagine in this masterpiece. It covers personal life, business, and career oriented blockers that everyone has experienced. I wish I had a book like this in college, where I wrote a paper on this topic - the night before it was due! I had similar early career and life experiences so wrote to learn about it. But this book will help you address these issues.\n\nThe author delves into how behavior matters and provides strategies and process to take these head on to minimize or eliminate the distractions that cause delays and procrastination. From how you live your daily life to how successful you are in your chosen career, the author has included methodologies to help guide the reader down the right path.\n\nConsider your mindset, how you learn, how you can benefit from failures, how to deal with fears, how to eliminate various distractions and the guidelines to implement action plans.\n\nIt’s important to note that the author uses all personal experiences as he has lived with these issues and found the ways to work through and around them.

    "If you’re looking for a guidebook to help you move forward on projects that continue to get set aside, look no further. This book is a solid dose of inspiration that will inspire you to get things done. Not only will you be given practical suggestions for doing the hard things first, but you will also be presented with the primary reasons why people procrastinate and avoid the bigger projects in life.\n\nI think the section about the underlying reasons for procrastination was my favorite section because I recognized some of my own tendencies. When you don’t have any self-awareness about your bad habits, it’s just not easy to create lasting change. This is a very well-written and organized book that will encourage you to make changes, but it will also require you to do a reasonable amount of self-reflection. If you’re ready to put in the work and take action, read this book. You’ll be happy you did.",
    "I’d always been massively productive until about 10 years ago. I decided it was due to the heavy work responsibilities and the kids’ busy age. But as the kids left home, I was faced with the reality that those things were just convenient excuses to avoid what really needed to be accomplished. Productive me was a procrastinator.\n\nDo the Hard Things First is a huge relief for me - now I see my issue clearly and have a step-by-step plan to move forward instead of sideways or back. Scott Allan’s book is easy to read but provides definitive steps I can follow to accomplish my REAL goals. One of his beat books yet!",
